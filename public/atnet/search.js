      title: "The 2022 SNAFUs: What Were The Biggest Mistakes New Crypto Investors Made in 2022?",
      content: "Crypto trading and investing can sure be exciting and indeed a money machine if you do it right, but it’s not without its fair share of risks.\n\nThese days, there are newbie-friendly exchanges, but there is still a steep learning curve to trading.\n\nAnd then, even if you have experience with legacy investing, there are still some big mistakes new crypto investors often fall into that can cost them money.\n\nIf you are new to the crypto world, here are some of the most common mistakes to avoid, especially if this is your first time dipping your toes into the cryptocurrency waters.\n\n1/ Keeping Crypto in Online Wallets\n\nTo a lot of crypto traders who onramped in 2021 or later, web3 wallets and hosted wallets seem like the only way to store cryptocurrency.\n\n\n\nBut as the 2022 Solana wallet drainage showed, it is worth trying to avoid keeping it stored in hot wallets for too long. These wallets can be considered to be vulnerable due to potential security flaws, which then makes them a target for hackers.\n\nFor those who wish to continue to use them, it could be considered worth just keeping a small amount in a wallet, while also having a more robust cold wallet like Ledger in order to best protect themselves from an attack.\n\n2/ Lack of Rudimentary Knowledge of Crypto\n\nThe excitement around virtual assets may draw in new crypto investors, but the influencers conveniently forgot to pass on anything else but memes.\n\nBut in crypto, the technical knowledge of the asset class and its operations is crucial. During the Luna collapse, investors would admit on Twitter they did not understand what elastic supply meant. They somehow assumed that every crypto is at its core pretty much the same as Bitcoin.\n\nIt is a formula for disaster to try to trade crypto or just invest in any asset you don’t comprehend without having a fundamental knowledge of how cryptocurrencies operate.\n\n\n\nYou may have noticed that a bitcoin casino has become available to utilize that gives everyone around the world the ability to use their crypto to bet on sports or their favorite games. This is one of the use cases that resulted in a lot of new people getting into crypto. The issue is that with crypto, you are your own bank. If you do not have the knowledge of how to handle your crypto, then you could be in for an expensive lesson.\n\nA cursory research will usually do it, though, so it is certainly worth spending the time.\n\n3/ Poor Storage of Passwords and Seed Phrases\n\nThis one is an evergreen.\n\nCryptocurrency is stored in a digital wallet and access to the wallet app usually needs a password or a PIN code.\n\nWhile your cryptocurrency is easy to recover when you lose the password or PIN, you will not recover it if you lose your seed phrase.\n\nMost wallets offer a backup seed word to access the cash, but if you forget or lose the seed phrase, or if you don’t store it well and get it exposed, there will be no way to get your money back.\n\n4/ Short-term Thinking\n\nMany new investors only think in the short term due to the market’s promise to “get rich quick.”\n\nAnd although investing in cryptocurrencies seems like it has certainly done just that for some people, the reality is that most of these people got in when everyone and their grandma told them it is a scam bound to crash any second, and they kept stacking for a few years through that.\n\nSome say that the market is a device that redistributes money from the rash to the patient. Either way, the potential to yield good returns still exists in crypto, just as the risk of a devastating loss.\n\n\n\n5/ Use of Leverage\n\nShocker: 100x is bad for you.\n\nStories of people making it rich through cryptocurrency trading may tempt new crypto investors to fire up that leverage to increase their earnings.\n\nLeveraged trading has its place for sure. But the drawback is that it requires you to maintain collateral. Leverage has two sides and can increase your gains and losses.\n\n\n\n6/ Getting Scammed\n\nScammers thrive in the crypto market since it is a new asset class. Since its early days, the business side of crypto got regulated. Unsurprisingly, that doesn’t stop scammers on Twitter and in the airdrop industry.\n\nAnother type of common scam is phishing. You probably received an email or a text from an imposter urging you to update your Trust Wallet or your Exodus. Phishing is just a reality of the crypto industry.\n\nAlways check the sending email address and never give your seed phrase to anyone.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nCrypto trading and investing is certainly a general high-risk endeavor. There are multiple risks to consider, but the biggest is that you never really know what the future holds. It’s an exciting time to explore these new financial markets, but there are also plenty of things to watch out for.\n",

      title: "Crypto SEO: Getting Organic Traffic For Your Cryptocurrency Project",
      content: "The crypto niche has been growing and developing, adding new features almost every year: Altcoins, dApps, NFTs.\n\nEven though some people consider any crypto a risky investment, some forecast the growth in popularity of crypto. Some are interested in crypto not only in terms of investing but also in running crypto businesses.\n\nThe niche requires more and more niche services so there is a lot of potential for business owners to develop and expand.\n\nAs the crypto industry is booming, SEO strategies that were once used to promote a website in this niche are no longer effective. Google algorithms are constantly changing and evolving too, so SEO specialists need to keep up with the latest trends and update their approaches.\n\nIn this article, we will tell you about the most effective SEO practices for getting organic traffic to a cryptocurrency website in 2022.\n\nWhat Is SEO for Crypto?\n\nCrypto SEO is a marketing niche that focuses on traffic generation in the crypto industry.\n\nIt measures and methods aimed at improving the visibility and organic search results of a website in Google and other search engines.\n\nThe main goal of crypto SEO is to make a site takes one of the leading positions in SERP for the targeted queries. If you want to use the most effective strategies, address the СryptoSEO Agency and their professionals will help you achieve your business goals.\n\nSEO for cryptocurrency includes such activities as:\n\n\n  On-page optimization;\n  Technical optimization;\n  Link building;\n  Content marketing, etc.\n\n\nThe goal of every crypto SEO expert is to bring organic traffic to the website for queries related to its niche. As in any other industry these days, that won’t happen without SEO work.\n\nWhat to Consider When Doing Crypto SEO?\n\nWhen promoting a website in the cryptocurrency niche, you need to take into account some of the specific features of this industry. Here are some things to consider when doing crypto SEO:\n\nThe niche is constantly evolving;\n\n\n  New projects appear every day;\n  Google algorithms are changing;\n  The number of searches is growing;\n  The competition is high.\n\n\nGiven the specifics of the crypto industry, it is good to keep track of the latest trends and update your content and promo strategies accordingly. For instance, several trading platforms adapted to change in the market and started offering airdrops and promos to attract people who are new to crypto.\n\nOnly by following the latest trends and using effective methods, you will be able to achieve success in promoting your website in this niche.\n\nHow to Do Crypto SEO?\n\nThere is no single answer to the question of how to do crypto SEO and you will almost always need to find a targeted approach with an agency.\n\nThe best way to promote a website in this niche depends on various factors, such as the goals, budget, and target audience of the project.\n\nHowever, there are some universal tips that will help you promote your website effectively:\n\n\n  Use long-tail keywords;\n  Conduct keyword research;\n  Optimize your website for mobile devices;\n  Improve the user experience on your site;\n  Publish high-quality content;\n  Build links from crypto websites.\n\n\nThese are just some of the basic things you need to consider when doing crypto SEO. If you want to get more organic traffic, you should also make sure that you are using other approaches.\n\nLet’s have a look at some of them.\n\n\n  \n    Content\n\n    The first and most important thing you need to do is to create quality content. It should be informative, well-structured, and based on reliable sources. Google loves high-quality content and it will definitely help your website to rank higher. You can also use various tools to check whether your content is good enough.\n  \n  \n    Use relevant keywords\n\n    You would be surprised how many seemingly niche websites get most of their organic traffic from completely unrelated keywords!\n\n    You should always target relevant keywords. They will help both Google and advertisers to understand what your website is about and index it accordingly. You can use various tools to find the most relevant keywords for your website.\n  \n  \n    Make sure your website is mobile-friendly\n\n    Nowadays, more and more people use their smartphones to browse the Internet. That is why it is crucial to make sure that your website is mobile-friendly. Google also takes into account whether a website is mobile-friendly when ranking it. You can use various tools to check your website’s mobile-friendliness and make the necessary changes.\n  \n  \n    Use social media\n\n    Social media is a great way to promote your website. You can automate creating posts about your project on various social media platforms with marketing tools, there is plenty of them to choose from.\n  \n\n\nWhy is SEO important?\n\nGoogle and other search engines, responding to user requests, collect, systematize and display information. To release relevant information, they go through three main processes, including:\n\n\n  Scanning. Search engines use crawlers, also known as web spiders or simply bots, to find fresh content on the Internet. Search robots help to identify and collect information necessary for indexing a page. Bots go from page to page, link to link to scan all the information.\n  Indexing. The process by which search engines organize and store web pages they collect. As soon as search engines find information such as keywords and fresh content, they will add the web page to the search index. When users search for certain information, the search engine selects the appropriate indexed site.\n  Rating. Next, a ranking of the results will be formed depending on the relevance - the pages that, in the opinion of the search engine, are the best for the search query will be shown first.\n\n\nSEO improves your online presence by making your site more attractive to search engines. In other words, search engine optimization determines how successfully your site will go through the entire process - from crawling to ranking.\n\nFor example, well-structured internal links on your pages make it easier for search engines to navigate from one page to another. This allows them to study the resource in detail and index more content. Search engine algorithms also take into account other ranking factors, such as relevant keywords, quality of external links, and content relevance (how long it has been updated). Thus, optimizing the content of the site taking into account these factors can significantly improve its position in the search.\n\nIn Conclusion\n\nThese are the basic but still effective SEO practices for promoting a cryptocurrency website in 2022. If you follow these tips, you can’t fail to get positive results. For a targeted plan it is always best to work with an agency, though.\n",

      title: "[Ready To Automate] VTrend Volume Trading Strategy on TradingView - Premium Script",
      content: "VTrend is a volume trading strategy with a bunch of features packed into a single TradingView script.\n\nOn the face of it VTrend looks a bit like Ichimoku cloud but it’s made of different market metrics. It still gives a lot of information at a single glance.\n\nThis is what it looks like:\n\n\n\nYou can use VTrend in TradingView’s free tier as well - make an account if you don’t have one.\n\nVTrend is a premium script that costs 420 USD per year with shill link.\n\nI’ll first go over the elements you see on the VTrend chart and then make an example of how to read and interpret that.\n\nVolume-weighted bands for support and resistance\n\nThe first feature you’ll notice are the volume-weighted bands - the blue and red bands that look a bit like Ichimoku cloud.\n\nReading the bands is similar to reading moving averages in the fast vs slow chart setup: You look for crossovers. When the faster blue band crosses below the slower red band, it confirms the market is in a downtrend.\n\nThe VTrend bands are volume-weighted, but the crossovers it shows are not far from what you get with 50/200 EMA/SMA crossover. (I used this script from the free library.)\n\n\n\nAnd then, they come with an upper and lower boundary. Premium TradingView scripts don’t usually open the script’s pine code for viewing so I am just guessing here like the rest of you.\n\nThe areas of the bands mark the key zones where the market might reverse or stop to make a range, especially when you combine that information with other support and resistance charting tools, or with tools like a volume profile.\n\nOn long timeframes like the weekly, the volume-weighted bands give a single glance overview of where the market is at.\n\nThat’s all just like an MA, except VTrend paints a range rather than a line. It’s easier to work with visually and can give you a small advantage.\n\nPrice-based data for psychological turning points\n\nIn addition to volume data, the script paints daily, weekly, monthly and yearly open price into your chart.\n\nOn long timeframes, this is a valuable tool because milestone open prices can form a psychological boundary that turns into a support or resistance zone.\n\nThe idea behind this is a simplification of the concept of market profile. In market profile theory, you chart a volume profile for each trading day. Then you take a look at what the market does around the level with highest traded volume: Does it bounce away from that level or does it blast through? This says a lot about the market sentiment even when the price changes relatively a little.\n\nOn daily and weekly charts, you can look at monthly and yearly opens in addition to volume data.\n\nHere’s an example from 2021 and 2022. In 2021, the yearly open of ~29000 USD acted as a support on multiple occasions and eventually, BTC made an all-time-high from there. In 2022 however, the market failed to stay above the yearly open of ~46000 USD.\n\n\n\nI also looked at shorter time frames, overlaying VTrend on a 30M chart with a daily fix-range volume profile (I used this script from the free library).\n\n\n\nThat the daily opens (orange lines) under the market conditions of October 2022 are at about the same level as the daily volume point of control (teal line, the peak of each day’s volume profile).\n\nThat shows that the market isn’t trending.\n\nCharting the daily opens together with the volume points of control can be a good addition to your setup for trend analysis.\n\nTrend reversals and the entry signals\n\nThe last set of VTrend features are the reversals and the entry points.\n\nThey are all black box - you won’t get to see on which logic they are based and there is no way to figure it out, they’re just points on the chart.\n\nYou can automate your trading based on them though. Paid TradingView plans support webhooks that can integrate with your trading bot or with a bot platform like Coinrule.\n\nThe author of the VTrend strategy backtested a few setups on forex markets, ETHUSD and BTCUSD chart in early 2022.\n\nMore backtesting results on vtrendscript.com/#results but generally the trades in the backtest risked 500 USD per trade starting with 5000 USD balance, had a 3% stop and would let the profits run.\n\nIn the backtest each trade ran with a trailing stop until it got stopped out either in loss or in profit. That’s a pretty good method. Starting ratio was 1.5 reward to 1 risk.\n\nThis setup gave very high PnLs in crypto and much lower in forex, from which I would guess a part of those high profits was letting the winning trades run while crypto was trending.\n\nYou will probably not hit such a high PnL in ranging market conditions. Get the free trial and test it yourself, though.\n\nHere’s crypto backtest:\n\n\n\nVTrend backtest: BTCUSD on 25m, 58 trades in total, 500 USD out of initial 5000 USD per trade.\n\nAnd here’s forex:\n\n\n\nVTrend backtest: USDCAD on 1h, 74 trades in total, 500 USD out of initial 5000 USD per trade.\n\nTrend reversals (Exit signals)\n\nThe diamond dots painted in VTrend chart mark trend reversal signals. The author recommends using them as a signal to mark the exit areas. You might still let you trade run but with a tighter stop, for instance.\n\nBy looking at the longer time frames, the reversal signals might work with volume. At the 2021 weekly chart, the reversal is signalled at the 45k USD level in early January.\n\nSee the yellow diamond there:\n\n\n\nThat was the early high-volume peak that due to market psychology and greed usually proceeds to run away further up on lower volume.\n\nOn shorter timeframes they tend to be more accurate.\n\nEntry signals\n\nThe round dots on the chart are entry signals. The different colours separate trades with or against trends and different levels of riskiness. These are the entry signals used in the author’s backtest.\n\nThe author says that the script generates the signals based on volume and momentum criteria, but uses additional filters to remove false positives.\n\n\n  The red and green circles signal that the price is just about to break downwards or upwards respectively. These signals passed all filters and are less risky to take.\n  The purple and orange circles signal a position you’d be taking against the trend.\n  The olive circles are risky trades where you’d be taking a position against the trend.\n\n\nI had to adjust some of these in settings, I didn’t like the default settings where it’s all circles.\n\n\n\nI changed the colours of the diamonds because I use a dark chart layout. Then I changed the shapes of the entry signals. There’s a ton of them, they are painted above or below the price action to suggest the direction but changing the shapes still ends up working better for me.\n\nChanging the olive signals to triangles of a respective direction helped me read the chart much easier.\n\nI also changed the signals that are against the trend to squares.\n\n\n\nHere’s my settings:\n\n\n\nWhat I thought\n\nI did not run a backtest but following the entry signals, the sell signals are consistently painted quite late: Compare the red dots and the green dots between 30M, 4H and 1D.\n\nThis shows that the script will perform better in a bull than in a bear, the short positions will not be entered soon enough.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, taking the riskier signals on shorter timeframes with a tight stop might still make good results, as long as you can trade cheap. It will make you trade a lot of chop so you need cheap trading to make small wins still profitable after fees.\n\nAs for charting and manual trading, I liked it a lot. I think the VTrend script makes reading the chart easier and saves time on that if you like working with indicators that have roughly the format of the Ichimoku cloud.\n\nVTrend is based on different market metrics, has vastly more functions and gives more and clearer signals; however, it still has the single-glance look of Ichimoku. I got used to working with it pretty fast.\n\nVolume-aware traders who have the eye for it and trade occasionally enough to not be burnt out from staring at charts would have mostly spotted these signals without the script as well.\n\nBut that’s the thing, VTrend has that all done for you and painted on the chart.\n\nThe cost is 420 USD per year, or 50 USD monthly, and it’s a single script. TradingView’s FREE plan that caps you at 3 indicators per chart.\n\n\n  Get VTrend here\n  Get a TradingView Free account\n\n",

      title: "Microsoft Power BI: Can it be used to analyze crypto data?",
      content: "Power BI is a reporting tool made by Microsoft. It is geared towards businesses and provides tools like customizable dashboards, interactive visualizations or business intelligence. The interface was designed with simplicity in mind, so it’s easy enough even for new users to create their own reports.\n\nIf you do any type of business that handles any type of monetary transaction on a large scale – traditional business, trading stocks, trading cryptocurrencies, or keeping track of your winnings and other information of your winning from playing Grande Vegas online casino – there will be lot of data to go through every month.\n\nThe data needs to be stored, and the data needs to be analyzed. In this aspect, trading cryptocurrencies is no different from running a media agency.\n\nAs long as your business works on a small scale, then using Microsoft Excel to store and analyze the data will absolutely be enough.\n\nBut once your data reaches certain volumes, Excel will not cut it. Larger data sets need to be stored a database, for which you will need a more powerful user interface.\n\nIn that case, you may need to look into Power BI.\n\nWhat is Power BI?\n\nIn simple terms, Power BI is “Excel on steroids”.\n\nIn more sophisticated terms, Power BI is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to turn your unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights.\n\nThere are three main parts to Power BI.  The first if where the data is obtained from.  The second is the report generating of the data.  Third is the storage of the final data.\n\nHow can you plug data into Power BI?\n\nTo start working with a new set of data, the first thing you have to do is to get the data somewhere.\n\nYou can either “discover content” or you can “create new content”. Power BI supports all the common time series data sources that you can get from crypto exchanges either in your user account or programmatically via an API.\n\nSupported remote data sources:\n\n\n  File\n  Database\n  Power Platform\n  MS Azure cloud storage\n  Online Services\n  Custom implementations\n\n\nFile data sources:\n\n\n  MS Excel\n  Text\n  CSV (the typical exchange log format)\n  XML\n  JSON (the typical API endpoint format)\n  Compressed directory\n  PDF\n  Parquet (column based record text based record storage)\n  Sharepoint Folder\n\n\nSide Note: Parquet (column based data storage) is useful when you only need to work with a small amount of the data. Then you just read in the appropriate column into memory instead of the whole table into memory. This will not be useful is you are working with a dataset that has thousands of rows as the impact on memory would be too big. But if you want to analyze trading data from 50 trades, the column based data storage may make sense. This is actually a “new concept” in data storage, which is why I am making note of it.\n\nSupported Types of Databases:\n\n\n  SQL Server Database (Microsoft)\n  MS Access database\n  SQL Server Analysis Services database\n  Oracle database\n  MySQL database\n  PostgreSQL database\n  Amazon Redshift\n  Google BigQuery\n  Amazon Athena\n  BI Connector\n  MariaDB\n  SQLite\n\n\nAs you can see, Microsoft prefers their own products but still makes available plenty open source options such as MySQL, MariaDB or SQLite.\n\nIn fact, there even more different database data sources available to Power BI. I only listed a few of the most popular. Here is the Microsoft’s Power BI Documentation to get the rest.\n\nPower Platform Data Sources:\n\n\n  Power BI Datasets\n  Datamarts (preview)\n  Dataverse\n  Power Platforms Dataflows\n\n\nAzure Data Sources (Microsoft):\n\n\n  Azure SQL Database\n  Azure Database for PostgreSQL\n  Azure Blob Storage (storing data in binary format)\n  Azure Table Storage\n\n\nAll of the different Azure data sources are supported, but I did not list them all.  Azure is owned by Microsoft, so it would make sense that Microsoft Power BI would support all Azure options.\n\nOnline Services Data Sources:\n\n\n  SharePoint Online List\n  Microsoft Exchange Online\n  Dynamics 365 (Dataverse)\n  Dynamics NAV\n  Dynamics 365 Business Central\n  Azure DevOps (Boards only)\n  Azure DevOps Server (Boards only)\n  Salesforce Objects\n  Salesforce Reports\n  Google Analytics\n  Adobe Analytics\n  appFigures (Beta)\n  Data.World - Get Dataset (Beta)\n  GitHub (Beta)\n  LinkedIn Sales Navigator (Beta)\n  Marketo (Beta)\n  Mixpanel (Beta)\n  Planview Enterprise One - PRM (Beta)\n  QuickBooks Online (Beta)\n  Smartsheet\n  SparkPost (Beta)\n  SweetIQ (Beta)\n  Planview Enterprise One - CTM (Beta)\n  Zendesk (Beta)\n  Asana (Beta)\n  Assemble Views\n  Automation Anywhere\n  Automy Data Analytics (Beta)\n  Dynamics 365 Customer Insights (Beta)\n  Emigo Data Source\n  Entersoft Business Suite (Beta)\n  eWay-CRM\n  FactSet Analytics\n  Palantir Foundry\n  Funnel\n  Hexagon PPM Smart API\n  Industrial App Store\n  Intune Data Warehouse (Beta)\n  Projectplace for Power BI\n  Product Insights (Beta)\n  Profisee (Beta)\n  Quick Base\n  SoftOne BI (Beta)\n  Spigit (Beta)\n  TeamDesk (Beta)\n  Webtrends Analytics (Beta)\n  Witivio (Beta)\n  Viva Insights\n  Zoho Creator (Beta)\n\n\nThe reason that I listed all of them, instead of just the major ones,  is to indicate just how vesitile Power BI is.  Not even included traditional data flat files and traditional SQL database, Power BI can get data from 49 different online services.  And these are not even the “other” data sources that are in the next category.\n\n\n  Web\n  SharePoint list\n  OData Feed\n  Active Directory\n  Microsoft Exchange\n  Hadoop File (HDFS)\n  Spark\n  Hive LLAP\n  R script\n  Python script\n  ODBC\n  OLE DB\n  Acterys : Model Automation &amp; Planning (Beta)\n  Amazon OpenSearch Service (Beta)\n  Anaplan Connector Autodesk Construction Cloud (Beta)\n  Solver\n  BitSight Security Ratings\n  BQE Core\n  Bloomberg Data and Analytics\n  Cherwell (Beta)\n  Cognite Data Fusion\n  Delta Sharing\n  Eduframe (Beta)\n  EQuIS (Beta)\n  FactSet RMS (Beta)\n  FHIR\n  Google Sheets (Beta)\n  Information Grid (Beta)\n  Jamf Pro (Beta)\n  Kognitwin\n  MicroStrategy for Power BI\n  OpenSearch Project (Beta)\n  Paxata\n  QubolePresto (Beta)\n  Roamler (Beta)\n  SIS-CC SDMX (Beta)\n  Shortcuts Business Insights (Beta)\n  Siteimprove\n  Starburst Enterprise\n  SumTotal\n  SurveyMonkey (Beta)\n  Microsoft Teams Personal Analytics (Beta)\n  Tenforce (Smart)List\n  Usercube (Beta)\n  Vena\n  Vessel Insight\n  Zucchetti HR Infinity (Beta)\n  Blank Query\n\n\nSummary of all of the places to get data into Power BI\n\nMaybe it is because I was a software engineer, and my first job out of college was exporting data from one database system and importing it into “my company’s” database system (database written by my employer).  I look at that list and I am in awe.  I wrote the source code from scratch that can now be done in Power BI with just a few clicks of a button.\n\nBut even then, I was dealing with one data source.  Power BI can handle an infinite number of data sources of different data types, and when you are finished importing into Power BI, what the user sees on the screen is just the data that they want to see.  It does not matter that the name of the state came from Wikipedia and the number of births and deaths and population comes from the US Census Reports.  It is just data to the end user.\n\nAnd then you start defining the relationships of that data.  When I was doing that way back, I had to write code by hand.  Every new dataset was a new subprogram that had to be compiled and tested and documented.  But now, with Power BI … it is just a few clicks of the button.  The data dictionaries and data mapping and data flow diagrams that I used to have to draw by hand in the past, I just use Power BI templates and arrows (no different than drawing in Visio and Microsoft Word), I connect the data (draw the data relations) in Power BI … click done, and behind the scenes, Power BI does everything that I once had to do “by hand” with custom made code.\n\nDid I mention just how awestruck I am with Power BI and I have not even begun to talk about Power BI’s data analysis, report generation, and saving / exporting the final data, including creating data panels / data dashboards that update automatically as you update your data in Power BI.\n\nI know that the Israeli government used Power BI to display their data on their public website during the COVID-19 pandemic, and I am sure that they were not the only ones.\n",

      title: "Crypto Casinos: Why Does It Make Sense To Pay For Entertainment In Crypto",
      content: "The last decade or so has seen crypto send ripples through industry after industry, accelerating in the last five.\n\nIt is true that in many cases, the disruption was short-lived and only meant to generate buzz. But not always: Crypto has helped to break ground, for instance, enabling contemporary African artists to have work auctioned at Christie’s of London for the first time in history.\n\nThe concept of digital ownership is a foundational feature not only of Bitcoin or NFT art, but also of projects like the Ethereum Name Service or ENS, which aims to replace the more centralized infrastructure that tends to underpin DNS.\n\nAfter thousands of alts, DeFi and NFTs, crypto’s killer app are still cross-border payments\n\nAll of these examples illustrate how key a part crypto can play in the realization of the potential that the Internet was supposed to promise; to connect the world in meaningful, distributed ways.\n\nBut IT idealists are not the only ones who have long envisioned the erosion of geography-bound regulation holding the world in place.\n\nOne of the long-posited core benefits of cryptocurrency is that widespread adoption of crypto as means of exchange could do away with cross-border transfer hitches. And the erosion of geographic boundaries is something that crypto is pushing in the online casino space, as well.\n\nCrypto casinos are exactly what they sound like: online casinos where cryptoassets like Bitcoin are used instead of fiat currency.\n\nThe space has moved fast. One piece on Cryptonews describes an ascent from the simple dice game Satoshidice to much slicker implementations, and recent reports claim that 150 crypto casinos are opening per year.\n\nSo what accounts for this popularity, and how are they different from traditional online casinos?\n\n\n  \n    Transparency\n\n    So long as players stick to reputable online casinos, they shouldn’t find it impossible to win.\n\n    Blockchain casinos score a bit better here. As Hackernoon explains, crypto casinos — usually living on Ethereum blockchain — have a pre-programmed payout rate that can be read in the open code.\n\n    And because the wagers all take place on-chain without an intermediary, they can be checked and verified too, which many hail as an advantage over standard online casinos.\n  \n  \n    Range of Games\n\n    Online entertainment as a whole is a huge and well-established industry. Consequently, your typical online casino has a wide variety of content. This includes different game types as well as themes. Case in point; Gala Bingo Slingo titles include Slingo Stampede and Slingo X Factor, two different themes around a unique genre. Elsewhere, the same provider has game shows, live casino games, poker and more. This is the typical offering.\n\n    But you may find a crypto casino doesn’t have the same depth. The fact is that despite its popularity, crypto gambling is still only one segment of the wider industry, and with fewer players, it makes sense not to have such an expansive selection of options at this time.\n\n    That may yet change, however - especially if crypto entertainment becomes more popular.\n  \n  \n    Anonymity and Crossing Borders\n\n    There are plenty reasons why someone might want to use an anonymous wallet at a casino rather than a bank account.\n\n    Some are shady. The reality is that there are legal restrictions in many countriesaround the world  that people try to circumvent. There will be plenty of wagers on the FIFA World Cup in Qatar, for instance, though none of them can be made from within the country itself.\n\n    Tough regulations came down on iGaming in the US during the George W. Bush administration, too, with slow state-by-state legalization during the last decade. If a player is used to legal wagers in Connecticut but moves just over the border to Rhode Island, it is understandable, albeit illegal, to try to continue.\n\n    Like it or not, crypto makes and opening for that. In this sense, to reasonable regulators, crypto could be making a case for iGaming in general to be legal across borders rather than pushing it underground, 1930s prohibition-style.\n\n    Then there are good reasons, too, though. Some people just don’t want casinos to appear on their bank statements, often for privacy or even, for instance, to avoid any unwanted impact on their credit rating. While there are startups that collect credit rating data on blockchain as well, pairing a BTC address with a real world identity is much more difficult in crypto than in a bank.\n  \n\n\nFinal words\n\nTo wrap it up, let’s admin that crypto casinos are evolving into a mainstay within the wider industry. BTC and ETH predominate because of their network effect and reputation, of course, but many crypto-first shops run on their own tokens. It remains to be seen which of these two models will be most popular in years to come.\n",

      title: "Financing 101: What Is a Cash Advance and when should you use it?",
      content: "Most of us will face difficult financial shortage at some point in our trading and our lives, that’s the reality.\n\nWhen this happens, it’s not always clear where to turn for assistance. In some cases, though, a cash advance may be the best alternative since it is faster and simpler to receive than most other options.\n\nDepending on the specifics of the situation, you may not have the time to go for other sources of funds that require more time and documentation. Also, in some situations that would simply not pay off - you know will get more liquidity soon enough anyway and waiting would make you lose the opportunity.\n\nBe aware though that despite their benefits, cash advances may have considerable disadvantages. As a result, it’s critical to understand what cash advances are and how much they might cost you.\n\nWhat Exactly Are Cash Advances?\n\nA cash advance is a short-term loan that delivers you cash, expecting that you will be able to repay the debt very soon. They are often handy in the short term through the best cash advance app, for example, but they may all be pricey in terms of fees and rates over time.\n\nTo answer the question “what are cash advances?” more exactly is difficult since they may take several shapes. Credit card cash advances, payday loans, and small business loans are all frequent possibilities. Each of them works in a slightly different manner.\n\nHow do cash advances work?\n\nIn simple terms, a cash advance is a loan obtained by utilizing the available amount on your credit card. Instead of using your credit card to purchase a product or service, you are borrowing cash against your credit limit.\n\nCredit card issuers, however, do not consider these two sorts of purchases equally. That’s why you should not jump into a cash advance carelessly.\n\n\n  \n    Grace period\n\n    If you use your credit card to purchase an item or service, the credit card company will charge you the purchase interest rate mentioned in your contract\n\n    That is commonly labeled as the purchase APR, or annual percentage rate. And, if your credit card has a grace period, you won’t be charged interest on that transaction until your payment is due.\n\n    That means you may never have to pay interest on your purchases if your card has a grace period and you pay your balance in whole and on time each month.\n  \n  \n    Extra fees\n\n    Cash advances, on the other hand, often do not have grace periods. As soon as you withdraw the advance amount, interest will start to accrue on it.\n\n    Additionally, your credit card company will almost definitely charge you a processing fee and a higher interest rate for cash advances than it does for ordinary transactions.\n  \n\n\nCash Advance Varieties\n\n\n  \n    Cash Advances on Credit Cards\n\n    A credit card cash advance is a function that many credit cards provide. Essentially a short-term loan, the borrower may access cash or a cash equivalent up to 20% or 30% of the card’s authorized credit limit. You may withdraw up to 50% of your available credit limit on certain credit cards.\n  \n  \n    Cash Advances from Merchants and OTC providers\n\n    Merchant cash advances allow companies to get the financing they need. Merchant cash advances are calculated based on historical sales or future sales predictions. This is analogous to the necessity for a pay stub for payday loans.\n\n    Cash advances are a reasonable and simple option for small businesses to get the funds they need for their operating expenses, the whole procedure frequently takes just a few days or less.\n\n    Similarly, you may get a cash advance option for your bulk crypto purchases with some of the independent OTC platforms. It is not a standard option however, not every OTC trader will get a cash advance approved.\n  \n  \n    Payday Advances\n\n    Payday loans are another short-term option that is quite infamous and for good reasons.\n\n    They provide you with the ability to borrow money from your firm in the future. Most payday lenders will request evidence of income, such as a prior pay stub. Funds may be accessible both physically and digitally.\n\n    Payday loans, as opposed to cash advances, may be exceedingly predatory and should be avoided.\n  \n\n\n\n\nFees and Costs\n\nIf you are considering a cash advance, there are the fees to consider. The fees might be quite substantial depending on the conditions of the advance. As a result, before obtaining one, you should be informed of all of the repercussions.\n\nThe APR for credit card cash advances, for example, may be greater than the APR for balance transfers and purchases. Then, in addition to the increased APR, you’ll have to pay a cash advance processing charge.\n\nIn general, cash advance costs usually are 3% to 5% of the amount borrowed. Thus, a $500 cash advance would incur a cost of $15 to $25 on average.\n\nFor a business or a trader with a strategy, that surcharge still might pay off, if they repay the loan soon.\n\nThe Benefits and Drawbacks of Cash Advances\n\nBenefits\n\n\n  No collateral is needed for instant access to unsecured money;\n  No underwriting or credit checks are necessary, making it simple to get.\n\n\nDrawbacks\n\n\n  APR and fees that are quite high;\n  There is no grace period—credit card cash advances begin charging interest on the first day.\n\n\nDo Cash Advances Ruin Your Credit?\n\nA cash advance has no direct influence on your credit or credit score, but it may have an indirect impact in a variety of ways.\n\nThe catch with these loans in the USA is that the loan interest rates vary greatly by state. Aside from states that have outright forbidden payday lending, several have imposed rate limitations on short-term loans. Consumers in states without such limitations, on the other hand, may find up paying through the roof. Payday loan data by state reveal that Texas, Utah, and Idaho (652%-664%), as well as Mississippi, North Dakota, and Montana, have usually high APRs.\n\nA cash advance often has a hefty interest rate. Your credit score may suffer if you are unable to pay your obligations. Furthermore, if the cash advance exceeds the credit limit on your card, your credit score may suffer. Even if the debt is paid down, your credit report will reflect the highest reported balance, and other prospective lenders will see that you were above the limit at one time, which may affect your ability to get new credit.\n\nWhen You Should Consider Getting a Cash Advance\n\nIf you truly need money for a low-risk expense that will generate money, a cash advance might be a good and speedy method to get it. However, the following actions may be beneficial:\n\n\n  Check your account conditions to find out the APR for cash advances, as well as any additional fees that may apply;\n  Borrow as little as possible and pay it off as quickly as you can.\n\n\nFinal words\n\nWhen used seldom and with good reason, cash advances are not problematic. They are just a short-term solutions to address exigencies. If you find that you often need a cash loan to cover your operating costs, budgeting adjustments and money management are the real solution.\n",

      title: "What Kind Of Features Should You Look For In A Good Crypto Wallet?",
      content: "When it comes to cryptocurrency, security is of the utmost importance. If you are going to be investing in digital currencies, then you really should make sure that you are doing so through a wallet that you can trust.\n\nThere are a few different kinds of crypto wallets available on the market: Hardware wallets, software wallets, hosted wallets to name a few.\n\nNot all of them offer the same features. In this blog post, we will discuss the features that you should expect from a good unhosted crypto wallet. We will also provide some tips on how to choose a wallet that is right for you!\n\n\n  \n    How do unhosted crypto wallets work and what are their benefits over hosted wallets?\n\n    To put it simply, an unhosted cryptocurrency wallet is a digital wallet that can be used to store, send and receive digital currencies by any individual, privately, without signing up for an account anywhere.\n\n    The equivalent of unhosted storage in traditional banking would be keeping your money in cash. But unlike traditional finance, crypto is not centralized and therefore unhosted storage does not prevent you from accessing advanced financial services such as lending or investing (at least not technically).\n\n    Some of the benefits of using a crypto wallet include:\n\n    \n      More control over your funds: With a traditional bank account, you are at the mercy of the bank’s policies. With an unhosted crypto wallet, you are in control of your own funds.\n      Increased security: Crypto wallets are in some ways more secure than traditional banking methods. With a traditional bank account, your money is stored with a third party that speculates with your money. The profit of that speculation makes a large part of the profit of banking institutions. With a crypto wallet, your money is stored in a decentralized location that nobody except you can access unless you give away your private key.\n      Privacy: Traditional banking methods do not offer the same level of privacy as crypto wallets. With a traditional bank account, your personal information is stored in a central database along with your transaction history. With a crypto wallet, your transaction history is public but it is extremely difficult to link it to your personally identifiable information.\n    \n\n    \n\n    Of course, there are also some disadvantages to using a crypto wallet. For example,\n\n    \n      They can be difficult to use: Crypto wallets can be difficult to set up and use for people who are not too tech-savvy.\n      They are not insured: Unlike traditional bank accounts, crypto wallets are not insured by the government. Some crypto trading platforms have private insurance for customer funds, but unhosted wallets cannot get insured. This means that if you lose your money, there is no guarantee that you will be able to get it back.\n    \n  \n  \n    What should you look for when choosing a self-hosted crypto wallet?\n\n    As you narrow down your choices for a crypto wallet brand, here are key factors to consider:\n\n    \n      Ease of use. The best crypto wallets are user friendly. It should come easy to you to understand how to get started without reading much of the documentation. At the same time, they should provide clear documentation and FAQs in case users need assistance.\n      Security features. Good software wallets offer a variety of security features, such as two-factor authentication, biometric login for devices that support it, and hardware wallet support. Supporting basic security measures such as setting up a strong password goes without saying.\n      Supported currencies. There are Web3 wallets like MetaMask that let you import any currency on any blockchain network, but not all software wallets work like that. Most wallets have a predefined set of currencies. Make sure that the wallet you choose supports the cryptocurrencies you want to trade in.\n      Customer service. In case you have any problems with your wallet, it’s good to know that there is someone you can contact for help. Even software wallets that are available for free should be available for tagging or messaging on Twitter or have their own customer support system.\n      Transparency and fees. Some wallets are more transparent than others about the fees they let you pay when you transact. It’s also important to find out if there are pre-set standard transaction fees that you get charged and whether you can customise the fee settings.\n    \n  \n  \n    What features can you realistically expect from a good crypto wallet in terms of security and user-friendliness?\n\n    If you’re looking for a good crypto wallet, you should expect features like security, ease of use, and customer support. Here’s a closer look at each of these features:\n\n    Security is important in any wallet, but it’s especially important in a crypto wallet. After all, you’re dealing with sensitive information like your private keys. A good crypto wallet will have features like two-factor authentication and multi-sig support to help keep your funds safe.\n\n    Ease of use is another important feature to look for in a crypto wallet. After all, you don’t want to spend hours trying to figure out how to use your wallet. Look for a wallet with a clean interface and easy-to-understand instructions.\n\n    Customer support is the last feature to consider when choosing a crypto wallet. After all, you want to be able to get help if you have any problems with your wallet. Look for a wallet that offers 24/seven customer support in case you run into any issues.\n\n    Also, you can just take a look at some crypto wallet reviews. For instance, you can easily find an Exodus wallet review, or a Jaxx wallet review online. These can help you get an idea of what other people are saying about different wallets.\n  \n\n\nIn the end, these are some of the features that you should expect from a good crypto wallet. Of course, there are many other wallets out there with different features. It is up to you to decide which one suits your needs the best.\n\nThe most important thing is that you find a wallet that you are comfortable using on the daily and that will keep your coins safe.\n",

      title: "Staking Wallets: Your Guide to Staking Crypto for September 2022",
      content: "Cold Staking Crypto - Updates for September 2022\n\nWelcome to the September 2022 update of the staking wallets guide. This is where we are keeping eye on the time-tested, reliable, independent crypto wallets for cold staking of Proof-of-Stake cryptocurrencies. We also mention the three top crypto exchanges that will let you stake through their wallets or locked staking programs, though always for a hefty fee.\n\nLedger in September 2022 launched a new offer for the ETH Merge. Since 15 Sep, ETH holders can buy a bundle of Ledger Nano X and Billfodl at an additional 20% off. The deal is a special 20% off coupon that gets unlocked via an ETH address that you have to own. Ledger says they process the address but do not store it.\n\nBillfodl is the US-based manufacturer of stainless steel metal storage for wallet seed phrase. Other than when sold via ledger.com, Billfodls ship from the US so this bundle might also save you duty charges if you are outside of US.\n\nThe list of staking coins supported by Ledger is available at Ledger’s website here.\n\nExodus wallet in September 2022 released a couple of updates. The Web3 version of Exodus, which in non-buzz speak is known as the Chrome extension, added the support of Algorand. All ALGO tokens are supported. Also, Exodus made it easy to use the Web3 wallet to access DeFi protocols like Algofi, trade and mint NFTs on AlgoSeas, use the Tinyman token swap, or participate in Governance. Other than ALGO, the Web3 version of Exodus supports ETH and SOL, with all their tokens.\n\nThe desktop Exodus app wallet released its 22.9.8 version in mid September with new features not directly related to staking. They added support for customizable pet Aavegotchis and full support for the following tokens: SYN (ETH), STG (ETH), GMX (AVAX), and GHST (Polygon).\n\nCold staking rates on Exodus app wallet increased a tiny bit for Solana but generally keep stable, as on the linked screenshot.\n\nFor staking of low-cap coins in September 2022, your best option are still staking pools, at least if you want to avoid the 20% service fee that centralised exchanges take. Jump to list of pool guides for niche alt coins like KAVA.\n\nSome low-cap staking coins can be staked at better rates in “launch pool” promo events on centralized exchanges. Launch pools are time limited staking events for new coins, exchanges use these events to test the popularity of these alts.\n\nOut of KYC exchanges, Binance.com runs them and so does CEX.io occasionally. For no-KYC version of the same product go to Phemex.\n\nPhemex specifically runs an earn promo almost every week, as is always reported in our exchange promo feed.\n\nAs a note, launch pool staking is a black box, your money is at a higher risk than in cold staking.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nIn the rest of the article we cover:\n\n\n  What is cold staking and what are the risks\n  Best Staking Wallets\n    \n      Staking on Exodus wallet\n      Staking on Trezor wallet\n      Staking on Ledger wallet\n      A few comments on KYC’d staking wallets like Trustwallet that blocked some of y’all due to geopolitics\n    \n  \n  Best Exchanges to stake crypto\n    \n      Staking on Bitfinex\n      Staking on Binance\n      Staking on FTX\n      We cover dedicated staking platforms for big holders in a separate post\n    \n  \n\n\nWhat is staking crypto?\n\nCrypto staking is a way to earn income by holding a certain kind of cryptocurrencies in your own crypto wallet, or on a crypto exchange that supports staking yield.\n\nThis guide is for cryptocurrency wallets for cold staking, or network staking. Only cryptocurrencies running on an algorithm called PoS, or proof-of-stake, are can yield this kind of staking income. In these blockchains, staking is the mechanism that replaces mining in securing the ledger and verifying new transactions.\n\n\n  Best cold staking currencies in 2022 are SOL, ADA, XTZ or TRX out of the big ones, and then any number of low-cap cryptocurrencies including some of the big name dog money like SHIB.\n\n\nAs a note: The DeFi community sometimes uses the term staking for liquidity provision. DeFi staking is a different activity and is done from different platforms - more here.\n\nWhat are the risks of staking crypto?\n\nStaking income is not risk-free, but typically the risk of cold staking is lower when compared to trading crypto as well as when compared to DeFi staking (yield from liquidity provision).\n\nAs long as you use an unhosted staking wallet like Ledger or Exodus instead of staking from an exchange, you still fully own your coins, because you own the private keys to your wallet. Staked coins only get delegated for staking. Delegated funds cannot be lost or stolen.\n\nSome of the security and financial risks you can run into when staking crypto:\n\n\n  Bad validator: You stake a coin via delegating to a validator, and the validator decides to not pay you. (This is rare)\n  Wallet breach: Your staking wallet or exchange account gets hacked. (Rare if you take precautions)\n  Volatility: A fundamental event changes the valuation of your PoS crypto and you will not be able to sell it, due to having coins locked up in staking. (Yeah this happens)\n\n\nIf you decide to stake via a custodial exchange like Binance, you will need to deposit your alt coins to that exchange and the exchange will stake them for you.\n\nThis exposes you to the additional risk of loss through a security breach: Somebody can hack your account or the exchange as a whole.\n\nSo, the least risky staking coins are those that offer high yield and are available for staking from un-hosted wallets (Ledger, Trezor, Exodus…). If you want to really make it super low risk, the staking coin should pay staking yield directly from the network, so that there is no need for validators, but practically this is a bit of an overkill.\n\n\n  Staking coins that pay out directly: Komodo, NEO.\n  Staking coins that you need to delegate to a validator node: ETH2, Tron, Tezos, Polkadot.\n\n\n\n\nStaking crypto from a crypto wallet\n\nDesktop wallet apps that offer staking have the best combination of benefits. It is easy to stake crypto through a wallet, the risks are lower than when staking on an exchange, and the yield it gives is higher than when staking on an exchange.\n\nIt is not technically demanding to start staking from a crypto wallet. Right now, the yields are typically higher than what you get from margin lending.\n\nMarket inefficiencies happen, but this is the rule: You will not get 0.015% daily rate consistently to make those 5% p.a in margin lending these days. But 5% APY is just about the typical rate for cold staking of big-ish coins in a bull market.\n\nAnd then, staking rates will typically be better in a wallet than in staking through exchanges, because exchanges do charge fees. To give you an idea, Coinbase charges a whopping 25% fee on your staking reward as per their ToS. The other popular staking exchanges - Binance, Bitfinex, FTX - do not disclose their staking fee, they only state they charge some fee.\n\nBest Wallets for Staking\n\nThe most popular staking wallet globally is still the Binance-owned Trust Wallet. The popularity of Trust Wallet is given by the fact that it’s one of the few places that let you stake BNB coins.\n\nBut since Trust Wallet is owned by Binance, and Binance bans certain geo-locations, you may not be able to trade or stake certain cryptocurrencies. And that is exactly the reson why AltcoinTrading.NET always advocates smaller, independent wallets.\n\n\n  If you’re one of those who got “BNB not available” in Trust Wallet, then you need to start trading and staking BNB without Binance. (It’s possible!)\n\n\nHere’s the top of the market among independent crypto staking wallets:\n\n\n  Staking on Exodus wallet\n  Staking on Trezor wallet\n  Staking on Ledger wallet\n\n\nStaking on Exodus Wallet\n\n\n\nCrypto staking rates fluctuate. Exodus staking yields shown above were retrieved on Sep 15, 2022.\n\nStaking cryptos supported by Exodus: Solana SOL, Tezos XTZ,  Cardano ADA,  Algorand ALGO, Cosmos ATOM, Ontology ONT, VeChain VEC / VeThor VTHO. Exodus does not support BNB staking.\n\nExodus is the most popular free and independent crypto wallet app. It supports over 100 currencies and is available for Android, iPhone and as a desktop app. Exodus wallet staking is available on all of these versions of the wallet.\n\nThe focus of Exodus wallets is on sleek user interface that makes high-tech functions accessible to everyone. For instance, this is all you need to click to stake ALGO from your Exodus mobile app:\n\n\n\nIs Exodus trustworthy?\n\nOh yes. Exodus has been around for a long time. They earn fees from the instant exchange that comes with Exodus wallets and that keeps them independent from industry behemoths.\n\nThey are known as pioneers and integrate new features very quickly. For instance, they rolled out a graphic NFT gallery for the Solana blockchain recently.\n\nYou cannot do anything too technically advanced with Exodus, such as signing a message with an address. But it is the best choice for you if you are a regular crypto holder who just wants to cold-stake crypto with great rates, good security and minimum hassle.\n\nHow to stake crypto on Exodus\n\n\n  Install the Exodus wallet for desktop from exodus.com or get the mobile app from your app store.\n  Click the “+” symbol in the top navigation (on the right). This will take you to the list of wallet apps to install.\n  Select the app called “Rewards” and install it.\n  Click the newly added “Rewards” button in the top navigation bar.\n  Rewards app lists out all the current staking rates, recalculated as yearly.\n  Choose the coin that yu want to stake and click “Start earning”\n  The detail page will have all the detailed information on what the minimum balance is, whether you need to claim the reward and if there is any fee.\n  If you do not have any balance of that staking coin, Exodus lets you exchange it directly in your wallet for any crypto that you own. Or you can log into your FTX account directly from Exodus and buy some there with lower fee.\n\n\nHere is the official full walkthrough for how to start staking ADA in Exodus wallet:\n\n\n\n\nA couple of notes for new Exodus wallet users:\n\n  Exodus wallet is free, because it is only a software. You need to run it from a phone or a laptop…\n  …So, always make sure your crypto staking computer is clean and malware-free.\n  If you stake, trade and accept crypto payments, split your Exodus wallet into portfolios - one for each purpose. Here’s how to do it - it’s really easy.\n\n\nStaking on Ledger Wallet\n\nCrypto staking is enabled in the Ledger Live app for any Ledger wallet model - Ledger Nano S, Ledger Nano X and the new Ledger Nano S Plus.\n\nStaking cryptocurrencies supported by Ledger:\n\n\n  Ethereum (ETH2),\n  Polkadot (DOT),\n  EOS (EOS),\n  Tezos (XTZ),\n  Cardano (ADA),\n  Tron (TRX),\n  Neo (NEO),\n  Cronos (CRO),\n  Nem (XEM),\n  Cosmos (ATOM),\n  Terra (LUNA),\n  Internet Computer (ICP),\n  Elrond (EGLD),\n  Algorand (ALGO).\n\n\nWhich Ledger wallet model should you get? If you are going to get a Ledger wallet for staking of more than one cryptocurrency, get either the Ledger Nano X or the new Ledger Nano S Plus. These two models enough more capacity to run multiple wallet apps at the same time.\n\nIs Ledger a good wallet for staking?\n\nYeah, Ledger is a good choice of wallet for staking for a small holder. It is easy to use staking pools if your coins are on Ledger and it is easy to stake directly from your wallet as well.\n\nBut Ledger is also good for large holders because it’s easy to run your own validator from a Ledger wallet: Everyone in the crypto staking business will always provide setup guides for the Ledger wallet, just because it is so damn popular.\n\nAnd then the whole security aspect. Ledger’s security is better than that of a software wallet. Ledger is not as super top tier as Coldcard, but it runs on a secure element chip and the wallet is isolated from whatever malware may exist on your computer.\n\nLedger Live also now comes with a crypto exchange on board. If you don’t yet have the crypto you want to stake, you can buy it there.\n\nHow to start staking on Ledger\n\nThere are different ways to generate revenue directly in Ledger by staking. What actions you need to take depends on the coin you want to stake, but most of the staking coins currently supported on Ledger will want you to delegate the coin to a validator.\n\nOn the other hand, staking is available by default in Ledger - you don’t need to install any special staking app within Ledger Live or elsewhere.\n\nHere is the official full walkthrough for how to start staking TRX in Ledger wallet:\n\n\n\nLinks to other staking tutorials available from Ledger:\n\n  How to stake SOL on Ledger\n  How to stake XTZ on Ledger\n  How to stake ATOM on Ledger\n  How to stake ALGO on Ledger\n  How to stake DOT on Ledger\n\n\n\n\nCan you stake from Ledger even if Ledger does not directly support staking of that coin?\n\nMost other PoS cryptocurrencies that are supported in Ledger wallets can be staked through a third party wallet, or through a staking pool.\n\nOften you will need to stake through a wallet specific to that staking coin, but you will be able to authenticate in it via your Ledger wallet. Then it’s just delegating your coin to the staking pool, which is basically two clicks.\n\nFor example, here is how to stake KAVA coin in the AllNodes staking pool from your Ledger wallet. Ledger does not support KAVA staking directly, but you can authenticate with your hardware wallet into the Keplr extension that you need to stake KAVA.\n\n\n\nYou can also choose to use staking pools for coins that Ledger does support directly. For illustration, here’s how to stake TRX (Tron) from Ledger wallet via AllNodes:\n\n\n\nHere are some of the coins that can be staked from Ledger through AllNodes. They all can be stored on Ledger, but not staked directly:\n\n  Stake MATIC from Ledger just by clicking “Connect” and connecting your Ledger wallet.\n  Stake XRD via Radix wallet from Ledger\n  Stake KAVA from Ledger via Keplr browser extension\n  Stake Osmosis (OSMO) from Ledger via Keplr browser extension\n  Stake Persistence (XPRT) from Ledger via Keplr browser extension\n  Fantom (FTM) can be staked from Ledger via MetaMask\n\n\nStaking on Trezor wallet\n\nAny model of Trezor wallet supports delegating coins to any staking pool or validator. Additionally, you can start staking your Trezor coins via Exodus as Trezor wallets can also use Exodus wallet as their user interface.\n\nIf you want to make use of the Exodus staking pool without holding your private key in the Exodus app, link your Trezor device to Exodus. It’s much safer that way, and you are still getting those sweet Exodus staking yields. (Jump to the section on staking at Exodus)\n\nWhich Trezor model should you choose? That’s really up to you. The Trezor T has some impressive tech inside, but for your Average Staker Joe that makes little difference. Trezor One is much cheaper and does the job too.\n\nTrezor is the second most sold crypto wallet. You can be sure that staking pools and validator hosts will always provide an easy step-by-step guide on how to delegate coins into them. Setting up pooled or dedicated staking from Trezor will not take a minute on most pools.\n\nADA Staking via delegation from Trezor T:\n\nThis is what stake key registration looks like for ADA on Trezor T:\n\n\n\nPlugging a Trezor wallet into a staking pool:\n\nHere is what ADA Trezor staking set up looks like at AllNodes:\n\n\n\nAllNodes supports easy Trezor staking of Polygon (MATIC), Cardano (ADA), Polkadot (DOT), Huobi Eco Chain, ETH2, The Graph (GRT), NEM and more. The platform also has one-click apps to set up masternodes and validators using all common alt coins via Trezor wallets.\n\n\n\nEasiest way to stake crypto: Staking on Exchanges\n\nSeveral custodial exchanges let you earn yield on PoS altcoins just by holding them on the platform. Be careful: Staking on exchanges is custodial, you send coins away from your privately owned wallet.\n\nOn Binance, FTX, Bitforex and most other platforms you need to transfer coins into a staking area on the exchange in order to stake them.\n\nBitfinex stakes your coins automatically, as long as you keep them in the exchange wallet.\n\nOther staking policies differ from one exchange to another as well:\n\n\n  Binance does not let you retrieve staked coins unless you chose flexible staking from the beginning. Rates are variable, it’s difficult to make it into the pool as they are limited.\n  Bitfinex only does flexible staking (soft-staking), your coins are never locked. You can move and trade your crypto at any time. But you’re getting a sh1t rate.\n  FTX locks your coins but lets you unstake them either within a set period for free or instantly for an extra fee. Rates are often high.\n  Kine DEX is a new DEX that is run by ex-Huobi people. Kine made it to this list because it lets you stake BNB without KYC.\n\n\nIt is not a good practice to hold crypto on an exchange. On the other hand, exchange wallet staking may realistically yield around 6% APY which may look acceptable for taking the risk that your exchange will get hacked.\n\nHowever, in Exodus or at AllNodes pool you might be getting 10% or 19% APY, so consider it well.\n\nMost popular staking pools on AllNodes:\n\n\n  Terra Luna staking pool 0% commisson\n  ADA staking pool 0% commisson\n  SOL staking pool 0% commisson\n  ETH2 Rocket Pool - NEW! 16 ETH minipool\n\n\n\n\nHow to stake crypto on Bitfinex\n\nBitfinex automatically pays staking yields for the following currencies: TRX, EOS, Tezos, Cosmos (ATOM), Algorand, Cardano, Polkadot, Ethereum 2\n\nBitfinex calls their way of staking a soft-staking program. You do not need to take any action, just deposit the supported coin into your exchange wallet on Bitfinex and leave it there.\n\nBitfinex will not lock up your funds for a certain period of time, you don’t need to delegate them either. You will simply get weekly income.\n\nHow does soft-staking on Bitfinex work?\n\nIn soft-staking, you don’t delegate coins and there is no lock. You can withdraw (or trade or lend) your coins at any moment.\n\nIn order to allow for the flexibility in platform withdrawals, soft-staking system on Bitfinex stakes only a portion of the total user pool of wallet deposits. If they did it otherwise, there wouldn’t be enough available coins available to withdraw out of the platform. And that, coupled with the fee of undisclosed size that Bitfinex takes from your staking yields, is also why the yield on Bitfinex is lower.\n\nAnother implication of the Bitfinex staking system is that while there is no minimum deposit to stake, you only get a payout if its value is over 0.5USD by the time rewards distribute every week. If your yield is lower, you lose that week’s payout to the house (who always wins /jk).\n\nShould there be an “exchange run” and too many people would want to withdraw their PoS coins, Bitfinex says they would delay withdrawals until enough coins would be available after the staking period’s end.\n\nThis is the reason why you might sometimes get an error notice on staking exchanges like Bitfinex and Binance, nagging you that there is “not enough exchange balance available” when you try to move your coins.\n\nIt’s pretty much the analog of fractional reserves in banks, except crypto is staked with low risk and fiat is put into bonds and other legacy low-risk investments.\n\nGo to staking.bitfinex.com\n\n\n\nStaking on Binance: Is it worth the hassle?\n\nBinance offers a set of yield generating products - staking, DeFi, locked savings and liquidity provision.\n\nThe platform groups together DeFi liquidity providion and cold staking, calling the first “flexible staking” and the latter “fixed staking”. Out of the two, fixed staking is the actual PoS staking where you provide coins to secure the blockchain. The flexible staking is what is otherwise known as DeFi staking - lending into the market for a yield. Binance calls it flexible because it does not lock your funds for a set period.\n\nCoins supported for cold staking on Binance: Oh, many. Fixed staking (cold staking) on Binance has limited availability. You do not always get to stake even if you own the right coin and hold it on the exchange.\n\nIn contrast to Bitfinex, on Binance you need to actively manage your holdings to get any staking income. That is certainly a drawback for crypto investors who have better things to spend their time on. On top of it, fixed staking does not let you move them until your lock is over. Additionally, the maximum yields on large-cap cryptos are way lower than even on Bitfinex.\n\nOn the other hand, Binance provides staking and DeFi yield generation for many of the low-cap staking cryptocurrencies. The supply there is smaller and so the staking yields do shoot up to 40% or more for these smaller staking alts. Also, the minimum amount you can stake on Binance is very low - usually 1 unit of the cryptocurrency. For cheaper coins like ADA that makes the barrier to starting to stake very low.\n\n\n  TLDR - Don’t use Binance to stake big crypto, but do use it to stake low-cap staking cryptocurrencies.\n\n\n\n\nStaking on FTX: Smaller selection but better rates\n\nOn FTX, you can choose to stake several cryptocurrencies for a fixed period. It is a true network staking with high yields, especially high for an exchange.\n\nThe system is quite well designed. You lock your coins and start generating income, to retrieve them you make an “unstake” order. Your staked coins will be retrieved after a grace period (~ 14 days) or instantly for an extra fee.\n\nFTX usually gives annualized staking returns between 10-20%, but the selection of coins to stake is smaller. The selection changes quite a bit over time.\n\n\n  As of May 2022, FTX Staking is only open for FTT, SOL, SRM and RAY.\n\n\n\n\nBest place to stake large amounts of crypto: Dedicated staking platforms\n\nStaking platforms run a network of nodes and pools into which small hodlers can chip in by delegating their coins from any common wallet. We have reviewed dedicated staking platforms in another post - go on here.\n\nLarge holders, or holders able to pool users, will benefit more from running their own validator node. With big providers you can spin up a validator as a one-click app and start staking pretty much in minutes, without having to download and deploy the full node yourself.\n\n\n  \n    Large holders: Masternode Hosting or Validator Node Hosting\n\n    Most providers let you deploy masternodes and validator nodes in minutes. There are automated or semi-automated setups for Ledger, Trezor and the usual single-coin wallets for that particular altcoin.\n\n    There is a monthly hosting cost and sometimes other fees. On Allnodes, the monthly fee starts at only 5 USD though.\n\n    Each coin has a (high) minimum of coins that you need to have to run a masternode or a validator. For masternodes and validators the upfront investment is significant, but your netto monthly income will typically be somewhere between 500-2000 USD.\n\n    Look around at AllNodes\n\n    \n  \n  \n    Smaller holders: Non-custodial Staking Pools\n\n    Small holders pool by delegating money from their wallets and provide additional liquidity to validators.\n\n    Some pools charge a flat fee for participation, some take a cut of the profits, but generally you will get better deals than from staking on exchanges. That’s especially for staking large-cap cryptos like ADA or ETH2.\n\n    To set up your participation, you just need to delegate coins from any wallet you’re using to the pool under its contract ID. You’ll get the exact instruction in your provider. It’s not complicated:\n\n    \n\n    Most popular staking pools on AllNodes:\n\n    \n      Terra Luna staking pool 0% commisson\n      ADA staking pool 0% commisson\n      SOL staking pool 0% commisson\n      ETH2 Rocket Pool - 16 ETH minipool\n    \n  \n\n\nSummary\n\nThere is a growing number of ways to yield staking income by securing PoS networks.\n\nIf you are not a technical person, you can choose the Exodus wallet or Bitfinex and Binance exchange to pretty much just deposit and forget.\n\nIf you are a larger holder, running your own validator will give you more revenue. The tech overhead there is lower now thanks to staking providers that automate a good part of the process.\n",

      title: "Crypto vs. Precious Metals, Looking at the Basics: Which Is the Better Investment?",
      content: "There are many highly individual factors to consider when investment planning and wealth management. One key question is what types of assets to hold to bring in stability and returns to your portfolio, ideally even in face of a major disaster of an unforseen scope.\n\nFor some, the answer is crypto; but for the legacy investor, it will probably be precious metals. So, which is the better investment?\n\nThe truth is that there is no easy answer. Both crypto and precious metals have their pros and cons, but how each of them would perform during a dire crisis is pure speculation. They say that history does not repeat itself in a carbon copy accurate manner, after all.\n\nHere is a brief overview of each asset class, and some key considerations for investors.\n\n\n  \n    What are crypto vs precious metals?\n\n    Crypto is a blockchain-based digital currency that uses cryptography for security. Bitcoin, the first ever cryptocurrency, runs on the oldest blockchain ever, but thousands of other cryptos have been created since.\n\n    Cryptocurrencies are decentralized, meaning they are not subject to government or financial institution control, even if the institutions try. The use of cryptos as a means of exchange is still a niche quirk.\n\n    Precious metals, on the other hand, are physical assets with a much longer history of being used as a medium of exchange and store of value. You can listen to experts and read their review of Provident Metals if you want to know more about precious metals.\n\n    Gold and silver have been used as currency for thousands of years. Today, however, precious metals are bought and sold primarily for investment purposes. The key point is that it is understood that in case of a tragic collapse of the financial system, no one would object to taking a gold coin in exchange for goods or services. That gives precious metals a lot of perceived value.\n  \n  \n    What are the key differences between crypto and precious metals?\n\n    \n\n    When it comes to crypto, there are a few key things that set it apart from precious metals. For one, crypto is digital, meaning it doesn’t have a physical form. This makes it more susceptible to hacking and theft, but on the other hand far more convenient to store and transport.\n\n    Performance-wise, crypto is much more volatile than precious metals, meaning its value can fluctuate greatly in a short period of time.\n\n    Precious metals, on the other hand, are physical commodities that have been used as currency for centuries. They’re abundant enough to be used for industrial purposes, but rare enough that they maintain a high value.\n\n    Gold and silver are the most often referenced precious metals, but others include platinum, palladium, and rhodium. Precious metals are more durable and stable than crypto, but they’re also more difficult to trade and transport.\n  \n  \n    Which asset is more liquid?\n\n    Both crypto and precious metals can be bought and sold quite easily, but practically speaking, crypto is more liquid. This is because there is a much better available market for crypto thanks to its digital form. Crypto can be traded on crypto exchanges 24/7.\n\n    Physical precious metals, on the other hand, are traded primarily through dealers, and the market is not open 24/7. This can make it more difficult to buy or sell precious metals quickly. Also, because precious metals are physical commodities, they can be more difficult to transport and store.\n\n    It’s important to remember that liquidity is important if you need to sell an asset quickly, but it’s not necessarily a good indicator of investment returns.\n  \n  \n    Which asset is more volatile?\n\n    Crypto is much more volatile than precious metals. This means that its value can fluctuate greatly in a short period of time. Since crypto doesn’t have a long track record, investors often view it as a risky investment.\n\n    Precious metals, on the other hand, have been used as currency for centuries, and their value is more stable. Gold, in particular, is often considered a safe haven asset, meaning it holds its value even during times of economic turmoil. Additionally, because precious metals are physical commodities, their supply is limited. This makes them less susceptible to sudden swings in price.\n  \n  \n    Which asset is more scarce?\n\n    Both precious metals and crypto are scarce. Precious metals are scarce because they are physical commodities that have a limited supply as a natural resource. Gold is a mined precious metal, and there is only a finite amount of it.\n\n    Cryptocurrency is not a natural resource, it can be created through digital mining or minting new units. But there are a limited number of Bitcoin that will ever be created (21 million). New brands of other cryptocurrencies can be created as needed, but due to network effect these rarely reach the popularity of the original.\n\n    You could compare the launch of new alt coins to the introduction of new kinds of precious metals that were not traded before - these don’t reach the same level of popularity as gold either.\n  \n  \n    Which asset is more durable?\n\n    \n\n    Precious metals are more durable than crypto. This is because they are physical commodities that can withstand a lot of wear and tear. Gold, for example, is obviously used in coins and jewelry that last for centuries.\n\n    Crypto, on the other hand, is digital and doesn’t have a physical form. Under current global infrastructure, this makes it more susceptible to power cuts and also to digital rot. It’s easier to store and transport, but if a person loses their private key, they will lose access to their crypto.\n  \n  \n    Which asset has a longer track record?\n\n    Precious metals have a much longer track record than crypto. Gold, in particular, has been used as currency for thousands of years. Cryptocurrency, on the other hand, was created in 2009 with the launch of Bitcoin. While crypto has grown rapidly in recent years, it doesn’t have the same long-term track record as precious metals.\n\n    If you’re looking for an asset with a history of holding its value, precious metals are clearly the only choice here, but perhaps consider diversifying your portfolio.\n  \n  \n    Which asset is more difficult to trade?\n\n    Precious metals are more difficult to trade than crypto. This is because in their physical form, they are not traded on exchanges and there is no 24/7 market for them like there is for digital assets.\n\n    Crypto, on the other hand, can be bought and sold on exchanges 24/7. As already mentioned, crypto is much more liquid than precious metals, meaning it can be traded more easily - but only as long as there is demand.\n\n    If you’re looking for an asset that you can speculate on quickly and easily, crypto is a better choice. But it’s worth noting that crypto is more volatile than precious metals, so it can be a more risky investment.\n  \n\n\nPutting it together\n\nBoth crypto and precious metals can be good investments, but they each have their own advantages and disadvantages. Precious metals are scarce, durable, and have a longer track record. However, they are also more difficult to trade and not as liquid as crypto under usual circumstances.\n\nCrypto is more volatile and has a shorter track record, but it’s easier to trade and more liquid. At the same time, they are the choice with the higher perceived risk as it is still a speculation whether crypto will be useful as a source of value in a deep financial or other crisis.\n\nKeep in mind that when deciding which asset to invest in, it’s important to consider your investment goals and risk tolerance.\n",

      content: "The FIFA World Cup is one of the most anticipated sports events in the world. Held every four years, its new edition is now fast approaching. With everyone’s expectations at an all-time high, many are predicting which team will stand out among the rest.\n\nThe previous World Cup, which was held back in 2018, was an eventful one. France ended up taking the win after competing against Croatia in a heated battle. With this, the French team took home their second FIFA World Cup title. Their last win was back in 1998.\n\nAs the most anticipated upcoming sports event for betting, bettors will not pass up this opportunity as it’s a great way to make money on the side - crypto or fiat.\n\nTo effectively win more wagers, it is key to be well-informed. Here is what you can expect in the upcoming FIFA World Cup:\n\nWhen and where is this year’s FIFA World Cup?\n\nThis year’s FIFA World Cup will be held at eight different stadiums in Doha, the capital city of Qatar.\n\nIn a month, a tight schedule filled with soccer matches will commence by November 20. Teams will have to progress and rank high through a group stage before being able to compete in the knockout stages.\n\nThis stage includes the quarter-finals, the semi-finals, the third-place match, and the finals, which are set to happen by December 18.\n\nHow many teams qualify for the cup?\n\nThis year’s FIFA World Cup will field 32 teams that have qualified through intercontinental qualifying tournaments held within six zones under the association’s facilitation. The World Cup has featured 32 teams since France in 1998 for the last six iterations of the tournament.\n\nJoining the lineup of teams this year, 2022, is the host nation, Qatar. Here is how the current lineup looks for the Cup:\n\n\n  Africa (CAF): 5 teams\n  Asia (AFC): 6 teams\n  Europe (UEFA): 13 teams\n  North/Central America &amp; Caribbean (CONCACAF): 4 teams\n  South America (CONMEBOL): 4 teams\n\n\nCurrent favourites of the competition\n\nAs the most prestigious and grand sports event in the world, the FIFA World Cup features the most talented teams across the globe. Many anticipate the likes of Brazil, France, England, and Spain due to their records and their overall performance during the past Cups.\n\nAs the current favourites in the competition, bettors will be locked on their games for the whole month to see if they win they would win their wager or not.\n\nThe other team’s punters are on the lookout for Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, and Argentina, who all have the potential to win the Cup as well.\n\nFIFA World Cup winner prediction\n\nThe most favoured team prior to the World Cup in Brazil.\n\nThe nation has won five titles and has strong and talented players on its roster. Although they have yet to win another Cup since their last one back in 2002, there is great expectation for them to become victors this year.\n\nOne of Brazil’s most talented players is Neymar, the main playmaker of the national team. He has set astounding records in past World Cup qualifying matches.\n\nWith him at the front of the team, they went 17 games unbeaten during the South American Football Confederation (CONMEBOL) qualifiers.\n\nOther notable Brazilian players include Marquinhos, Casemiro, Fabinho, and Allison. Although France, England, and Spain are Brazil’s strong contenders, they still have a decent shot at winning the tournament.\n\nEnjoy some of the best soccer games at the FIFA World Cup\n\nAs the most awaited upcoming sports event for betting, you can imagine how excited both fans and punters are for this coming FIFA World Cup.\n\nWith fierce competition leading the FIFA World Rankings at the moment, you can expect to see some of the most heated and adrenaline-pumping sports matches in the world.\n",

      title: "Where to trade the prediction markets for ETH Merge",
      content: "The Ethereum merge is a big milestone for the ETH cryptocurrency. It’s expected to occur between 10-20 September 2022, and it will mark the transition from its current Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism based on mining into the Proof Of Stake (PoS) mechanism based on cold staking.\n\nThis move could very well be one if not the most significant events in Ethereum’s original roadmap. The community consensus is on the side of the PoS chain but the exact implications of the event are still unknown.\n\nHere’s where you can trade on the potential outcomes of the ETH Merge event.\n\nPhemex has the most straightforward ETH Merge market\n\nPhemex is one of the exchanges that runs an ETH merge prediction market.\n\nIn their Merge Pool you can bet whether or not the ETH prices will increase exactly 1 week after the Merge. The data will be taken from the block that is exactly 1 week post merge with prices taken from Coingecko.\n\nPhemex made the merge prediction market dead simple. It’s a simple either-or.\n\nThis is how the merge prediction market works:\n\n  You deposit some amount of USDT to it, either to the bullish or the bearish side.\n  User wagers contribute to the total size of the market pool.\n  Your USDT gets you a number of shares in the market.\n  If you wagered on the right side of history, you will be one of the winners.\n  Winners will split the total pool in proportion to their number of shares.\n\n\nThe oldest method in the book, and why not if it works.\n\nHere’s one note worth sharing, you can only bet on one side of the market, sub-accounts are banned from participating and any form of cheating will get you disqualified. The other note worth sharing is that Phemex is a no-KYC exchange.\n\nPhemex Merge Pool\n\nBitfinex launches chain-split tokens for ETH Merge\n\nBitfinex is taking a more complex route that leaves more options for traders. Users can generate chain-split tokens (CST) and trade them until they expire at the consummation of the Merge or at the end of 2022, whichever comes first.\n\nThe CSTs on Bitfinex are derivative tokens that will allow you to trade on the potential fork event in Ethereum’s consensus protocol. Trading in derivatives on Bitfinex is only available to at least intermediate KYC’d users in eligible jurisdictions.\n\nThe chain split would happen in case a canonical PoW blockchain would emerge along the PoS one. In theory, these two could keep existing side-by-side like ETH and ETC or BTC and BCH.\n\nHow the Bitfinex CST tokens work\n\nTo take part in the ETH Merge markets on Bitfinex, you can generate CST tokens in the Token Manager tool by spending ETH. The tool will generate an equal amount of ETHW and ETHS (PoW and PoS derivative tokens) which you then can trade to reach your desired ratio.\n\n\n\nThe Chain Split Tokens will trade against USDt, USD and ETH as pairs: ETHS/USDt and ETHW/USDt, ETHS/USD and ETHW/USD and ETHS/ETH and ETHW/ETH. Leverage will not be available.\n\nThe tokens will expire once the Merge is consummated or at the end of the year in case that never happens. At expiry, users will be either credited ETH in exchange for the respective token in case only a single consensus chain emerges. Else they will be granted the proportional amounts of tokens of each chain.\n\nThe tokens are redeemable back for ETH at any time in case you want to exit before the tokens expire.\n\nGo to Bitfinex\n\nBitfinex is launching quite a unique market, most exchanges didn’t rush into considering the possibility of a chain split.\n\nEven FTX announced that they will implicitly support the PoS chain in the event of a chain split, but would credit users with the PoW fork as well.\n\nThe Australian Independent Reserve on the other hand announced that they would not even credit the PoW fork and users should withdraw in case they would want that token.\n",

      title: "Why are people's expensive NFTs vanishing from their accounts?",
      content: "Opensea is still the most popular platform that lists volumes of NFTs, specialising in low-key NFTs good for traders to speculate on. There are other, high profile NFT markets that build their branding around selling art that is hand-picked, thoroughly researched and therefore very costly. These are closed NFT marketplaces: Artists who can sell on them are carefully selected, not everybody gets in.\n\nOpensea doesn’t do that, they run an open marketplace. Everyone can make an account and start selling their NFTs. That is great for lowering the barriers of entry but it opens the door to fraud.\n\nAnd fraud is the reason why people’s NFTs are often vanishing. If the marketplace finds that it listed an NFT that breached some part of their terms of use, such as being a forgery of a different artwork, that NFT gets booted from the platform.\n\nThe NFTs do not actually vanish\n\nWhen you buy an NFT on Opensea or anywhere else, it is your crypto wallet that receives the token, not your Opensea account.\n\nIf the NFT breaches terms of use, the marketplace will have to delist it so as to not be complicit in a breach of law. You still own the NFT, but your Opensea account will not render it anymore.\n\nIf you want to verify that, download one of the web3-friendly wallets that support NFT galleries such as Metamask or Exodus. Import you wallet there and you will find your delisted NFTs.\n\nSo does the delisting of your NFT mean nothing for you? Well, it means that you probably won’t turn profit on that NFT, because it’s either a forgery or for some other reason it will be difficult to get it listed anywhere for sale.\n\nHow does this impact the NFT trading market?\n\nOver time, detection of forgeries on the side of the marketplace will probably improve - but as is known from the world of traditional art, it’s never perfect.\n\n\n\nSo long as there is a risk of forgeries making their way onto marketplaces like Opensea, there will be the risk of NFTs being delisted and vanishing, and worse, as a consequence becoming pretty much worthless.\n\nThis is not likely going to have any chilling effect on the NFT market as a whole. The bulk of Opensea traders treat NFTs as a chartless alternative to penny stocks or low cap cryptos - you spend some money on them hoping to maybe make it out well.\n\nIt deserves to be noted though that since wash trading and artificial inflating of prices is common in NFTs, some of the fake tokens can get quite expensive. Some people will see that as a tuition paid by the trader, some will probably start complaining that all crypto is a scam.\n\nFinal words\n\nNFTs are the latest application of blockchain technology that are claiming to revolutionize the markets for digital collectibles, event tickets, and commodified culture as a whole. It is one of the last tradable spaces where people display any form of revolutionary attitudes, a sentiment that seems by and large as unwarranted.\n\nHowever, because NFTs are unregulated and live on the blockchain, they also open the door to fraud. This is why people’s NFTs are often vanishing from Opensea and other marketplaces. While this may not have a chilling effect on the NFT market as a whole, it is something that traders should keep in mind when investing in these digital assets.\n",

      title: "Does blockchain have what it takes to eliminate real estate agents?",
      content: "Blockchain has been a hot topic in the real estate industry ever since blockchain technology started producing tons of altcoins that were meant to change every imaginable niche.\n\nThat mood now cooled off with the onset of the recession, although I hope it’s not an ideological crime to call it that.\n\nSome people believe that blockchain will eventually replace real estate agents, while others think that blockchain will simply change the way that real estate transactions are conducted.\n\nSo what uses can blockchain have in the future of the real estate industry?\n\nWhat are the benefits of using blockchain in real estate?\n\nThe use of blockchain technology in any industry is still in its early stages, but there are a couple of ways that in which blockchain can already be used.\n\nIt’s nothing high-tech, however: At the moment, you could realistically use cryptocurrencies only as a means of payment.\n\nStill, if used correctly, it does improve the process of buying and selling property.\n\nSome of the benefits of using blockchain in real estate include:\n\n\n  Increased transparency: Signing an address with a random string is a super simple way to prove to the selling party that you have the means to cover the amount.\n  Reduced costs, especially for cross-border transactions: When you buy property in a country where you don’t have a bank account, usually that transfer gets rather expensive. You will almost certainly need to pay a fee for transfer in a foreign currency. On top of that, some countries also impose a tax on transactions coming from abroad.\n  Credit report without credit report: On public blockchains, it is trivial to verify how long a coin resided on a specific address. If a buyer comes with an address that has held coins for years, it can be taken as a proof of good financial standing of the buyer.\n\n\n\n\nCan blockchain completely eliminate the need for real estate agents?\n\nWhile it is still too early to say whether blockchain technology will have a role in the future of real estate, it is quite certain that blockchain will never completely eliminate the need for real estate agents.\n\nBlockchain has the potential to significantly change the way that real estate transactions are conducted, but only as far as the back office side of real estate is concerned.\n\nBlockchain is just a system for storing data or a system for computing data, but real estate agents are sales people who are experts on the neighborhoods of their city. Blockchain does not have what it takes to recommend a good neighborhood fit for you, or to sell your property at a good price pre-market.\n\nArtificial intelligence could maybe one day do that, but even that is far fetched. Either way, blockchain simply does not have what it takes to eliminate real estate agents.\n\nFinal words\n\nWill blockchain eventually replace real estate agents? Almost certainly not, but there are a number of ways that blockchain could be used to improve the process of buying and selling property.\n\nSome of the benefits of using blockchain in real estate include: increased security and transparency, reduced costs, and faster transactions. There are also some risks associated with using blockchain in real estate, including fraud and privacy issues.\n\nWhile it is still too early to say whether or not blockchain will completely eliminate the need for real estate agents, it is clear that it has the potential to significantly change the way that real estate transactions are conducted.\n",

      title: "Bitfinex runs a crypto analysis newsletter that's probably the best out there right now",
      content: "Onchain analysis, famous for its ever-bullish predictions, has been heavily scrutinized by the crypto community and became something of a laughingstock. That doesn’t mean that onchain itself is trash, though.\n\nThe problem with onchain as with most other crypto analysis these days is that it treats crypto as if it were able to chart its own course, when it is not.\n\nThe reality is that crypto at the moment trades along with high-risk assets and tech indices. That does not say anything about crypto’s fundamentals, it is based purely on perceived risks and utilities of a novel asset.\n\nCrypto fundamentals are always the same, but the market needs a proof\n\nUntil a few years back, crypto traded independently and was not correlated with legacy finance the way it is now. That was because crypto was in its penny stock phase: Nobody cared about it.\n\nNow that the institutional adoption happened, the perceived value of crypto changed and will not change again until crypto proves its utility beyond serving as a high-risk diversification tool in portfolio balancing.\n\nThis is why these days, it doesn’t make any sense at all to analyse crypto on its own, without considering legacy markets and the broader economic conditions.\n\nYou might even make your analyses quite sophisticated, like we see in the blog of Arthur Hayes - it won’t change anything. One day that will be the way to read these markets but for now, it’s too early for that.\n\nGood crypto analysis takes into account the bigger picture\n\nSo, where to get that kind of info?\n\nThere are a number of newsletters for financial analysis out there, but the ones from legacy sources that mention crypto are usually completely skeptical of it as a whole.\n\nOn the other hand the crypto native ones tend to be dedicated to hopium dealership, no matter how far from reality that takes their audience.\n\nI skim a lot of free crypto newsletters. Most of what lands in my mailbox from Substack is Defiant.io or other publications related to the NFT flavour of the week. It’s is mostly just noise with a flashy graphic design, I haven’t found any good market analysis on Substack yet.\n\nBelow are the newsletter that I often find worth looking at:\n\n\n  The LocalCryptos P2P market runs a newsletter that, true to the opinions of the marketplace’s founder,  highlights the political implications of current events, such as the holding an author of an open source code responsible for the misuse of the code in the recent Tornado Cash issue.\n  CryptoBits is a newsletter from the OTC platform B2C2. Every week it comes with a chart that breaks down who’s buying and who’s selling: small family shops vs larger organisations, based in North America, Asia vs Europe.\n  Bitfinex Alpha is quite obviously a newsletter written by people who have some skin in the game, or at least are very good at acting like they do. It is a realistic look at what matters for the crypto markets, including its weaknesses and the broader context.\n\n\nThat’s pretty much it. Kraken runs an insight newsletter for their traders too but I never thought it was any good. The analyses are too wordy for a text that is narrowly focused on (usually) a sh1tcoin.\n\nAnother newsletter that is quite good is the one of Independent Reserve, but it’s just a plain overview of the past week’s news headlines as seen by an OTC desk based in Australia.\n\nIf you are used to forever bullish on-chain news or on the NFT gossip, you might be in for a shock especially with Bitfinex Alpha.\n\nBitfinex, as you know, is one of the most popular cryptocurrency exchanges in the world with a wide range of markets, most of them still open to no-KYC users. The platform is well positioned as the place where crypto whales trade (until the market manages their risks for them). Being kind of in the shadows, Bitfinex is probably not the place that will ever be able to rely on the same type of marketing as Coinbase, Kraken or FTX.\n\nIt certainly seems like Bitfinex is taking the route of providing value to those traders who want to be profitable and will stick around, rather than to gamblers.\n\nBelow you can read the intro of the Alpha issue 19 from the end of August 2022.\n\nYou don’t actually have to trade on Bitfinex if you want to subscribe. Go to the Bitfinex homepage, scroll down to “NEWS” and click on the latest Bitfinex Alpha post - it has an opt-in form inside.\n\n\n\n",

      title: "How the Gaming Industry Helps Crypto Grow",
      content: "In 2022, the gaming industry started embracing blockchain technology faster than ever before.\n\nIt’s been a few years now that blockchain-based games have been gaining popularity but now, a whole industry of decentralized gaming applications is a reality complete with play-to-earn opportunities and NFT collectibles.\n\nUntil now, crypto has been helping the gaming industry boom and develop. However, in the long run, the reverse becomes true: Crypto is also growing as a result of its usage in the gaming industry.\n\nHere’s how.\n\nRole of crypto in the gaming industry\n\nThe gaming business has helped cryptocurrencies grow in sophistication.\n\nThe basic idea of crypto is simple: Digital money that employs encryption to safeguard, confirm, and speed up transactions. The result is that you can pay online without using a credit card.\n\nPayments for a variety of in-game items, including characters, images, power-ups, themes, and distinctive artifacts are made much faster thanks to cryptocurrencies - and in the entertainment industry, speed matters a great deal.\n\nThen there is P2E, or play-to-earn, a model that enables gamers to acquire incentives or cryptocurrency tokens directly through gameplay.\n\nOther than that, there are many ways that blockchain technology is being applied in the gaming business. An example is creating crypto casino games. Slots, roulette and blackjack games built on the blockchain are secure, fair and fun to play.\n\nWhy gamers prefer crypto\n\nThe details above paint a pretty clear picture of the areas where cryptocurrency and gaming converge.\n\nMore of a mystery, though, is why gamers like cryptocurrency so much. But there are motivations for why gamers might prefer using cryptocurrency.\n\nNearly three-fourths of online gamers are engaging in trading of their virtual game assets. With the help of cryptocurrencies, you may acquire and exchange virtual in-game items quite easily.\n\nAnywhere in the world, crypto assets are easily transferable and exchangeable practically without restrictions, as long as you transact peer-to-peer between self-hosted wallets.\n\nThat’s important these days. But overall, one of the key factors favoring crypto assets is the fact that they provide a simple and accessible way of making money.\n\nIn-app transactions, in-app ads, and affiliate marketing are the three main revenue sources of the products in the gaming sector.\n\nUtilizing tokens makes it simpler and faster to purchase in-game products like extra lives or unique personalities. Then also, gaming sites frequently employ cryptocurrency incentives such as bounties and competitions. You may complete surveys and view video commercials in return for which gaming sites provide players cryptocurrency.\n\nPlatforms for crypto casinos are also embracing bitcoin pay-outs and payments. This makes it possible for owners of digital assets to locate a location where they may easily leverage their cryptocurrency holdings.\n\nWays the gaming industry is helping crypto grow\n\nThe following are some of the main ways in which crypto is growing thanks to the impact of the gaming industry:\n\n\n  \n    Opportunities for employment and business for crypto specialists\n\n    More people with blockchain and cryptocurrency skills are required as the gaming industry develops. The blockchain sector is expanding as a result of the growing popularity of cryptocurrency gaming and the technology that enables it. This is known as the trickle-down effect, it is causing a rise in the need for industry specialists.\n\n    Since about 2020, blockchain technology has reached a stage where businesses and even authorities are starting to see its potential. It makes people’s lives better and builds stronger organizations.\n\n    The same situation holds for public relations firms. A growing number of companies employ subject-matter specialists to assist customers and aid in boosting press and commercial attention.\n\n    Whatever the industry, smart businesses always prefer niche specialists to achieve their objectives.\n  \n  \n    Universal usage of cryptos\n\n    In recent years, the regular banking sector has started to adopt crypto more. There is no doubt that the continued use of crypto in the multi-billion gaming industry has aided the adoption of cryptocurrencies.\n\n    Cryptos are now universally known payment methods in different online transactions and business activities.\n\n    As you know, in September 2021, El Salvador became the first nation to accept Bitcoin as legal cash. Continuing this pattern, several other countries in the world are recognizing Bitcoin as legal cash.\n\n    The likelihood that additional nations will include cryptocurrencies in their current financial systems is rising. This will enhance the adoption rates into systems and foster even more user confidence.\n  \n  \n    Government regulations\n\n    Government regulation of crypto is still a major point of discussion in many countries. The lack of a legal framework makes it unclear what is allowed, which can stifle innovation. This may have a negative effect on the industry.\n\n    Cryptocurrency gaming, as a major global industry, is necessitating governments to come up with regulations to control and help the sector thrive. New factors are coming up including Defi and even the metaverse that will it difficult to control the sector.\n\n    Both fans and critics have called attention to technology in the global media. Therefore, establishing clear rules for what is permitted and prohibited in virtual reality would aid in legitimizing activities in the cryptocurrency business.\n  \n  \n    Trading resources and earning rewards\n\n    Any property or asset that you own can be exchanged for money or resources, and the other way round.\n\n    It is easy to earn even your very first crypto in play-to-earn games and in bounty campaigns. In conventional games, for the same work you would be awarded game points that are only good within the game. Crypto on the other hand is useful outside of the game too, because you can freely exchange it for real-world assets.\n\n    Sometimes you don’t even have to, some e-commerce websites allow you to purchase goods and pay with crypto. In this manner, the gaming industry contributes a lot to the development of crypto.\n  \n  \n    Increased potential for NFTs\n\n    The gaming industry is contributing massively to the nascent NFT industry. NFT gaming is expanding quickly, but more significantly, NFT players are giving their pastimes a purpose.\n\n    The potential of non-fungible tokens is enormous since they may be used to transfer rights about both physical and digital property. Therefore, established institutions like art galleries and museums are likely to treat and hold NFTs as their interest grows.\n\n    Most big businesses and celebs are embracing NFTs as the future foundation of the virtual world of business. The NFT market is attractive because it resembles the early days of the internet. Numerous emerging IT enterprises are attempting to enter the market with their distinct enthusiasm and flare.\n  \n\n\nConclusion\n\nThe gaming industry is becoming critical to the growth of crypto around the world. Its usage in the gaming sector is essential in meeting blockchain technological needs. Additionally, it is creating more opportunities and a favorable environment for crypto to thrive even in the future.\n",

      title: "NFT royalties: Not actually as innovative as their proponents claim",
      content: "NFT royalties are a fee that the NFT artists receive for their work whenever it gets resold. They’re paid in crypto to the address from which the NFT originated. By convention the full fee usually amounts to 10% of the art’s value, 5% of which goes to the artist.\n\nThat fee is a big cut for speculative traders, who need to take that royalty fee into account when they are derisking.\n\nDo you have to pay NFT royalties? Nope. That’s the short answer, at least.\n\nNFT royalties are a convention\n\nNFT royalties exist by convention. The OG NFT artists demanded them from marketplaces and were successful in that. Over time the royalty fee became standard.\n\nNowadays the royalty payment is built in with the transaction process on most big NFT marketplaces like Opensea.\n\nBut they usually not built into the NFT itself. If you don’t want to pay the royalty, technically you can just … not honour the convention.\n\nAnd that’s exactly what sudoswap.xyz did when they launched their AMM for NFTs. The trading fee there is just 0.5% and that’s it.\n\nYou don’t pay the royalty because they didn’t build it in. Sudoswap in fact made it their main selling point.\n\n\n\nNFT royalties are not as progressive as their proponents claim\n\nThe community that form around NFT trading is divided on the topic of royalties.\n\nThe main current claims that that’s why NFT art is so revolutionary: It’s Web3 way of rewarding the artists. Blockchain finally makes it possible to trace the payments fairly and openly, artists can finally get the royalties they deserve. Crypto makes the payments secure and transparent, so everyone can see what’s going on.\n\nI’d venture a guess that the material point is really that NFT royalties accrue with traded volume. The fee gets paid every time the NFT gets resold. It’s 5% which is not a lot, but if the artwork trades a lot, the artist gains a lot in royalties.\n\nIt’s the same principle as with P2P crypto arbitrage where you get a margin of around 2.5%, or the half of the typical NFT royalty, but if you have enough demand to cycle your money between P2P and CEX quickly, you can do the proverbial doubling of your bitcoin in one year, as shown in the case study in this strategy.\n\nWith the boom of speculative trading in NFTs, royalties work really well for the artists.\n\n\n\nThe problem with NFT royalties is that they need to be enforced, just like traditional royalties. Insisting on payments for artists in NFTs will just replay the history of the music industry.\n\nKevin Parker from the Australian band Tame Impala said in a Reddit AMA a few years back he thinks music will be free at some point anyway, and that he’s up for it. “You want to know a story? Up until recently, from all of Tame Impala’s record sales outside of Australia I had received…. zero dollars.” The royalties went on distribution and marketing.\n\nWere they paying him on blockchain, he would have known where exactly his royalties went. But if he was bound by a contract that authorised other people to make marketing expenses on his behalf, seeing the money trail probably wouldn’t have helped him in any way.\n\nIs this ‘decentralization’?\n\nThe only way to enforce the worldwide honouring of a royalty fee is to create a dedicated, burocratic industry around it. That’s about as revolutionary as the graphic design of Zuck’s Metaverse avatar.\n\nNFTs have demonstrated they do have utility. We see that sometimes with NFT keys in retroactive airdrops. These NFTs are a powerful tool as a key that is bound only with a crypto address.\n\nIt entitles the address that holds the NFT to receiving income or to getting access to a platform and says good night and good luck to regulators - you can always move the NFT, the platform can always generate a new NFT key if necessary.\n\nBlockchain doesn’t solve the problem of your not getting the money that you’re due, it never will. But at least let it be used for something innovative.\n\n\n\nthebaffler.com: “The Problem with Music”, December 1993\n",

      title: "Major Crypto Trends in 2022 (The Good, The Bad and The Ugly)",
      content: "The year 2021 was a defining one for the cryptocurrency market. Major announcements such as Tesla’s investment in cryptocurrency and countries adopting cryptocurrency in transactions gave the market significant traction.\n\nCrypto experts predict significant cryptocurrency trends in 2022 and beyond. The cryptocurrencies’ current total market capitalization is over $1 trillion. The number of crypto users is growing daily and evolving at light speed.\n\nThere has been a rise in altcoins and technical innovations that will increase crypto adoption. Here are some of the exciting developments to look forward to.\n\n\n  \n    Metaverse\n\n    \n\n    The Metaverse is a virtual world facilitated by augmented and virtual reality. It combines some elements of the physical and digital world. While you can already enjoy casino games through Slots lv login, the Metaverse will reinforce the experience and make it more immersive.\n\n    Unlike with the traditional gaming experiences, the engagement that Metaverse promises should be on a whole another level. Metaverse never sleeps!\n\n    It will allow you to do things you cannot do in the conventional gaming environment, and if cryptocurrencies will facilitate the payments there, entertainment will be even easier to get.\n\n    The Metaverse presents a huge opportunity for the crypto market. It might just become the mainstream medium of exchange in the Metaverse. Cryptocurrencies will be used to pay for tickets, trade digital assets, socialize and interact with brands.\n\n    Each Metaverse platform will have its accepted cryptocurrencies. These will be used to purchase virtual real estate, transfer NFTs ownership, buy avatars, and pay for everything else. For instance, in Decentraland, one of the popular metaverse platforms, the mainstream token is MANA.\n  \n  \n    Looming Regulation\n\n    \n\n    One of the negative trends this year has been the looming strict regulation aiming to cut the wings of the crypto industry.\n\n    Crypto holders should expect increased attempts at regulation in the crypto market even though the basic principle of blockchain technology is the lack of regulation.\n\n    The widespread adoption of cryptocurrency calls for regulation to curb terrorism financing and money laundering. Several US government agencies have already been ordered to assess the opportunities and risks of cryptocurrencies to develop strategies for regulating the industry.\n\n    The regulation also comes with several concerns, as it could push away investors that embraced cryptocurrencies due to decentralization and the opportunities that come with the unregulated status. More so, some investors have concerns that the anonymity and transparency of cryptocurrencies could be compromised.\n\n    While regulation could impede growth and innovation in the crypto market, it could also attract a new wave of more risk-averse investors who have been on the fence until now. This could pave the way for mainstream acceptance and adoption of cryptocurrencies.\n\n    \n\n    Well implemented regulations could increase stability in the very volatile cryptocurrency market. This will ultimately be a good thing for investors as it will prevent fraudulent activity in the crypto market, and the stability will protect long-term investors. Regulation will give investors more clarity on how they can invest in the crypto market.\n\n    At the same time, while governments and relevant agencies look to increase regulation, they should also consider doing it in a way that encourages innovation.\n  \n  \n    Continued Growth of NFTs\n\n    \n\n    NFTs give users bragging rights to digital assets representing tangible art items, or the full ownership of purely virtual art.\n\n    NFTs are stored on blockchains. The digital assets cannot be destroyed, replicated, or removed. But other than that, they don’t work like cryptocurrencies; NFTs are not divisible.\n\n    More people have been adopting NFTs for the status, to support artists or also collect airdrop rights. It’s not difficult to buy credible and authentic digital assets like albums, videos, and images. This allows artists to capitalize on their digital creations.\n\n    The NFT market is expected to grow, positively impacting the crypto market, especially if the Metaverse project catches on.\n\n    In the optimistic scenarios, people will be going for NFTs to protect their rights to physical and virtual properties, protect documents, facilitate contract negotiations, and verify diverse credentials.\n\n    The good thing is that increased adoption of NFTs should increase the audience of all crypto markets and open more possibilities for the use of digital currencies.\n  \n  \n    Extreme Amount of New Altcoins Launching\n\n    The amount of existing cryptocurrencies has been growing since the launch of the first digital currency.\n\n    Currently, there are over 10,000 different cryptocurrencies in circulation, and the number is expected to grow. Investors are faced with the challenge of determining which blockchains to invest in.\n\n    Some estimate that by 2030 the crypto market will have tripled. The increase in cryptocurrency users globally will cause an even larger jump in the amount of newly launched cryptocurrencies, most likely with repetitive features.\n\n    It is important to remember the impact on the carbon footprint: The sheer amount of useless tokens could push environment-conscious investors away.\n\n    Still, as far as the barrier to generating new altcoins remains low, there will most likely be an increase in crypto coins. Even today, people can launch a crypto token with zero technical know-how by outsourcing it - it is not expensive.\n  \n  \n    Increased DeFi Adoption\n\n    The use of blockchain-powered decentralized financial services is not going anywhere, in fact it is expected to rise.\n\n    For instance, more people will choose smart contracts to yield interest payments over intermediaries such as banks.\n\n    Increased adoption of decentralized finance will have more investors tie their assets to cryptocurrency, which can be good or bad. Should there be a security breach for instance, a collapse of a DeFi institution could negatively impact the whole industry.\n  \n\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile the crypto market faces challenges, the growth projections are positive. As government agencies regulate the market, more investors will trust blockchain technology. More so, institutions will find the structure appealing and adopt cryptos.\n\nThe increased acceptance is also expected to see a rise in crypto coins and innovations, which will further see a boom in the crypto market.\n",

      title: "Everything You Need to Know About Bad Credit Loans",
      content: "It can be a huge challenge to improve your credit score, but for most people it is one of the most crucial elements in securing your financial future. A bad credit score can set you back in your career and life as it hinders you from acquiring a loan.\n\nStill, there are loan companies (in the crypto industry and outside of it) that cater to individuals with low credit scores. Here’s everything that you need to know about bad credit loans.\n\nWhat is a bad credit score?\n\nA credit score of 670 and under is regarded as a bad credit score. Usually, a bad credit score occurs after a bad credit history, such as not being able to repay your debts on time.\n\nBad credit scores generally mean that the client has a history of not paying their bills and debts in time. That is why they are viewed in a negative light by banks and loan providers, they make you a risky client to lend to.\n\nThere are several reasons why you might have a low credit score. Usually, a low credit score occurs because of:\n\n\n  Late payment of your bills\n  Late payment of your debts\n  Taking out credit unnecessarily\n  Defaults\n  Bankruptcy\n\n\nBad credit score makes it more difficult to acquire loans. However, each company has its categories and policies for servicing individuals with ‘bad’ credit scores.\n\nCan you get a loan with a low credit score?\n\nYou can, but usually on different terms than people with higher credit scores.\n\nCertain loans, categorized as ‘bad credit loans’, can only be acquired by individuals with a poor credit score who are seeking to borrow money for a specified period.\n\nAs mentioned above, there are some lenders that specialize in borrowers with poor credit; these companies will be willing to overlook your poor credit score to provide you with a loan. Such companies also view individuals with low credit scores more positively than other companies do in that they do not flat out refuse working with them.\n\nMost people with a low credit score or not enough credit history are only eligible for bad credit loans. However, if you have a decent credit score, you may be able to qualify for homeowner or guarantor loans.\n\nWhat is a Bad credit loan?\n\nAs the name suggests, a bad credit loan is a means of providing for those individuals with a poor credit score or those who do not have enough credit history to qualify for other loans.\n\nThe terms of bad credit loans reflect the increased risk the creditor undertakes. This means that bad credit loans usually have high interest rates, higher than other loans, and the total loan amount is usually relatively low. These factors help lower the risk assumed by creditors.\n\nIf you only qualify for a bad credit loan because of your lack of credit history, then instead of looking at your credit history, companies will review your financial circumstances to see whether you will be able to repay the loan or not.\n\nStill, if you have a poor credit history (or none at all), a bad credit loan is the best option for you.\n\nTypes of bad credit loans\n\n\n  Personal loans: One of the most commonly used loans is personal loans; these loans involve borrowing a specific amount, which is to be repaid within 1 to 7 years. The best part about these loans is that they have a fixed interest rate, so there’s no ambiguity on how much you’ll have to pay back to your lender every month.\n  Homeowner loans: Your house is used as collateral to secure homeowner loans. For this reason, it’s easier to borrow a substantial amount when you acquire a homeowner loan. However, there’s a high level of risk attached to it; you could potentially lose your home if you fail to repay your debt. Interest rates for homeowner loans are usually not high, and these loans can have a repayment period of around 20 to 25 years.\n  Guarantor loans: These loans involve an individual, preferably a relative, promising to make repayments on your behalf in case you find yourself in a situation where you cannot. If your guarantor has a good credit history, you might just be able to acquire the loan at a lower interest rate.\n\n\nDoes a personal loan impact your credit score?\n\nInitially, applying for a loan will cause your credit score to go down further. Lenders need to pull out hard inquiries on the people they are lending money to, and hard inquiries usually cause a dip in your credit score.\n\nHowever, this drop in your credit score will be temporary, and practicing good credit habits will help boost your credit score. By making your payments on time, you can increase your credit score in the long run.\n\nA bad credit loan will also help you with your credit mix (that is around 10% of your credit score), which will further cause a rise in your credit score.\n\nBottom line\n\nWhile there are pros and cons to bad credit loans, they are one way of improving your credit history and proving to companies that you are a trustworthy borrower.\n\nBad credit loans can boost your credit score if you’re regular with your payments.\n\nOver time, as your credit score starts to increase, you’ll gain credit history and will be able to secure new loans at much better terms in the future.\n\nAll you have to do is stick to your monthly budget and be prompt with your payments. This way, you’ll secure a future free from financial worries for you and your family.\n",

      title: "5 Reasons Why The Internet Buys NFTs Today",
      content: "One of the most popular forms of digital investment nowadays is the non-fungible token or NFT.\n\nNFT is a term used to describe digitally-encrypted assets, which can come in many forms, such as audio or video materials, artwork, literature but also others like legal documents or the right to a referral commission.\n\nThese digital assets are called non-fungible because, much like a unique cryptographic key, they can’t be exchanged or replaced with other items of the same value. In technical terms, NFTs are uniquely identified through cryptographic certificates or digital tokens uniquely assigned to each asset.\n\nNon-fungible tokens have continued to gain popularity in the investment world because they’re seen as the next big thing with significant growth potential.\n\nMost investors nowadays prefer to invest virtually in digital assets, which among other things brings a growing demand for NFTs.\n\nAnd then there all those who performed well in their crypto investments. They are now looking at NFT as the next logical step because it uses the same blockchain technology behind cryptocurrency.\n\nSince it’s now easier and more convenient than ever for investors worldwide to buy NFT online, more and more buyers are taking an interest in joining this market.\n\nIf you’re wondering why people buy NFTs and if investing in NFTs is a good idea for you, here are some reasons you can consider to help you decide:\n\n\n  \n    NFTs Can Diversify Their Crypto Portfolio\n\n    \n\n    One of the main reasons people decide to invest in NFT is its potential to increase in value in the years to come exponentially. For this reason, many investors view NFT as a great way to diversify their crypto portfolios.\n\n    NFTs are commonly valued and denominated in cryptocurrency, with Ethereum being the primary currency for many digital marketplaces. Hence, those looking to distribute their altcoin investment into ventures with excellent potential choose NFT.\n\n    If you want to diversify your cryptocurrency investments, the best time to invest in NFT is now since it allows you to purchase tokens before the market demand pushes prices upwards. This way, you can save money and optimize your earnings through these assets in the future.\n  \n  \n    To Achieve Their Long-Term Investment Goals\n\n    Many view NFTs as a wise long-term investment option, especially for those looking to grow their digital assets and currency investments.\n\n    When you purchase a digital asset, selling it for profit may take some time. Instead, it’s wise to let the value appreciate over time and find the best method to earn profits by selling the item on the right platform or occasion. For instance, some digital marketplaces allow sellers to sell NFT for free as a part of a promotion, which can help you save on transaction or gas fees.\n\n    Should you decide to take this route, investing in the right NFTs can help you attain your long-term financial goals because you’re aligning resources that would match this purpose.\n  \n  \n    To Learn More About Opportunities In Blockchain Technology\n\n    \n\n    Investment opportunities in blockchain technology don’t have to end with NFTs. If you want to expand your portfolio, then it’s best to be on the lookout for the latest digital investment trend you can take advantage of.\n\n    Investing in non-fungible tokens can be a way to solidify your footing in the digital asset market and keep up with the fast-paced crypto community.\n\n    The NFT industry has the potential to expand your network beyond the usual crypto trader type because you will get to meet people like art brokers or collectors.\n\n    At the very least, you’ll gain access to the latest developments that can benefit your investment portfolio.\n  \n  \n    To Be A Part Of An Elite Circle\n\n    Yes, we have come this far. Some investors choose to buy expensive NFTs like the Bored Ape Yacht Club for the status that they earn with their ownership.\n\n    There is a lot to gain from that to those who seek access to exclusive communities of elite investors. Owning an NFT is just the entrance ticket among those who are famous or prestigious in their fields or industries.\n\n    As the NFT space gets crowded, this will eventually stop working but right now, we are still living through the early days. If you want to meet celebrities and prominent crypto industry figures, joining the NFT market can effectively make these invaluable connections.\n  \n  \n    To Support Their Favorite Creators\n\n    Apart from the financial gain and connections, some investors decide to enter the non-fungible tokens market to support their favorite creators.\n\n    If you’re following artists, directors, filmmakers, or even businesses who have produced digital assets, purchasing their work in the form of NFTs is a great way to show your support.\n\n    On top of that, you have a good chance of meeting like-minded individuals who have the same interests as yours, making the experience more rewarding and meaningful for you.\n  \n\n\nConclusion\n\nIf you’re thinking of investing in NFTs, it’s best to also invest your time and effort to learn more about this market, especially since it’s relatively new in the fintech world.\n\nYou may also need to understand the buying and selling process and find ways to optimize your resources. With some knowledge and practice, any investor can gain confidence dealing in the NFT market, making it possible to grow money and strengthen your investment portfolio.\n\nWith this in mind, the best time to take action is now, while it’s still early, so you can discover what the world of NFT has in store for you.\n",

      title: "Ice hockey sports betting: Why is Bitcoin getting popular there?",
      content: "Crypto sports betting is becoming more popular with each day that goes by, and it’s no wonder why. While punters still buy tickets for the actual games at their local ice rink (though there are plenty who prefer crypto), this new way of paying for fun aspects like wagering on your favourite team has several important advantages.\n\nIn the crypto sports betting scene, Bitcoin (BTC) is among the top echelon of coins that a lot of punters rely on the most.\n\nWhile beginners may still find it challenging to bet on their favourite sport using BTC, crypto payments are far more convenient for the entertainment businesses. Payment processing on blockchain is decentralized, it doesn’t run through an organization and therefore the business doesn’t have to worry about high “scrub rates”, or chargeback rates.\n\nIf there’s a sport in the world that can take advantage of Bitcoin betting right now, it’s definitely ice hockey. Reportedly, the social media sensation Pavel Barber is using Bitcoin on ice hockey teams and players.\n\nAdvantages of using Bitcoin in sports betting\n\nThere are a lot of benefits when using Bitcoin as your go-to coin when betting on the most exciting ice hockey games. If you want to win a lot of your wagers, then do so with the most reliable coin in the world!\n\n\n  \n    Initial deposit bonuses\n\n    If you are looking for huge deposit bonuses, then you should go with Bitcoin. Sportsbooks are trying to incentivize people to learn handling crypto, as explained earlier, and the best tool for that are bonuses.\n\n    To be quite honest, depositing using your conventional credit or debit cards at the sportsbook of your choice will most likely grant you bonuses as well.\n\n    But if you deposit Bitcoin, the maximum limit tends to be loads higher and your sportsbook will most probably match 100% of your deposits giving you enormous bonuses.\n  \n  \n    Top-notch privacy and speed\n\n    Part of Bitcoin’s blockchain features is providing anonymous transactions, or “pseudonymous” as is the correct term. You are guaranteed that there is no third party involved in the transaction. That is what provides the anonymity and results in reduced fees.\n\n    Also, crypto transfers go through on bank holidays just the same as on any other day.\n  \n  \n    Lower costs\n\n    Why do Bitcoin transactions cost less? The absence of a third party and other miscellaneous costs like salaries of accountants help make the transaction fees very cheap and even faster than the traditional financial intermediaries and institutions.\n\n    The transaction costs often way less than what a bank would charge you, especially if you are depositing abroad.\n  \n\n\nDrawbacks of using Bitcoin in sports betting\n\nThe major bottleneck when it comes to adoption of crypto for sports betting is that a lot of punters get intimidated by new tech tools like Bitcoin. But that doesn’t really have to be the case. Instead, Bitcoin’s concept is actually quite simple.\n\nBitcoin is one of the many cryptocurrencies on the market. As a cryptocurrency, it is a decentralised digital asset that functions as a medium of exchange that provides a store of values. Bitcoin is considered as the highest valued crypto as it is one of the pioneers of the digital assets industry.\n\nWith a dedicated decentralised blockchain, Bitcoin can provide faster and more secure transactions that also provide anonymity when the value transfer carries over on the internet.\n\nIn other words, it’s perfect for online sports betting, especially if there are large sums of money are involved.\n\nThis also means that there are no central authorities controlling the process of how each transaction will take place since a network of users all take charge of the minting and distribution systems.\n\nIce hockey betting markets\n\nNow that you have a solid foundation on why Bitcoin works so well in sports betting, let’s  take a quick look at the ice hockey betting markets. There are several markets you can delve into when betting.\n\nBelow are some of the most profitable ones that you should take a closer eye on:\n\n\n  \n    Moneyline\n\n    Moneyline bets are the most conventional types of markets seen across all sports. All you have to do is bet on who you think will win the game. If you wagered on the winning team, you win the moneyline bet.\n  \n  \n    Goal spread\n\n    Similar to the baseball run line, a goal spread is a betting market where you base your bets on which team you think will score particular sets of goals in a period. This is based on a 1.5 goal spread, where you can bet on either the favourites to lay 1.5 goals or the underdogs to do the same.\n  \n  \n    Total goals\n\n    Total goals are also easy to understand where you’ll just guess how many goals are scored by both teams added up. If you guessed the closest to the outcome of both teams’ scored goals, you win the wager.\n  \n\n\nFinal words\n\nAs you can see, there is a lot of potential for you to win a ton of wagers when betting with Bitcoin on your favourite ice hockey team or player like Pavel Barber. There are several important advantages to using Bitcoin at a sportsbook. Now might just be the time to fully embrace your inner punter and win a ton of games while you’re at it!\n",

      title: "ScriptSpotlight: Kalman Filters on Tradingview",
      content: "Kalman filter is a recursive algorithm that was developed to track a moving target and predict its future value. Its advantage is that it doesn’t ignore noise and statistical errors, instead it uses them as a part of its predictive estimate.\n\nThe filter has been widely used in navigation and engineering, but it has been no less useful in the asset management industry.\n\nIn any finance-related field, Kalman will usually be applied to a time series of data - and not just price data, it could be any economic performance indicators.\n\nIn trading and technical analysis particularly, the Kalman filter is used as a smoothing tool that offsets some of the lag that smoothing indicators usually have.\n\nIf you even chart, that should tell you that Kalman filter will do better than a moving average, if your goal is to smooth out price action with as little lag as possible.\n\nHere’s a paper that documents a backtest of four different Kalman filter strategies.\n\nKalman filters on TradingView\n\nKalman filters have of course made it to TradingView’s public library. I’ve picked and reviewed the one script that I thought would be best to show off the basics.\n\nIf you want to explore the library yourself, do search for both “Kalman” as well as the alternative spelling “Kahlman” - there is a bunch of scripts under each of them.\n\nKalman Filter by Loxx in the Public Library\n\nThe Kalman Filter script by Loxx is just a transcript of MT4’s Kalman Filter done in pine script to make it compatible with TradingView.\n\nOn the charts it looks pretty much like a well-smoothed moving average, except it doesn’t lag:\n\n\n\nTradingView’s BTCUSD on 9 Aug 2022 with Kalman Filter by Loxx\n\nOther than that, this pine script was updated to change colour based on “velocity”, a part of the Kalman formula that you won’t find in moving averages.\n\n\n\nIn Kalman used in technical analysis, velocity says how fast the price changes from candle to candle, and in which direction.\n\nWhen the price decreases over time, the velocity component of Kalman will be negative. When that trend reverses, it will turn positive. In theory the change in velocity could point you to price reversals.\n\nI find that on crypto markets, the velocity change lags, and that even on 5M timeframes. I looked at BTCUSD, ETHUSD, SOLUSD and their ratios, in the default settings it always lags.\n\nWhen I increased the K value, which is used as a multiplier of velocity in this formula, it led to an improvement with lag but as it happens, it also started giving more false signals. The velocity would flip back and forth when market wasn’t really trending.\n\nIn forex, where Kalman is used a lot, the velocity lags as well but you end up losing less money through it as the forex markets’ moves are not as sharp as they are in crypto. A long way ahead until we get that sort of conditions!\n\n\n\nEither way, even forex traders recommend Kalman filter mainly for confirmation of trends and price dynamics.\n\nAs for that, Kalman filter is already an effective trend tracker in crypto markets. For that purpose it works well for both short-term charts as well longer time frames. Below is the weekly BTCUSD chart with Kalman filter in default settings.\n\nYou will still the most value if you combine it with a good momentum indicator such as RSI and its transformations.\n\n\n\nKalman Filter by Loxx in the Public Library\n\nThere are other combos out there too, of course. For one, you can also use pine script strategies that combine advanced moving averages like Hull MA with Kalman filters to improve your trend tracking. The linked post includes one that is in the TradingView public library.\n",

      title: "Relief Rally: Is Altcoin Season Happening This Year?",
      content: "With the ongoing rise in cryptocurrency prices, some began wondering if we will see a full-blown “alt season” soon.\n\nThe answer to that question may not be as positive as you would wish but there have been some interesting trends emerging from across crypto communities.\n\nIs the relief rally sparking interest in altcoin trading?\n\nThe alt season is the jargon term for a period in the crypto markets where some altcoins start gaining, which leads to a price surge and growth in valuations all over the altcoin sector.\n\nSome analysts use a formal definition: An altcoin season begins when the performance of three quarters of the top 50 cryptocurrencies is superior to that of Bitcoin.\n\nThis can happen right after the price of Bitcoin experiences a bull run, or on the contrary when Bitcoin has stayed flat for a long time.\n\nAlthough any claims of a bull run are very debatable right now, it is a fact that Bitcoin just had its best month in all of 2022, this past July, after recouping almost 18% of the value it has lost since the end of of January.\n\nPast Alt Seasons\n\nThere have been several altcoin seasons since the first one in 2017, at least according to past price history. Some analysts think that this year's alt gains, should they happen at all, could possibly be quite short but greater than the previous ones due to the current perception that (once again) Bitcoin is irrelevant. The catalyst is meant to be Ethereum’s merge and Solana’s network upgrades.\n\nSome altcoins seem to be having the best time of their lives as their performance has been incredible all around this year. The Altcoin news today which was making headlines back in April was that the altcoin season was to begin at any given moment according to the alt season index.\n\nThe alt season index, which you can find at blockchaincenter.net/altcoin-season-index, looks as poised as it did in April. It seemed that the only thing missing was just a spark.\n\nHowever, the next altcoin news to hit back then was the collapse of the Terra ecosystem, which set off a market-wide collapse that caused the value of all cryptocurrencies to drop below the $1 trillion threshold.\n\nWhat followed was an increase in Bitcoin's market share, which rose by 48% to a 10-month high. A Bitcoin season, sometimes dubbed the Return of the King in trading communities, looked imminent until a steady rebound of altcoins over the next three months threw it into a bearish pull for more than a month.\n\nThe plans for an altcoin season took a hit as a result, but that just happened to be nothing but just a delay. Altcoins entered a recovery phase, which was attributed to over-the-counter trading with other whales through custody services.\n\nAccording to some reports, mid-cap altcoins emerged as the biggest gainers in the market last month. Data information revealed that the returns for the Mid Cap Index came out to 40%, which is the highest figure of all the indexes by a large margin.\n\nThe Small Cap Index came in second, racking in 30% returns for the month of July 2022, even though it was expected to take the first spot. Although Bitcoin also experienced double-digit gains of 17%, the figure was far less than its smaller peers.\n\nAltcoins' performance this year has seen Bitcoin's market dominance fall by 0.22%, whiles Stablecoin's market share has also dropped by 0.48 percent, 0.49 percent, and 0.14 percent for USDT, USDC, and BUSD, respectively.\n\nThe reported figures also give an indication that the market is once again experiencing positive confidence and that investors, both newbies, and veterans, are no longer rushing to buy safe-haven assets.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nThis current rise in altcoin activity could either be the delayed spark needed to launch the altcoin season, or just a transitory relief rally.\n\nSome experts believe that upcoming altcoin projects in the crypto exchanges and crypto hedge fund liquidation will contribute to an increase in altcoin volatility.\n",

      title: "Opinion: Blockchain-based provenance is futile even for digital art",
      content: "Provenance, or verification of authenticity , has been around ever since blockchain technology became a catchphrase. These days, different flavours of verification techniques are talked about a bit more once again, as the NFT art industry is reaching more adoption.\n\nAuthenticity is of paramount importance to art collectors. It stands to reason that authentic NFTs with a verifiable history should have higher prices. But users will need to authenticate all sorts of digital assets. This applies to anything obtainable, including retroactive airdrops, art, music, game collectibles and even premium domain names.\n\nProvenance in art vs crypto\n\nIn the art world, the term \"provenance\" is used to refer to the ownership history of a painting or other work of art. Provenance or authenticity can take many forms, including certificates of authenticity, photographic evidence, auction records, etc.\n\nWithin the world of crypto and blockchain, provenance has more or less the same meaning.\n\nBecause public blockchains are an open record, confirming the truthfulness of history of any resource should in theory be a straightforward process.\n\nBut in practice that’s not the case since you need to introduce smart contracts.\n\nSmart contracts are the off-base apparatus for resource tokenization. They are the industry standard, but their critics claim that they are pointlessly complex, wasteful and costly when it comes to making and exchanging advanced assets.\n\nComplexity always opens the door to vulnerabilities that can lead to hacks or rampant fraud. I won't go into the precise subtle elements of what it takes to verify an advanced resource inside a smart contract since, in all honesty, it's a futile exercise.\n\nAnd I believe that’s part of the problem. Smart contracts are incomprehensible to the average individual, which means hardly anybody is able to find meaningful data about their fungible and non-fungible tokens using public blockchain explorers. People need to outsource analyzing of the code and the metadata to blockchain audit companies, but they cannot even judge whether the service did a good job or not.\n\nAll in all it’s all very similar to the classic marketing practices that run only on first impressions: In most of business these days, to accelerate the initial results, most entrepreneurs buy real Instagram followers and other involvement metrics. This allows to create a trusted first impression, raise the brand status and increase the retention rate of new users. And it works.\n\nDAOs are unlikely to make an impact\n\nIf blockchain provenance is futile, it means that there is no decentralized independent organization (DAO) that has the power to change the way business and marketing works, not even in the NFT art industry.\n\nDAOs are created with the intention of providing a product or service, but they have no direct authority over the thing they’re providing and marketing. Everything the DAO does must be approved by the majority of the token holders who have voting rights. In theory that sounds very democratic, in practice the process is slow and clunky and thus the power to effect change is limited.\n\nIn the case of blockchain provenance, this means that no matter how well-intentioned a DAO may be, it will most likely never be able to truly have an impact on the art market.\n\nAnd maybe that’s a good thing. The presence of middlemen is what gives the art market its stability and liquidity. Without them, the market would be much less efficient and would likely grind to a halt with the first hiccup.\n\nConclusions\n\nIn the world of art, authenticity is everything. A painting by a well-known artist is worth far more than a painting by an unknown artist, even if the two paintings are identical in every other way.\n\nThe same is true for digital assets. An authentic NFT with a verifiable history will always be worth more than an NFT with no such history. This is because authenticity adds value to an asset by establishing its provenance. When it comes to authentication, the burden of proof lies with the user.\n\nIn order to prove that an NFT is authentic, users will need to provide evidence of its history and popularity, and that’s not a piece of cake. Any form of authenticity verification is not likely to ever be fully automated, no matter how far the technology advances. Just see how easy it is to buy Instagram followers in this industry, and how well that works.\n",

It makes sense, since you are only focusing on future gains, if you are long-term bullish.\n\nThis strategy also works well because there’s no need for any guesswork, just buy at regular intervals. This is what makes DCA one of the most common trading strategy for people to automate.\n\nFTX.com has a geeky tool similar to a command line where you can set up weekly DCA for free, and here’s the recipe.\n\nBut if you want to set up your automation in a drag-and-drop app, Coinrule is the platform.

Doing that you can set up your bot to not just buy regularly, but also buy low.\n\nHere’s what it looks like:\n\n\n\nIn Coinrule, this is still branded as a DCA bot template but in fact, if you set it up right, it really is a dip-buying bot.\n\nYou don’t need to buy the dip manually, the bot will check the markets regularly for you and decide whether they’re dipping enough based on a technical indicator. Coinrule provides a strategy tester along with their 150 pre-made templates, by the way.\n\nMore tool updates coming soon.\n\n\n  Coinrule gives up to 25% off annual plans until the end of September 2022.\n  Get extra 5% fee off at FTX.com with code altcointrading, or altcointradingUS on FTX.us\n\n",

      title: "Which CEX Platforms Are Creative Enough To Make It Out Well Through The Bear?",
      content: "A bear market is a term often used to describe the current markets. Yahoo Finance has called July 2022 an early-stage bull market, but there are not many institutions that share this retail optimism.\n\nBear market is defined as a period of time when stock prices are falling and investors are pessimistic about the future direction of the market.\n\nOne of the “hindsight is 20/20” indicators of an approaching crypto bear is when major cryptos reach their peak and begin to fall. But there is always much discussion whether the peak was final or whether it was just a reaccumulation range.\n\nThere are other factors, though - these include an increase in margin levels, decrease of interest in apps, games or exchanges and deterioration in economic fundamentals.\n\nThe latter influences crypto as well. Speculative institutional traders need to have easy access to money to speculate and, apparently, entrepreneurs need to have access to cheap funding to pay for marketing.\n\nEnter creative marketing practices\n\nThat’s what everyone got used to doing, at least. The amount of projects started without venture capital is small and pretty much limited to niches that are off-putting to startup investors.\n\nIf you are in crypto and ever use any platform that is even vaguely centralised, you should monitor who is making it through the thin times well. In my opinion, crypto platforms that are able to pull off creative marketing practices will be the safest ones you can deal with for this year and beyond.\n\nThere are some classic choices when it comes to staying power.\n\n\n\nBitfinex has just announced they are making Santiment metrics available for free to all traders.\n\nSantiment is a tokenized crypto project that has been around for years. They started off by collecting sentiment data, but the services have expanded since. Santiment is now one of the very few platforms that offers some data on NFT trading.\n\nIf you don’t want to pay 300 USD a month for Nansen and are just happy with the basics, you can now get a free 30 day trial of Santiment by getting an account at Bitfinex. See if the data is useful and after the trial runs out, Sanbase monthly fee is only 44 USD.\n\n\n\nMake a no-KYC account at Bitfinex and then click the ‘S’ icon in the price box to access Santiment\n\nTrading NFTs can be a profitable niche right now, if you have the guts for that illiquid market and its wash trading setups. Either way, trading NFTs will be harder to regulate than most of what’s called DeFi right now. Whether you care for the art at all or not, it’s important to at least consider its presence.\n\n\n\nNFT airdrops are a big deal right now, probably because they are so cheap to set up. The tripwire of the week are NFTs needed as an entrance ticket to Play2Earn projects or as a whitelist token for future airdrops.\n\nAnd then there are the CEX platforms that gamify everything, such as Phemex.\n\nEvery week they run a quiz that forces you to look up and learn information about a new memecoin or a staking coin that is just being launched. If you get all five questions right, you get the airdrop. These quizzes are pretty popular - we post them every Wednesday on Medium and people click them like mad. I’m sure things are looking up for Phemex.\n\nFinal words\n\nTo wrap it up, there are three primary characteristics of a bear market: price depreciation, selling and widespread pessimism.\n\nBear markets also tend to coincide with economic cycles, with the sharpest downturns typically occurring midway through the cycle - not at the beginning and not at the end.\n",

      content: "Throwing crypto at all sorts of games and entertainment is becoming more popular by the day.\n\nThere are game sections at all sorts of DeFi platforms and exchanges like Phemex and CEX gamify crypto airdrops, but OG dice games are still prevalent in this market.\n\nWhy are dice games so successful\n\nLike the best crypto &amp; Bitcoin slot sites, platforms that host dice games are such a hit in the entertainment business because of how easy they make it for people to start playing.\n\nThe rules are straightforward too. While the details vary from site to site, the underlying game is pretty much always the same. Your job is to predict the random outcome of a dice roll, and wager whatever amount of cryptocurrency you feel comfortable putting at risk.\n\nThe fact that you can use crypto is one of the important simplifications. Bitcoin is the preferred asset in the entertainment industry but there have been altcoin dice games ever since Ethereum got known enough. So, you just choose the fastest transacting coin that is available, make a deposit and play within a few minutes.\n\nWho’s doing this?\n\nThere are a couple of established casino operators that provide dice games available to crypto holders.\n\nTwo of the top contenders are Bitstarz and mBit Casino, both of which have been around for almost a decade and so can be trusted to deliver a fair, consistent experience for all players.\n\nThere are also newer brands such as Bspin and Betplay which have gained attention for providing a plethora of casino games, not just dice. The variety is what brings them a lot of traffic as some people get bored of dice quickly.\n\nFor those players there are slots, roulette, blackjack and other games always ready right on the same platform that they are already used to.\n\nWhat keeps people interested?\n\nIn the most basic form of a dice game, you only need to guess whether the dice will land on a number that's higher or lower than a given range.\n\nThe more specific and targeted your bet, the greater the potential payout, which is of course contrasted against the longer odds of this actually happening.\n\nTo some this is just adding complexity to a good entertainment, but other players enjoy figuring out how to work with the modifications.\n\nAnd then there are the bonuses. Just like low-cap crypto exchanges incentivise engagement, crypto gambling operators that run dice games incentivise sign-ups with attractive bonuses for new players.\n\nA popular example would be the so-called “deposit matching”, a bonus that gets your first deposit doubled on your account.\n\nDice bonuses usually run on the same terms as other casino bonuses: Users have to play with that money for a while before they are allowed to withdraw. This is of course great for user retention.\n\nLast point is related to the technology that powers crypto entertainment, especially if it runs on a decentralized app. Some gaming dApps were built with transparency in mind, exposing parts of their inner workings to the outer world.\n\nThis minimizes the chances of manipulation taking place and gives players a sense of confidence that fairness is part of the gambling process. This is part of the ethos of the whole crypto movement.\n\nSome even say that the house edge in crypto-powered entertainment platforms is lower than at traditional ones. The rumour has it that crypto casinos can afford to do this because they don't have the same costs as traditional sites with old school deposit options.\n\nThe importance of playing dice games responsibly\n\nI will leave you with a word on responsible playing. If you do decide to go ahead and sign up to a crypto casino to play dice games using Bitcoin or any other token, be aware that you are putting your money at risk.\n\nDice is a game of chance and the probability of your losing is high. Those who have carefully accumulated crypto assets over months and years shouldn't risk it all on the roll of a dice.\n\nHowever, if you gamble responsibly and only bet amounts that you can cope with losing, it can be a fun time no matter your level of experience.\n",

The fact is that the attention has shifted to short term plays in low cap cryptos and at least in terms of new users, small exchanges that offer a lot of penny coins are winning.

The niche they are focusing on most strongly are memecoins - Bitforex is where all the original DOGE clones were listed during their heyday.\n\nIt seems that Bitforex is being overlooked in the market.

This looks like a geo preference rather than anything else, the exchange is not doing anything super interesting or innovative. The highest traffic search queries are on buying Shiba Inu or Nano without KYC.\n\n\n\nPrimeXBT is a winner that was surprising to me, but at a closer look they seem to be getting most of their traffic to their blog where they feature price predictions for various established altcoins. The exchanges considered winners here have most of their high traffic keywords pointing directly to markets.\n\nLatoken\n\n\n\nLatoken is one of the fast growing dens for web3 penny crypto. They actually claim they are the fastest growing one, which doubt, as you’ll see below.\n\nLatoken specializes in listing small altcoins that you can’t find on other exchanges, they don’t require KYC, run airdrops on platform and all their listed coins are paired with a crypto - usually USDT, BTC and ETH.\n\nThe interface is really made for penny crypto traders.\n\nYou can list out markets based on data such as niche (Web3, GameFi, NFT) or whether the coin has VC backing. There is a paragraph with basic data about each coin right on platform. This way you can skim through altcoins in a niche that interests you and get the idea without doing a lot of extra research.\n\n\n\nTrading fees are not outrageously high on Latoken, but one of the catches is the withdrawal fee which is really out of proportion.\n\nThe withdrawal fee is the reason why Latoken wasn’t listed in the list of platforms where you can trade between USDT and USDC, even though Latoken has that market and does not require KYC for it. However, the USDT withdrawal fee on Binance chain gets up to 15 USDT whereas on Phemex you will pay usually less than 1 USDT.\n\nPhemex\n\n\n\nJudging from organic traffic estimates, Phemex is the winner among the centralised exchanges that specialize in low cap altcoins. They are building a pretty successful knowledge base which is responsible for some of the traffic gains but overall the are getting most of their traffic directly to trading pairs.\n\nIt’s true that Phemex is clever with their marketing. They run a lot of giveaways and airdrops to promote their newly listed coins, they run special promos on their locked staking accounts and the UI has the same kind of visual spam notifications as Binance, popping up all the time: They are annoying but they keep people engaged.\n\nThe promos and airdrops started happening regularly as well, which always works great for building a loyal user base. Phemex is certainly not run by amateurs.\n\nAs Latoken, Phemex is a crypto-only exchange - all pairs are crypto or stablecoins. While they do not list as much of super low cap crypto as Latoken, trading on Phemex is cheaper and withdrawals as well.\n\n\n\nPhemex trades perps as well, so to get your markets filtered by niche you need to first click through to the list of spot markets. The categories Phemex runs include Metaverse, Infra, Memecoins, NFT blockchains and more. The “Details” button gives you a quick rundown on the coin’s value proposition.\n\nIn my opinion, Latoken’s filter is more user-friendly because it only takes a few seconds to find coins that are relevant to niche. On Phemex you need to hover or click to get more details about a coin.\n\nOn the other hand, trading there is overall a better experience and it’s really cheap. If you’ve read the guide on trading between stablecoins, you’ll have seen that exchanging USDT for USDC on Phemex takes literally 10 minutes including deposit and withdrawal, the fee is next to nothing - and that’s without KYC.\n\nFinal words\n\nIf the market has spoken, then Latoken and Phemex are clearly the places to be if you want to trade low cap altcoins in niches like Web3, Metaverse or GameFi.\n\nI want to recommend the following: Latoken is a great place to quickly find out which low-cap coins interest you, but before depositing, head over to Phemex. It might not have as many penny stocks in its list compared with Latoken, but it’s worth checking out if your market is listed.\n",

      title: "How Will Metaverse Shake Up Tech Businesses?",
      content: "Metaverse is the latest big thing technology and is making waves in multiple industries. As much as Metaverse is still yet to launch, it has attracted significant investor interest. Some pump resources to Metaverse NFT projects, as is well seen from our airdrops page; others adjust their business to accommodate with Metaverse once it is here.\n\nAs a crypto investor, it’s best to know how best to position yourself to get the most out of the technology and its influence on the markets.\n\nSince Metaverse revolves mostly around entertainment, the gaming industry is leading the way, and even online gambling platforms like Ripper Casino are embracing blockchain technology in their operations. They are at the front row of the new technology and should be the first industry to take advantage of this incredible opportunity.\n\nDoes Metaverse have opportunities for businesses in other industries? If all the promises of Web3 and Metaverse will come true, big and small businesses will experience the same shift as in the gaming industry. Like mobile, Metaverse might provide a level playing field for everyone and increase opportunities for all businesses.\n\nHere are ways the Web3 technology that Metaverse relies on may revolutionize businesses.\n\n\n  \n    Improved Customer Experience\n\n    In Snowcrash, the cyberpunk book that first used the term Metaverse, businesses optimised their customer experience by using artificial intelligence staff with avatars that would adjust based on the customer’s appearance.\n\n    This way every customer would get to speak to a staff member that looked kind of like them, which in the book improved customer satisfaction.\n\n    It is the reality that businesses are always looking to improve their competitiveness by enhancing their customer experience. In today's business environment, customers have the power. This means customer experience is vital to the growth and sustainability of your business. A positive customer experience boosts brand awareness, loyalty, and revenue.\n\n    Metaverse will definitely provide new tools and approaches to driving positive customer experiences. Even without AI, companies can showcase their products through VR and AR technologies. The experience will be more detailed but also more impressive to help customers make purchasing decisions easily.\n  \n  \n    Marketing and Brand Awareness\n\n    Organizations are also set to benefit from marketing and brand awareness in the Metaverse. The possibilities are endless. Some brands have already made a move and collaborated with game developers in the Metaverse. Some fashion brands have, for instance, partnered with NFT game developers to have their collections featured in the games. There are many strategies businesses could use to make their brands visible in the Metaverse.\n\n    For instance, there are opportunities for real estate businesses to showcase their brands and build authority in the virtual world.\n\n    They can build landmarks, houses, and even malls on Metaverse platforms and put up banners. They can also place adverts in Metaverse to increase their reach.\n\n    Different businesses and brands will get a broad space to advertise their products and services, build relationships and reach international markets. People are already doing things online. The preference for e-commerce is growing, and Metaverse and businesses can tap into existing opportunities to diversify their marketing strategies.\n\n    \n  \n  \n    New Payment Methods\n\n    To join Metaverse, you will need to have a crypto wallet and use some form of cryptocurrencies and digital assets, if only for your avatar.\n\n    Metaverse will let consumers and businesses access new payment methods thanks to the Web3 technology that powers it.\n\n    It is a fully virtual world, which means there will be businesses, individuals and bots that will be transacting in cryptocurrency.\n\n    That cryptocurrency might be centralised or decentralised, that is not yet certain. Either way, people will buy and sell fully virtual goods in Metaverse, meaning that a fully virtual payment method would be more convenient to support that trade.\n\n    Through blockchain, businesses and consumers can transact without incurring extra expenses like exchange rate fees and using intermediaries.\n  \n  \n    Increased Collaboration and Networking\n\n    The Covid-19 pandemic made businesses realize their teams could work on projects without being in the same office. There have been a plethora of tools used by companies to hold meetings, work on projects and run their operations.\n\n    Metaverse will streamline collaboration and networking and establish more refined models for running businesses. Metaverse technologies will create more opportunities for collaboration, which will steer business growth and success.\n\n    If Metaverse actually catches on, it would not be too far-fetched to conclude that air travel might actually start getting obsolete. Business meetings in Metaverse could be the environmentally friendly alternative.\n\n    It would be a convenient virtual world where employees can interact and work. Tech companies like Microsoft are already leading the way in creating collaborative platforms like Mesh that allow employees to collaborate in the same room through holograms and 3D avatars.\n\n    Through avatars enabled by Metaverse, the genuine feel of online meetings should improve as it will make them more immersive. Online meetings would feel less like conventional virtual meetings and feel more like you have people sitting in the room.\n  \n  \n    Increased Revenue\n\n    Technology has, over time, proved to be a significant driver of growth. Most of the benefits that come with running a business in the Metaverse improve the profitability of companies.\n\n    For instance, through collaboration on Metaverse platforms, businesses can meet with partners in different locations. This will reduce travel expenses. Through remote work, companies will cut down overhead costs.\n\n    Through increased reach to markets beyond your geographical borders, you will experience a boost in sales.\n  \n\n\nFinal words\n\nMetaverse is around the corner, and it is only a matter of time before it becomes part of our day-to-day activities. As a crypto investor, it’s best to know how best to position yourself to get the most out of the technology and its influence on the markets.\n",

      title: "Tax Implications of Crypto: 5 Things You Should Know",
      content: "If you’ve been making use of the discount prices of everything non-essential and bought cryptocurrencies, it's important to understand the tax implications you’re facing.\n\n\n\nCryptocurrencies are not considered legal tender in the United States, so any gains or losses from their sale are treated as capital gains or losses.\n\nThis means that you owe the IRS a report of any profits or losses and the taxes on them.\n\nBut the 2022 reality is that now that DeFi and staking exists, cryptocurrencies may in fact be subject to capital gains tax, income tax, or GST. Keep reading for a list of tips.\n\n\n  \n    Do I have to pay tax from staking yields, crypto bounties and crypto airdrops?\n\n    Right now, the IRS does not provide info on how to tax staking rewards. Accountants recommend treating staking yields the same way as crypto airdrops:\n\n    \n      Crypto airdrops are taxable in the same way as a freelance income, but only if the rewarded token could be freely traded at the moment of distribution. (Revenue Ruling 2019-24)\n    \n\n    This means that crypto staking earnings should be reported as a freelance income if you earned a cryptocurrency that was trading on crypto exchanges and could be sold.\n\n    The IRS wants you to report airdrop and staking profits at the exchange rate of the day when you received your reward and you get taxed whether you actually sold the token or not.\n  \n  \n    What is the capital gains tax rate for cryptocurrencies?\n\n    The capital gains tax rate for cryptocurrencies is the same as the capital gains tax rate for other investments. You are liable to pay capital gains if you trade cryptocurrencies or if you sold your cryptocurrency after holding it for some time.\n\n    The capital gains tax rate is the percentage of the profit that you have to pay on your investment when you sell it. If you just hold the crypto without selling it, there is no capital gains tax to pay. If that crypto was staking income or an airdrop, you should pay an income tax of it.\n\n    For most people, the capital gains tax rate will be 20 percent. However, if you are in a higher income bracket, you may have to pay a higher capital gains tax rate.\n  \n  \n    What should I do if I receive a notice of proposed adjustment from the IRS regarding my cryptocurrency taxes?\n\n    If you received a notice of proposed adjustment from the IRS regarding your cryptocurrency taxes, the agency believes you have not been correctly reporting your digital currency transactions. You will need to take action to correct this and may need to pay back taxes, interest, and penalties.\n\n    The first step is to determine exactly what the IRS is proposing. The notice will likely include a summary of your transactions and an estimated tax owed. You will then need to review these calculations and compare them to your own records. You can provide documentation to support your position if there are any discrepancies.\n\n    Once you have determined the accuracy of the notice, you can begin figuring out how much you owe in back taxes, interest, and penalties. This can be a complex process, as cryptocurrencies are still a new asset class, and there is little guidance from the IRS on how they should be taxed. You may want to seek professional help to ensure that you are calculating everything correctly.\n\n    If you agree with the proposed adjustments, you must submit payment for the amount owed. If you disagree or cannot pay immediately, you can request a Collection Due Process hearing to try and reduce or eliminate the amount owed.\n  \n  \n    How can I use tax return folders for storing my records?\n\n    You can ensure your cryptocurrency transactions are organized by using physical tax folders. It helps to quickly and easily identify the important documents that make up each cryptocurrency tax return.\n\n    \n\n    Here are some general tips on how to use tax return folders to store your crypto records:\n\n    \n      Create a folder for each year's return.\n      Label the folder with the year the return was filed.\n      Print all of the transaction  needed to support the return.\n      Store the folder in a safe place.\n    \n\n    It's a good idea to keep copies of your tax returns and supporting documents for a few years. That way, you'll have them if you need to reference them for future tax years.\n  \n  \n    What are crypto on-ramps and do they have any special tax implications?\n\n    A crypto on ramp is a digital platform that allows users to buy and sell crypto easily. They can also be used to store cryptocurrencies in a digital wallet. Crypto on-ramps make it easy for people to get into or out of the cryptocurrency market.\n\n    The tax implications of using crypto on-ramps vary from country to country, but it’s usually the same as for trading on crypto exchanges. In most countries, there is a capital gains tax on profits from selling cryptocurrencies.\n  \n\n\nFinal Words\n\nThe tax implications of owning cryptocurrencies are important to understand. Depending on your country of residence and how you use your cryptocurrencies, you may be subject to different tax treatments. It's important to seek professional advice to ensure you are paying the correct amount of tax on your cryptocurrency holdings.\n",

      title: "NFT Trading: Driven by celebrity hype but open to everyone",
      content: "Trading NFTs has become wildly popular over the past few years.\n\nWith the rise of crypto trading, it's become prime time for anybody and everybody to get involved in some form of online trading. But out of all crypto trading, trading NFTs is at the moment the least regulated way to engage in crypto trading.\n\nTrading NFTs works the same way that any online trading works. Buyers purchase or bid for a token, then try and sell that token for more money than they bought it for. Basic trade practices, right?\n\nOne big difference with NFT trading is that while the value of an individual NFT is solely based on demand, much like dog money for instance, there are hardly any tools to chart and monitor how the supply and demand for an NFT develops.\n\nThis means that the simplest and seemingly least valuable NFT you can think of, with the right audience, could be worth thousands, if not millions. It also means that the demand by an audience can be relatively easily faked at the moment, which creates a lot of risk for the NFT trader.\n\nWhat Types of NFTs Can You Trade?\n\nAt the superficial glance, the world of NFTs is full of nostalgia, demand, exclusivity, and money.\n\nBut the reality is that there are literally NFTs for anything you can imagine.\n\nThe most popular ones NFTs to trade tend to be sports memorabilia, digital artworks like the Bored Ape, and video game characters. However, NFTs have made their way into pretty much every facet of money making, including adult entertainment. If that got your interest, by all means learn more about poker NFTs. The point is that there doesn't seem to be a place that is untouched by non-fungible tokens.\n\nWith the boom in online trading these days, it was inevitable that something as big as the NFT craze would extend its reach all through the online world.\n\nDecentralized Trading… That runs on hype\n\nThe rise in popularity of NFTs and NFT trading has caused a monumental stir in virtually all spheres of societal life.\n\nThe richest and most powerful men and women in the world have realized the value that resides in the NFT market, especially once they get promoted by a celebrity with a loyal audience. Obviously they've not hesitated to get involved.\n\nNames like billionaire Mark Cuban and influential marketing guru Gary Vee are a few examples of big-time celebs who have purchased NFTs. Even celebrities like Jay-Z and Tom Brady are in on the phenomenon selling their own exclusive collection of NFTs.\n\nThe NFT market doesn't stop at individuals, however. The NBA has even launched its own collection of basketball memorabilia and rarities for fans to purchase, and it's become one of the most popular NFT collections in the world.\n\nCelebrity mentions and hype are very much what drives the hype effect that can drive NFT prices way north.\n\nNFT Trading is Open to Everyone\n\nYou may see all the big-money moves that big-name celebrities are making in the NFT world and think to yourself, I'll never be able to get in on the game.\n\nHowever, NFT trading is actually readily available to pretty much everyone.\n\nIt's also much simpler than you may think - there is no charting, no order books, and right now no KYC.\n\nThe first place to start would be heading over to one of the larger NFT marketplaces, like OpenSea or Rarible. On those you'll find thousands of digital assets to peruse over and decide what interests you. You can purchase whichever ones you want or bid for them in an auction, and they'll become yours to trade, sell, or keep, it's up to you.\n\nOn the other hand, you will often find that NFTs on smaller marketplaces are priced better.\n\nWhat does it take practically to start trading NFTs?\n\nBefore you start flexing your purchasing power, however, you'll first need to get a crypto wallet. This is where you'll store your NFTs.\n\nMost NFTs are on Ethereum, Solana or MATIC blockchains, so it would be wise to get a crypto wallet that can host all of them, like Exodus or Ledger.\n\nOnce you have a crypto wallet, you can simply sign up and create a profile on your choice of NFT marketplace, and then you're good to go.\n\nThere are no KYC forms to fill, as NFT marketplaces are non-custodial dApps, so there’s no need to worry about geopolitical restrictions and utility bills.\n\nYou can simply start buying and selling NFTs like it's nobody's business, or you could hold onto some of the lesser known NFT art tokens and promote them on Instagram to increase their perceived value, much like it is done with traditional art. The choice is yours.\n\nConclusion\n\nNFTs, or Non-Fungible Tokens, have taken the world by storm in recent years, and there doesn't look to be any quelling of their demand anytime soon.\n\nThe best you could do if you want to start trading NFTs is figure out what your niche is, and plug into it. Don't go too crazy, be smart and patient with your tokens, and try to avoid stressing yourself out too much!\n",

      title: "Why CDs are Better Than Money Market Accounts",
      content: "The average rate of return on a money market account is just 0.06%, according to the Federal Reserve. In contrast, the average CD rate is currently around 1.3%. That may not seem like much, but it can make a big difference over time especially if you have a large sum of money invested. Here are a few reasons why CDs may be a better investment than a money market account:\n\nCD Rates are Much Higher\n\nCD rates are usually around 1% higher than the interest rates on money market accounts. This is because CD rates are based on the Prime Rate, which is the rate at which banks lend money to their best customers.\n\nThe Prime Rate is currently 3.25%, so CD rates are currently 4.25%. Money market account rates are based on the Federal Reserve's target rate for overnight loans, which is currently 0.25%. That means that CD rates are currently 4% higher than money market account rates. There are a few reasons why CD rates are better than money market account rates.\n\nFirst, CD rates are guaranteed for the length of the term. That means that if the interest rate goes up, your CD rate will stay the same.\n\nMoney market account rates can change at any time, so you could lose out on earnings if rates go down. Second, CD rates are usually higher than money market account rates. That means you'll earn more interest on your CD than you would on a money market account. And third, CD rates are typically fixed, while money market account rates can be variable. That means you'll know exactly how much interest you'll earn on your CD, which can help you plan your finances.\n\nYou can use a CD as Collateral for a Loan\n\nWhen you want to take out a loan, one option is to use a CD as collateral.\n\nThis can be a good idea if you have good credit and can get a lower interest rate than you would with a secured loan. Plus, you won't have to worry about putting up your home or other assets as collateral.\n\nAnother benefit is that you can still earn interest on your CD even while it's being used as collateral. If you're thinking of using a CD as collateral for a loan, compare CD rates at banks and credit unions first. You'll want to find the institution that offers the best terms.\n\nOnce you've found the right CD, you can use it as collateral for a loan and enjoy the peace of mind that comes with knowing your assets are still working for you.\n\nCD Terms are Flexible\n\nWhen it comes to CD terms, you have much more flexibility than with a money market account. You can choose from a variety of CD terms, ranging from a few months to several years. This means that you can tailor your CD investments to match your financial goals.\n\nFor example, if you're looking for short-term savings, but the money market account you're considering only offers long-term terms, then you may not be able to use the account to meet your needs. CD terms are also generally more flexible than money market account terms when it comes to withdrawals. With a CD, you can usually make one or more withdrawals without penalty during the term of the CD.\n\nWith a money market account, on the other hand, you may be limited in the number of withdrawals you can make, and you may be charged a fee for making withdrawals. This can make it difficult to access your money when you need it.\n\nCD terms are also generally more flexible than money market account terms when it comes to deposits.\n\nWith a CD, you can usually make deposits at any time during the term of the CD. With a money market account, on the other hand, you may be limited in the number of deposits you can make, and you may be charged a fee for making deposits. This can make it difficult to save money in the account.\n\nCDs Typically Have no Extra Fees\n\nInvesting in a CD is a great way to grow your money without having to worry about fees eating into your returns. Unlike money market accounts, which can often have high fees, CDs typically have no fees associated with them.\n\nThis means that you can earn interest on your entire CD balance, rather than just the amount of money left after fees are deducted. This means that CDs can be a great option for people who are looking to grow their money without having to worry about fees eating into their returns.\n\nAnother reason that CDs can be a better option than money market accounts is that CD rates are often much higher than money market rates. This means that you can earn more interest on your CD balance, which can help you to grow your money more quickly.\n\nCDs Offer FDIC Insurance\n\nWhen you invest in a CD at a bank, your money is federally insured against loss of up to $250,000 by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).\n\nMoney market accounts are not federally insured. So if the financial institution where you have your money market account fails, you could lose some or all of your money. In addition to the federal insurance protection offered by CDs, many banks and credit unions offer additional deposit insurance through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA). These government agencies insure deposits up to $250,000 per depositor, per institution.\n\nIf you have more than $250,000 in deposits at one financial institution, you may want to spread your money among several different institutions to make sure it's all insured.\n\nWhile money market accounts have some benefits, CDs offer more flexibility and better interest rates. This makes them a better option for people who are looking to grow their money. Plus, with no fees associated with them, CDs can help you to keep more of your money.\n",

      title: "Benefits And Risks Of Holding Stablecoins",
      content: "Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that are (most often) backed by a pool of real-world assets and aim to maintain a stable fiat value. This makes them an attractive option for crypto traders who want to exit the volatile cryptocurrency markets but without exchanging crypto for fiat.\n\nIn the recent years, stablecoins became the backbone of low-cap crypto trading. Some trading platforms that specialize in small altcoins do not even list fiat markets - LATOKEN and Phemex spot are fully on Tether.\n\nThe rest of the industry followed the demand: KuCoin has extremely limited fiat options and while Binance does support fiat, most of its trading is on their stablecoin markets.\n\nHere we will take a look at the benefits of stablecoins that draw people to them, and risks of holding stablecoins instead of fiat.\n\nWhat made stablecoins so popular?\n\n\n  \n    High Lending Rates\n\n    The first benefit of holding stablecoins is that you can earn a high interest rate on them when compared to traditional fiat currencies.\n\n    This is because stablecoins are blockchain-based assets, which means they can be staked via DeFi protocols.\n\n    As a result, you get high interest rates on stablecoins everywhere - even in interest yielding schemes on centralized exchanges, who possibly use DeFi staking behind the scenes.\n\n    The only equivalent in the industry is lending fiat for margin trading - you can do that on exchanges like Bitfinex. But the yield is nothing like what you can get in stablecoins.\n\n    Additionally, the stablecoin lending rates from popular platforms are obviously much higher than interest rates in banks these days.\n  \n  \n    They can be integrated with smart contracts\n\n    The fact that stablecoins are blockchain-based assets is why they can be integrated with smart contracts. This allows you to use them in a wide variety of DeFi products.\n\n    Most of them are aiming at profit generation and since there is a lot of interest in decentralized trading, the potential to earn is there.\n  \n  \n    They can help you preserve your purchasing power…even in FUD\n\n    Another benefit of holding stablecoins is that they can help you preserve your purchasing power. This is not only because stablecoins are pegged to assets like the US dollar. It’s also because you can relatively easily switch between different stablecoins if you want to.\n\n    Tether is the most widely used stablecoin. In June 2022, Paolo Ardoino has been open on Twitter about attacks on the Tether stablecoin. Tether is an IOU stablecoin that is backed by government bonds and commercial debt. It withstands more withdrawal volume that most TradFi banks would, which shows that a solid backing is likely.\n\n    If the FUD comes and you do have doubts though, it’s easy to exit Tether for USDC. The USDT/USDC market exists on Phemex for instance, and you are not required to KYC to deposit, trade or withdraw stablecoins there.\n  \n  \n    They offer a higher degree of privacy\n\n    Another benefit of holding stablecoins is that they offer a higher degree of privacy. This is because most stablecoins are built on decentralized blockchains like Ethereum.\n\n    This means that your transactions are not subject to the same level of scrutiny as they would be if you were using a traditional fiat currency.\n\n    Additionally, you can now buy stablecoins on P2P platforms without KYC, which may allow you to remain anonymous when making transactions.\n\n    The centralized exchanges Phemex and Bitforex let you trade and withdraw USDT or USDC stablecoins without any KYC.\n\n    If privacy is important to you, stablecoins are a good option.\n  \n  \n    They can be pegged to other assets as well\n\n    Other than stablecoins pegged to fiat, there are also stablecoins are backed by commodities like gold or silver. These can also help to preserve your purchasing power and act as a proxy for investing in precious metals. A big part of precious metal trading does not trade the actual physical metal but a paper anyway.\n  \n\n\nRisks of stablecoins\n\nThe one thing that stablecoin holders rely on is the trust that the stablecoin will keep its peg.\n\nIt's important to note, however, that not all stablecoins are created equal. Some stablecoins may be more vulnerable to depegging than others.\n\nBelow are the main risks of using stablecoins.\n\n\n  \n    Algorithmic stablecoin models can be opaque\n\n    As Deribit Insights explains, there are three types of stablecoins:\n\n    \n      Stables collateralized by USD and USD-generating assets, such as USDC and USDT\n      Stablecoins over-collateralized by pools of crypto assets, such as DAI\n      Algorithmic stablecoins, such as the infamous UST\n    \n\n    Unlike the other two types of stablecoins, algorithmic stablecoins are not redeemable one-to-one for U.S. dollars and usually they are not backed by a collateral either. This means that algorithmic stablecoins can be reflexive, driven by market sentiment. That’s not exactly a good thing in a coin that is meant to be stable.\n\n    The idea of algorithmic stablecoins was to create a replica of fiat money in that people will believe that the stablecoin will maintain its peg, and will trade it back to parity in case of sell offs.\n\n    In reality, most stablecoin users do not have the time and skill to read whitepapers and judge if the logic of the stablecoin is sound at all. This can lead to a belief in a stablecoin that is fundamentally flawed, like it happened with UST.\n  \n  \n    A stablecoin’s collateral is not fully known\n\n    Stables backed by any sort of collateral might seem to shine in comparison here, but the issue with collateral is that it is never fully known.\n\n    Tether is backed by TradFi pool of which only a few vague data points is known: It had a lot of commercial debt, but in 2022 that was changed in favour of government bonds. Also there were private audits several times in the past.\n\n    In other words, source is trust me bro.\n  \n  \n    They are becoming more popular\n\n    As said in the intro in this post, stablecoins are widely used on most crypto exchanges. It is a benefit of stablecoins that they are becoming so popular, but it also lends itself to the fear that comes with every wave of FUD.\n\n    This is because more and more exchanges are relying pretty much only on stablecoins. Additionally, more and more businesses are beginning to accept them as a form of payment.\n\n    This trend is likely to continue as stablecoins become more widely adopted.\n  \n\n\nFinal words\n\nThere are a number of benefits of holding stablecoins. They offer a degree of price stability, they are becoming more popular, and they are supported by most common crypto wallets.\n\nIn P2P trading strategies, stablecoins may be used to lower your trading fees and slightly increase your margins, if you are willing to take the risks.\n\nAdditionally, they can be integrated with smart contracts and offer a higher degree of privacy. If you are looking for a digital asset that is versatile and secure, stablecoins are a good option.\n\nIt's important to be aware of the risks associated with holding stablecoins, however. By knowing the potential risks, you can make a more informed decision about whether or not they are the right tool for you.\n",

      title: "Lipstick and Candy: What could make the lipstick effect during crypto winter?",
      content: " \n\nThe “lipstick effect” is the nickname economists gave to a retail spending pattern that has been observed in most past recessions since the Great Depression of 1930s.\n\nWhen times are tough, consumers stop spending big. But instead of simply not spending on anything that is not necessary, people choose different products to make themselves feel better. Top selling products are things that are relatively cheap, but provide a psychological boost.\n\nSome economists say that part of the decision process is a search for a status symbol. That explains why women go for luxury lipsticks - hence the name of the effect - as lipsticks are reapplied in public places.\n\nBut sometimes the goal is just pure entertainment. That is why cinema tickets and candy also sold well during the Great Depression and quite likely also why bubble gum is a thing.\n\nOne more angle that plays into the recession spending patterns is the perceived shot at a better future. In past recessions that popped up in high lottery ticket sales, and let me tell you, there could be far worse ways for this to manifest than gambling.\n\nSo, let’s do some wild speculation. What might be the products driving the lipstick effect in crypto during the bear market?\n\nHere are four contenders, starting from the least likely one.\n\n\n  \n    Play2Earn for escapism and entertainment\n\n    GameFi has been hit heavily since April with some NFT games losing around 13% their total active users, according to Footprint Analytics.\n\n    In-game tokens and NFTs were a hot commodity a few months back. So it’s not surprising that people get salty when their value drops, especially since they still have to do the same amount of work in earning them.\n\n    With less active users on the play2earn model it becomes much harder for you sell your NFTs as there are no buyers. This creates yet another negative feedback loop and leads to even less interest in play2earn.\n\n    One way to stop the bearish spiral from spreading would be a game so immersive that people would just really want to play it, no matter what.\n\n    That hasn’t happened yet, though, but there is plenty of game development going on.\n  \n  \n    Airdrops for the quick buck\n\n    Crypto airdrops and bounties have been taken as a way to get your hands on some cryptocurrency without investing any money. Airdrops and bounties are the most accessible way to earn crypto - everyone has a smartphone and a Twitter account.\n\n    Both airdrops and bounties are marketing tools. They get released to the community as campaigns and people are to receive tokens or NFTs for as little as signing up or retweeting.\n\n    Crypto bounties ask for a longer commitment, participants are to write blog posts or shill a token on Twitter consistently over a few weeks.\n\n    With the crypto winter starting, the volume of crypto bounties thinned down a lot. They are more expensive to run as they require a campaign manager whereas an airdrop can be dealt with via a Gleam contest or a Google form.\n\n    As a result, you will still get tons of crypto airdrops available right now, especially in DeFi and in NFT gaming.\n\n    It’s hard to say what the future holds for DeFi, but one thing is certain: if people stop believing in its potential then there will be a lot less airdrops. Airdrops are done for marketing, with no public confidence there would be little reason to promote DeFi products.\n\n    As of now though, airdrops are gaining in popularity, if anything.\n  \n  \n    Metaverse as an escape to virtual reality\n\n    Metaverse is still more or less a concept, or as the crypto industry likes to say, a vapourware.\n\n    The idea is to have a decentralized virtual world where you can own your own digital assets and buy or craft your own digital identity. Think of it as a mix of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Second Life. It’s a Web3 platform that runs its backend on blockchain - it uses NFTs for identities, land and properties or as consumer items.\n\n    Everyone in the crypto industry has been quick to jump on the NFT bandwagon when Metaverse started getting promoted. And that makes sense.\n\n    NFTs just as any blockchain-based asset suffers the limitation of being purely virtual. There have been countless altcoin projects to connect a physical object with its representation on blockchain, mostly with the aim of using that for luxury goods or works of art. It hasn’t really worked out.\n\n    But there’s a simple way around the issue: Create a fully virtual world where you can create a status symbol out of a purely digital product and put a price tag on it.\n\n    The marketing for Metaverse has been busy convincing people that this new virtual world will be the future, but so far the skepticism seems to outweigh any excitement.\n\n    If Metaverse does become a hit though, then that would create an enormous market for NFT art and cryptocurrencies in general.\n  \n  \n    Memecoins for both entertainment and a shot at profit\n\n    Random outbursts of Elon Musk shilling DOGE and a lot of additional speculations as to what other meme coins he possibly shills in some his more vague tweets have been the mainstay on cryptotwitter for way longer than would seem reasonable. People love to speculate on penny cryptos, especially if they are exploitable for memes.\n\n    Meme coins are the epitome of pure entertainment and a chance to get in early on something that could pop off. Most meme coins have no utility value and they don’t even pretend to promise any.\n\n    It is true that you can now stake Shiba Inu coin on Binance and elsewhere. That is seen as a value proposition - you can yield staking rewards just for holding SHIB. This however does not change the fact that Shiba Inu is a token with enormous supply, no utility and too high fees and volatility to be used as a currency.\n\n    Tldr; meme coins exist just for the lulz.\n\n    Right now, with the crypto industry mostly sobering up from the hype of the DeFi season of 2021, meme coins and their army of followers are surprisingly more relevant than ever.\n\n    Ever since it became known that there’s money to be made in the crypto industry, it has been hard to find good crypto assets to invest in. Projects that have a sound idea do not take off or lag behind, like Bitcoin, but a random half-functional blockchain becomes the hit. As mentioned in a recent technical analysis post, if you look at the charts and nothing else, you’ll see that the strongest assets of the season were Luna and Solana.\n\n    In turn, there’s a lot of people who are more than happy to opt for gambling on meme coins instead, since it’s all just a show anyway.\n\n    Meme coins are a way to check out and at least have some fun while you might possibly make some money as well.\n\n    Then you just wait until the industry behemoths figure out what’s next.\n  \n\n\nRisk note: Always do your own research, investing in cryptocurrencies is risky.\n\nScam alert for airdrops: There are scam airdrops out there, especially on Facebook and Twitter. If an airdrop form asks you to send in a small amount of tokens to participate, then you know it’s a scam. All genuine airdrops are 100% free. The only thing you stand to lose in a genuine airdrop is the time you spent retweeting if the campaign doesn’t pay you.\n",

      title: "What is a nominee director and why do companies use them?",
      content: "The board of directors is responsible for a company's overall management and strategic direction. It comprises individuals with the necessary skills and experience to provide sound judgment and leadership.\n\nHowever, there may be situations - and not only in the crypto industry - where the anonymity of the actual company director is an important goal.\n\nThis is where a nominee director comes in.\n\nWho Is a Nominee Director\n\n\n  A nominee director is a person appointed by the company directors to act in their place when they are absent.\n  Nominee director is typically appointed for their expertise in an area related to that in which the company trades. It is a person who may not have any prior relationship with the company\n  Nominee director can take on the role of being the public person representing the company, while the other directors remain private.\n\n\nIt appears that the crypto platforms Phemex (Singapore) and Bitforex (Hong Kong) may have opted to use this type of setup.\n\nA nominee director can also be appointed to take on the role of a company director if the original director resigns or dies. Broadly speaking, there are no specific requirements for someone to become a nominee director. Some countries set up specifics in their laws, though. For instance in Hong Kong it calls for any nominee director to have citizenship or permanent residency.\n\nIn most cases, the nominee director will have the skills and experience to take on the company without assistance, if needed. So, a sound choice of nominee director is paramount for good leadership of the company. A good nominee director for Hong Kong business should be able to maintain the anonymity of the actual director, if desired.\n\nHow Are Nominee Directors Useful\n\nAs the global business landscape continues to change and evolve, so too do the types of businesses being set up. This has increased the use of nominee directors, particularly in Hong Kong.\n\nNominee directors can be helpful in several ways. They include:\n\n\n  \n    They Provide Anonymity\n\n    Nominee directors are crucial for companies that want to keep their directors' identities secret for various reasons.\n\n    There are many legitimate reasons why it may be better to hide the identity of a company’s director.\n\n    For example, they may be worried about retaliation from competitors, or they may want to avoid undue public scrutiny.\n\n    This helps a lot when it comes to being safe from competitors in high-competition industries where slander digging out dirt is a common tactic.\n\n    This is not all there is to the function of nominee directors, though.\n  \n  \n    They Provide Continuity for the Company\n\n    Nominee directors can provide continuity for the company if the original directors are absent. It's vital for the company's running and ensures that there are no disruptions in its management or strategic direction.\n\n    There can be several management disruptions that can occur when there is no continuity on the board. It could include things such as:\n\n    \n      Disruptions in the strategic direction of the company\n      Lack of communication or coordination amongst the directors\n      Inability to make decisions or take action\n    \n\n    These disruptions can be costly and time-consuming to fix. As such, it is vital to have a nominee director in place to avoid them.\n  \n  \n    Acting as a Sounding Board for the Other Directors\n\n    A sounding board is a person who gives you impartial feedback and allows you to \"bounce ideas off of them.\"\n\n    This is important for company directors as it allows them to get another perspective on the decisions that they are making. It can also help to avoid groupthink amongst the directors, or conversely, it can avoid miscommunication among them.\n\n    A nominee director can be an excellent sounding board for the other directors. They are usually an expert businessperson with years of experience but at the same time they are not involved in the day-to-day running of the company. This means that they can offer an impartial viewpoint and backing it up with their vast experience.\n  \n  \n    They Can Bring New Skills and Experience to the Company\n\n    Nominee directors can bring more skills to the company. It's vital for companies that want to expand their expertise in a particular area. For example, they may appoint a nominee director with financial expertise to help them with their accounting and financial planning.\n\n    Appointing a nominee director can be an excellent way to expand the skills and experience of the company. They may bring in new perspectives and ideas that the other directors have not previously considered. Additionally, they can help mentor and train the other directors in their areas of expertise.\n  \n  \n    Spreads the Workload of the Directors\n\n    Nominee directors can help to minimize the burden of work among the members. It's essential for companies that have a large number of directors or that have directors with busy schedules. By appointing a nominee director, they can share the company's responsibilities amongst themselves.\n\n    This can be particularly useful for companies going through a period of growth or expanding into new markets. By appointing a nominee director, they can ensure that the workload is spread evenly amongst the directors.\n  \n\n\nTo sum it up, nominee directors can add a lot of value to a company, even if it’s just to protect the other directors from too much public attention. In many cases they add far more tangible value that, though.\n",

      title: "Earning Free Crypto in 2022: List of Opportunities",
      content: "If you want to get into the world of crypto but don’t have any money to invest, there are still good ways to earn crypto.\n\nIn this article, we go over a few ideas to get you started, and then mention a few more ideas for what to do once you have some crypto.\n\n4 Ways to Earn Free Crypto Without Trading or Risking Money\n\n\n  \n    Crypto bounties\n\n    There are many companies and projects that offer bounties for completing certain tasks. These can range from simple things like testing a new feature to more complex tasks like writing an article or creating a video.\n\n    We list some crypto bounties in the airdrops page in their own list. The thing is, most people don’t care for bounties even though you can actually earn a decent money from them. People prefer airdrops because they take less work, even though these days most airdrops are a random draw and not everybody gets paid.\n\n    If you don’t mind the idea of crypto bounties, there is plenty of them. To participate, you just need to have a couple social media accounts with at least few hundred followers and a few accounts on Blogspot or similar.\n  \n  \n    Become a bounty manager\n\n    Another way to earn actually a very good money from crypto bounties is to become the bounty campaign manager. I interviewed a couple of the top bounty managers and some of them did say they earned their first ever crypto from bounty management. All of them treat it as a social media marketing job and earn well from it, without trading or putting any of their money to risk.\n\n    Bounty managers are people who release bounty announcements on crypto outlets, hold the bounty escrow and check the submitted bounty work. They earn a fee for their work and their username collects reputation and merit if the bounties they release pay well and without any hiccups.\n\n    In the interviews, bounty managers mostly agreed that it is important for them to cross check the project that is running the bounty campaign. If you end up posting a scam campaign, your reputation will tank.\n\n    The advantage of being the manager is it pays far better than participating. The disadvantage is you have to have a reputation online, and you need to maintain it.\n\n    Building the reputation can take up to a year to build up. Some people buy used forum accounts to get a head start, but it is still important to maintain it afterwards.\n  \n  \n    Airdrops and Gleam lucky draws\n\n    Crypto airdrops are marketing projects launched when a new token needs to be promoted to the community.\n\n    At AltcoinTrading.NET, we keep a list all upcoming crypto airdrops so that you don’t miss out on any free coins or tokens. If you prefer to get alerts, we post daily airdrop updates in a Medium publication Cryptolounge and you can also subscribe to the airdrop email alerts.\n\n    Crypto airdrops can be done in several ways. The most common airdrop type today is one where you are asked to retweet a bunch of things via a Gleam form or Telegram.  You submit the retweets together with your wallet address in the form and a few weeks later the airdropped tokens should arrive.\n\n    Token Airdrop Spam &amp; Scam Tokens\n\n    The oldest way is to distribute airdropped tokens would be to the holders of a different blockchain asset. This kind of airdrop is not very effective though and these days, it is called “token spam”.\n\n    If you have an ETH or a TRX address, you very likely have some tokens on it visible on Ethereum block explorers that you never heard of.\n\n    That’s token spam. Some of these tokens are fraudulent but most of token spam done as marketing. Here’s one such token. It promotes a website:\n\n    \n\n    Just like with email spam, it is best to be cautious with any unexpected token airdrops. If those spam tokens are worth something and you’ll want to sell them, then first check the transaction in a block explorer. Block explorers like Tronscan clearly mark scam token contracts. If the token is marked as a scam token, just ignore it. Importing that token into your wallet is dangerous.\n  \n  \n    Play to earn games (P2E)\n\n    Play to earn games got really popular with the rise of NFTs. New play to earn games are released all the time and they often promote the launch by doing an airdrop. It pays off to follow the #play2earn hashtag on Medium, as that’s where launches and events always show up.\n\n    In some P2E games you get paid in game tokens for activities that you accomplish in the game. The most common way you get to earn from P2E games is by developing your game character, which is an NFT, and then selling it.\n\n    So, to really earn you need to play a game that is quite popular because you need to have buyers for your character. While there are so many play to earn games, but only a few of them are actually really popular.\n\n    Polygon is the platform to watch\n\n    The most popularized P2E games as of June 2022 are Axie Infinity (ETH), The Sandbox (MATIC), Gods Unchained (ETH), Pegaxy (MATIC).\n\n    The MATIC blockchain is the one Web3 platform to watch right now, the GameFi industry on Polygon is booming.\n\n    On the other hand, all of GameFi is getting collectively slaughtered by the crypto bear market. As all of crypto costs less and less now, you will end up putting in the same amount of work developing your NFT game character but it will sell for a lot less, if at all - the numbers of active users are dropping as well, in some games quite dramatically.\n\n    \n  \n\n\nOnce you get some crypto: Hodl it or stake it\n\nIf you already have some crypto, you can stake it to earn more crypto. Staking is a process that involves holding your coins in a wallet to help verify transactions on the blockchain and in return, you earn a reward.\n\nBecause staking requires you to leave your coins in a wallet for some time, you should avoid custodial services and custodial crypto exchanges to stake your crypto. Custodial earn services can always lock up your deposited money like Celsius Network infamously did in June 2022.\n\n\n  If you have only a small amount of crypto, you can stake it using staking pools. You will be charged a fee but a large pool has better chance to be selected by the network than a small holder. In a lot of pools, the minimum staked amount is only symbolic, such as 1 unit of the staking coin.\n  Once you earn more crypto, the best way to stake crypto will be directly from your own wallet. Most popular staking wallets that cost nothing to purchase are Exodus wallet (most big cryptos), Trust wallet (Binance), Phantom wallet (Solana ecosystem)\n\n\nThese were just a few ideas to get you started on earning crypto without investing any money. With a little effort, you can start earning crypto and building up your portfolio, and all that without risking any money on trading.\n",

      title: "6 Basic Financial Tools Everybody Should Know",
      content: "Money is essential in all peoples' lives and every day, most folks are involved in some form of financial activity. This could range from buying groceries to learning where to buy Rune crypto.\n\nIt's important to handle your money well so that it grows over time and that you stay out of debt.\n\nThere are a lot of financial tools available to help you - and in this article, we'll discuss 6 basic ones that everybody should know.\n\n\n  \n    Credit Score Trackers\n\n    A credit score is a numerical expression based on a statistical analysis of a person's credit files, to represent their creditworthiness. It's one of the factors that lenders use to determine whether to give you a loan and what interest rate they'll charge you. It will also be referred to if you attempt to extend your credit.\n\n    A credit score tracker can help you monitor it so you can see how it changes over time. It'll work in the background to analyze it and report any changes. There are many different versions available, but some of the more popular ones include Credit Karma, Mint and NerdWallet. Many people learn more about the various software options by making a Google search. It's helpful that Credit Sesame explained in this review that it's possible to get a free credit score, credit report and identity protection. People can also receive mobile protection, cashback offers and savings recommendations.\n  \n  \n    Budget Planners\n\n    A budget planner is a tool that helps you monitor your income and expenses. It can be used to create a budget, check your spending, and find ways to save money. They can protect you from overspending each month, and getting into debt. They can also keep track of your progress towards specific financial goals (e.g. saving up for a vacation or a down payment on a house).\n\n    By taking the time to review your income and expenses, you can gain insights into your spending habits. This information can be used to amend your lifestyle, leading to more financial stability and peace of mind.\n  \n  \n    Debt Calculators\n\n    This is a tool that can help you calculate your monthly payments and interest rates for different types of debts. There are many versions available online, and most of them are free to use. To find one that'll work best for you, try looking for a \"debt calculator\" on a search engine such as Google or Bing, and reading the reviews.\n\n    You can use a debt calculator to consolidate your debts into one single monthly payment. This may be able to significantly reduce your debt repayment sum, and you'd also save money on interest charges (potentially hundreds or even thousands of dollars). Another advantage of using a debt calculator is that it can help you create a debt payoff plan. This can be especially helpful if you have a lot of debt and aren't sure where to start. (It's also worth talking to a financial advisor or credit counselor who can help you develop a budget and create a plan to get out of debt).\n  \n  \n    Retirement Planners\n\n    They're tools that can be used to estimate how much money you'll need to have saved in order to retire comfortably. They can also be used to create a retirement savings plan and track your progress. There are many different types of planners available - so do your research and find one that best suits your needs. Some popular tools include:\n\n    \n      Financial calculators: They can be used to estimate how much you'll need to save based on your current age, income and other factors.\n      Retirement planning software: This can help you create a personalized retirement plan and regularly monitor your progress.\n      Investment tools: There are many different ones available that can help you plan for retirement and make sure your money is working for you.\n    \n\n    The benefits of using a retirement planner include:\n\n    \n      Helping you estimate how much money you'll need to save up.\n      Creating a personalized retirement plan that takes into account your unique circumstances.\n      Reviewing your progress over time and making adjustments as needed.\n    \n  \n  \n    Insurance Policies\n\n    With these different contracts, you agree to pay the insurance company a premium in exchange for the promise of financial protection in the event of an unexpected loss, accident or event. Some examples of insurance policies include health, auto, homeowners, life and disability. They can help cover the cost of unexpected medical bills, repairs to your home or car, or replacement income if you become disabled and unable to work.\n\n    Insurance policies can provide peace of mind that you and your loved ones are financially protected in case of an emergency. Second, they can help you manage risk by transferring the financial burden of an unexpected loss to the insurance company. It's wise talking to a licensed insurance agent or broker to get more information and compare rates from different companies. Read the fine print before signing any contracts, as not every eventuality may be covered.\n  \n  \n    Mortgage Calculators\n\n    These are online tools that allow users to input their financial information in order to estimate their monthly mortgage payments. Benefits of using a mortgage calculator include being able to:\n\n    \n      compare different loan scenarios side-by-side\n      estimate your monthly payment based on different interest rates\n      get a general understanding of the total cost of your loan\n    \n\n    While mortgage calculators can be helpful in giving you an idea of what you can expect to pay each month, it's important to remember that they're only estimates. Your actual payment may be higher or lower depending on factors like taxes, insurance, and other related fees. For the most accurate picture of what you'll pay each month, speak with a loan officer or mortgage broker.\n  \n\n\nThese 6 major tools can help you manage your finances well, both now and in the future. In return for a little time and research, you'll be able to find the ones that are most suitable for you. You'll soon reap the benefits and will be able to achieve your financial goals in the short and long term.\n",

      title: "Charting the Armageddon: What tools were crypto traders using during the last round of sell-offs",
      content: "The crypto markets are going through a wave of relentless sell-offs that were propelled by the FED rate hike as well as forced selling as the Bitfinex whale fund 3AC and some other large players had to liquidate some of their losing positions.\n\nThe price action eventually took a relief bounce from the low of below 18000 USD for Bitcoin and cryptotwitter has launched several speculations as to who bought the dip.\n\nBinance was the first rumored buyer, by now SBF (the co-founder of FTX exchange) leads the gossip stats.\n\n\n\nSince the rumour has it the dip was bought by a single entity, or just a very small number of entities, it ended up adding to the fears that the pause from the market collapse will not last. If there is not enough other buyers to make the rally catch on, a single whale will not be able to carry the market on their shoulders.\n\nSo, just in case there’s something true to the that, here’s a list of tools that might well be useful again.\n\n7 tools to watch when crypto markets tumble\n\nBecause a lot of the selling was forced and not speculative, technical analysis didn’t have much power there. One sign of that - and probably the one sign that everyone noticed - was that the market would bleed and bleed without bouncing. Impossible to chart anything unless you have good imagination.\n\nStill, traders did end up following the charts. There’s not really much else you can do.\n\nHere’s a list of 7 tools that crypto traders watched as the prices of everything tumbled. They are both technical and fundamental tools, and let’s start with the fundamental ones.\n\n\n  \n    FED rate hike anticipation via CME\n\n    The first tool that crypto traders watched was the FED rate hike anticipation via the CME. This was because the FED rate hike would have a direct impact on the prices of cryptocurrencies - and of the prices of every asset that is perceived as risky.\n\n    All the basics are explained in this reference.\n\n    For the probabilities the market is pricing in, use the CME’s FedWatch tool.\n\n    \n  \n  \n    Bitcoin dominance metrics\n\n    Bitcoin dominance, or BTC.D on Tradingview charts, is a technical tool that crypto traders watched as the prices of everything tumbled. This metric measures how much of the total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies is represented by Bitcoin.\n\n    The reason why this matters is that typically, as proven by history, all crypto markets will trend down together if the decline is serious. But if the markets start to turn, traders want to see Bitcoin rising while the rest of the market is lagging, it might be a sign that the market is about to turn around.\n\n    Even without speculating on where the bottom might be, BTC.D can provide a lot of information about the markets. Here’s BTC.D chart with or without stablecoins that was shared on the BitcoinMarkets forum:\n\n    \n\n    Get a FREE Tradingview account\n  \n  \n    News about liquidations on DeFi blockchains\n\n    DeFi farms were a major feature of this past bull season.  It was a completely new phenomenon, and it caught everyone’s attention.\n\n    The two technically strongest market leaders were Solana and Luna, consistently throughout the bull season. Those are the limitations of getting your intel from charts: Sometimes the price reflects a collective illusion, just like it happened before the mortgage crisis in TradFi.\n\n    When crypto started to crash, traders naturally looked at especially at lending platforms to see how they will do when everyone’s loans will start to get liquidated.\n\n    This kind of news would appear on Twitter and Medium accounts of those DeFi platforms first, but the huge subreddit r/Cryptocurrency would get the news soon enough.\n\n    \n  \n  \n    Weekly SMA of 200 and 300\n\n    Long weekly standard moving averages were the last lines of support where some traders expected the price action to reverse.\n\n    Many bitcoin traders cited the Covid crash in early 2020 as an example - the market tumbled in the general panic but bounced on high volume back over the 200 SMA. Speculators were buying the dip at the 200 SMA in June 2022.\n\n    \n  \n  \n    Weekly WMAs\n\n    The WMA is weighted moving average. A lagging indicator, but lagging less than standard moving average. Crypto traders use it to identify trends. The WMA of 200 and 300 were two technical tools that crypto traders watched as the prices of everything tumbled.\n\n    The WMA of 200 or 300 are used to identify long-term trends, which is why they are key tools in times when every asset enters the bear market territory.\n\n    \n  \n  \n    Fibonacci lines\n\n    Fibonacci is the charting tool that will paint a line for you even in places where there’s just empty space. That is what makes the Fib the favourite technical analysis tool of crypto traders who want to chart possible pit-stop levels of crypto that is rallying past its all-time-high. In the same way, traders charted with Fibs to see where the markets might potentially get a bounce.\n\n    It did not work very well because a good chunk of the selling for forced and Fibs are based in technical analysis (and frankly, esoteric beliefs). On the other hand they do give a vague idea of levels on which traders on the sidelines might be willing to enter the market and they might work as a sort of coordinating tool.\n  \n  \n    The RSI family for momentum\n\n    The RSI is a momentum indicator that is more complex than ROC and therefore provides information about whether the market is “oversold”.\n\n    The RSI is a popular indicator in crypto trading communities especially now because it has been oversold for a long time. Traders jump to the conclusion that a reversal must be near.\n\n    Well, RSI doesn’t guarantee that the market cannot stay oversold. There’s actual money needed to bring the asset out of the oversold territory. If that money isn’t available, RSI might just keep being oversold.\n  \n\n\nFinal words\n\nWhether you trade on technical or fundamental analysis, it is important to understand that no market moves in a straight line. There are always corrections along the way. Do not let emotions get the best of you and enjoy the show!\n",

      title: "Security Concerns of DeFi & Crypto: Steps you can take to minimize your risks",
      content: "When crypto first became somewhat known in 2012, it was touted as being hack-proof, making it the safest form of digital currency transfer available. From today’s point of view, that looks reminiscent of the good old days when everyone believed that Mac OS is immune to computer viruses.\n\nToday, crypto is seen as an effective tool for ensuring data integrity but it's not completely secure. If you're using blockchain for online money transfers to suppliers, vendors, mobile casino sites, or for any other reason, you need to be aware that there are risks and how you should mitigate those dangers.\n\nBlockchain Security: Every new application brings vulnerabilities\n\nDistributed ledger technology, also known as the blockchain, along with the cryptocurrencies that are powered by this blockchain technology, have experienced successes and failures since they were first introduced but blockchain's biggest success is that it has become an essential method of transferring funds throughout the world.\n\nApplications of blockchain are constantly expanding - look at stablecoins, DeFi, NFT platforms.\n\nBut new applications bring vulnerabilities to breaches in security – perhaps not the same kinds as TradFi online banking methods but still, open to compromise.\n\nDecentralisation is not a panacea\n\nIn the early years of blockchain, it was seen as an ideal technology for cybersecurity because it is decentralized. There are a wide range of applications in distributed ledger technology in areas such as permissioned sharing of financial data, encrypted messaging platforms, medical data sharing and monitoring of credit scores or money laundering.\n\nToday we know that, while blockchain may be a better choice security-wise than conventional money transferring platforms, there are still issues to be resolved.\n\n\n  There are platform-based types of vulnerabilities such as coding errors that give hackers an entry point into the ledger.\n  The complexity of some DeFi applications leads to user mistakes that can make them vulnerable to breaches.\n\n\nThe security of blockchain technologies, services and applications is dependent on their inherent weaknesses and while no blockchain-based large-scale hack has yet occurred, there have been small-scale hacks and it's not impossible that a larger one could occur.\n\nIn short, blockchain keeps evolving but so does the cybercrime. Hackers can look forward to more powerful tools and more sophisticated algorithms that are beginning to dominate the market that gives hackers new ways to compromise the security of the blockchain.\n\nSecurity Issues from the User’s Point of View\n\nAs a DeFi user, active trader or crypto investor, here are the most important issues that you should watch out for:\n\n\n  \n    Attack on the platform\n\n    Decentralized platforms come with all sorts of system designs, some rather poor. It is a good practice to have a security audit to any application based on smart contracts, but that does not make a DeFi platform immune to all vulnerabilities.\n\n    Custodial “DeFi” platforms, such as lending networks where you need to deposit liquidity into an exchange account, are on par with custodial exchanges. They can prevent you from accessing your money at any time, just like Celsius Network did in June 2022.\n\n    \n\n    Last but not least, you might lose money even if you are not engaging in DeFi staking protocols due to the devaluation of the underlying cryptocurrency - as it happened with Luna.\n\n    The bottom line is that when a DeFi platform gets under attack, the people who used its services and held its tokens may lose their money. At the same time, as a user you cannot control the security practices deployed by the platform.\n\n    Your only security protection here is to mitigate the potential damages: DeFi is experimental, do not put in more money than you can afford to lose.\n  \n  \n    Phishing\n\n    Phishing attempts involve scammers who send email messages with fraudulent links, most commonly related to a crypto wallet update.\n\n    The email appears to be from a legitimate source but if the user clicks on the link, it gives the scammer access to information in the user's computer that provides the user's blockchain wallet keys and entry into the blockchain.\n\n    The most widely known example of phishing is the Ledger wallet phishing campaign that has been ongoing since Ledger’s customer database got breached in second half of 2020.\n\n    Most crypto wallets these days will let you run any software updates from the wallet’s app. Your best precaution is to always do that and just plain never click any update link in emails.\n  \n  \n    Cryptojacking\n\n    Cryptojacking is an illicit takeover of computational resources to mine cryptocurrencies or perform other crypto-related tasks. Crypto-malware is malicious software that is installed on a user's device.\n\n    Once the device is installed they will use the victim's computing power to mine cryptocurrencies secretly. Modern cryptojacking scripts are designed to pause when the victim’s phone wakes up and is being actively used, which means the victim will never notice anything.\n\n    The software can be disguised in an email attachment that executes as soon as the user clicks on the attachment or link, so your best protection is to not click on unexpected attachments.\n\n    Fun fact, crypto malware it can also be deployed to the computer in other ways too. So, for instance if you use your employers’ infrastructure to secretly mine crypto at work, you may be guilty of cryptojacking.\n  \n  \n    51% Attacks\n\n    Proof of Work blockchains involve \"mining\" for new coins, typically using extremely powerful, application-specific computers.\n\n    This is particularly true for large-scale public blockchains like Bitcoin and has caused much concern in the early days of it. (Some newer altcoins like Monero or Chia coin have made adjustments to remove the advantage of application-specific devices.)\n\n    When a group of miners gathers enough resources, they can seize more than 50% of the mining power of the network and then control the ledger and, if they wish, modify it. The 51% attack can't work on a private blockchain but it can work on a public blockchain.\n\n    There is nothing you can do to prevent this. Mitigating your risks is the only advice to give here.\n  \n  \n    Sybil Attack\n\n    \"Sybil\" refers to the title character in the book \"Sybil\" who was afflicted with a multiple personality disorder.\n\n    In blockchain jargon, Sybil attack occurs when the hacker creates and uses a number of fraudulent network identities to subvert the service's reputation system.\n\n    Bots and malicious entities simulate fake GPS reports which influences social navigation systems and clogs up the network. If the attack is successful it can bring the system down.\n\n    Again, nothing you can do to prevent it. It is safe to say that smaller blockchains are more vulnerable to this attack than large, public networks like Bitcoin.\n  \n\n\nChecklist: Precautions to Take\n\nThere are nearly 600 custodial cryptocurrency exchanges worldwide and they have varying levels of security protocols.\n\nAscendEX was hacked in December 2021 after a compromised crypto hot wallet was breached. About USD$80 million worth of cryptocurrencies was stolen, emphasizing the fact that just because an exchange is a blockchain, it doesn't mean that it's automatically immune from hacking.\n\nWhen you choose a crypto exchange and as you work with it, security should be your primary consideration. Of course a lot of it depends on the exchange, but if you're using blockchain you still want to do as much as possible to protect yourself:\n\n\n  Do your research so that you are interacting with a trading platform that utilizes advanced security features. The platform should give you the option of downloading a full report of the activities of your account quickly and easily based on any period of time.\n  Don't click on any links in any emails that you don't recognize, regardless of how official it looks. Never provide any information to these emails or links, especially anything that would give them information that they would need to access your crypto wallet's private keys.\n  Instal anti-crypto mining ad-blockers and extensions on your computers. Disable JavaScript to safeguard your computer from cryptojacking. Install antivirus software to protect you from malware attacks.\n  Don't download applications that your trading platform doesn't control.\n  Use a VPN to protect your personal information and mask your location.\n  Use multi-factor authentication to provide additional security.\n\n",

      title: "On Overcoming the Fears of Newbie Traders",
      content: "Getting into a trade can be a scary experience. Trading, and crypto trading particularly, requires you to make fast but calculated decisions every time. You have to know your craft well to manage all the responsibility that falls on you.\n\nAfter all, you are dealing with real money here. Often, they come at large sums, and it’s up to you whether to double or burn all those investments.\n\nThat’s why many new traders feel so much stress and fear when at work. However, these two feelings can become trader’s biggest enemies.\n\nTrading is all about confidence, decision-making, and experience. You can’t achieve those when you’re too busy dealing with anxiety. Hence, you have to learn how to overcome your fear before actually putting on the work.\n\nSo, here are some tips on how to overcome your biggest fears when you are a newbie trader.\n\nUnderstand fear\n\nFirst and foremost, you should think of what makes you so fearful of the market.\n\nWhat is it that makes you doubt yourself and second-guess your every decision? Is it simply the lack of experience? Are you too afraid to risk any money? Is it greed speaking, and you can’t let go?\n\nPerhaps, you just fear missing the potential gain. You have to ponder the reasons that make you drag behind at work. As annoying as it is, you first need to recognize and identify your fears before you can work on resolving them.\n\nOnce you know what you are dealing with, you can fight it. Remember, fear is just an automatic way your mind responds when stressed or threatened. That means the fear will stay exactly until you learn to feel comfortable with the stresses that come with trading.\n\nOne way to move past these emotions is by quantifying them. Get ready to see the price action you fear to see and prepare your response. Be ready for the things you are afraid of. This way, you will know what comes next even when things don’t go your way.\n\nEducate yourself\n\nOf course, the more comfortable you are when trading, the more at ease you feel. Making potentially life-changing decisions every day is a tough job to handle. However, once you learn all about it, you will get accustomed to such a responsibility.\n\nHence, education and experience are the two best methods to overcome fear in trading. One can’t be without the other. You need to constantly learn new things about trade, markets, and even yourself. This way, you are not going to be caught completely unprepared when something unpredictable happens. You will have the acquired skill to decide despite the stress, and to back up your decisions.\n\nExperience, though, is harder to get. It takes time. However, the more vigorously you work, the more experience you get.\n\nSo, it’s kind of the catch-22 here. You are too afraid to make decisions, yet you need to work to gain experience. The best you can do here is let the reason take over your emotions. You know you can do it. Weigh in all your decisions with the skills and knowledge you already have.\n\nLearn more if you need to. Perhaps even go to the basics and ask academic writing services for help. For example, you can read these write paper for me reviews to see what type of help they can give you on your matter.\n\nSet up rules\n\nRules, trading plans and even time schedules may help you put order into your work.\n\nUsing rules, you set certain limitations to what you can and can’t do. There should be no fear present while you work within those limitations.\n\nTime schedules set you up for working in a focused way and if you keep them, will prevent analysis paralysis. Set some time every morning for your charting and analysis and don’t come back to it during the day.\n\nTrading rules should include your rules for risk budgeting and risk management decisions. You need to have decided for yourself when enough is enough, meaning when you cut the losses. Also, you can calculate your risk-rewards situation to know what risks are worth taking. Here, you will operate on your own rules and not fear that stops you.\n\nAdditionally, you can set off extra triggers that can impact your decisions. Thus, you will know what events can provoke you to sell or buy stock by the rules you already have.\n\nOf course, having specific limits on money losses will help you manage your fears. This way, you know when to stop or continue as you have already planned your limitations.\n\nRecap\n\nContrary to popular belief, trading is nothing to be feared. You just need to grow confident in your abilities and skills so that you are not afraid to trade. Easier said than done, because sadly there’s no shortcut with 5 easy tips that will get you there overnight.\n\nSo, most of the confidence comes with experience. Yet, you can speed up the adjusting period by following the steps above. So, don’t be afraid to look directly at your fears. You have to address them to fight them, right?\n\nWhile trading, you shouldn’t let anything interfere with what you do, and that includes emotions. Bad trades happen when you let yourself be controlled by emotions.\n\nAll in all, you’ll be better off with a set of rules and a trading plan They will define your limitations and goals in trading. That in turn will limit risks and take the fears with them.\n\nLastly, you should always make decisions based on your area of expertise. Hence, you need to build a strong foundation of awareness and experience in the area that you’re trading.\n\nBy way of TLDR; you will always play it safe by using the rational part of your mind instead of the emotions. At the same time, remember that markets are never one hundred percent predictable and your capital is always at risk.\n",

      title: "How To Choose Your Online Broker Based On Your Trading Style",
      content: "When you’ve decided to take up online trading and the time comes to choose an online broker, it can be difficult to know where to start whether it’s crypto, forex or any other type of market. There are so many different platforms available, each with its own set of features and benefits.\n\nHow do you know which one is right for you? This blog post will provide some tips on how to choose the ideal online broker for your needs.\n\nConsider the type of trader you are\n\nOne of the first things you should consider when choosing an online broker is what type of trader you are.\n\n\n  Are you a day trader?\n  Are you a swing trader?\n  A long-term investor?\n\n\nEach type of trader has different needs, and not all trading platforms will be a good fit for every type of trader.\n\nIf you are a day trader or a scalper, you will need a broker that offers low fees. In short-term trading you are taking smaller profits and a hefty fee will eat into that.\n\nOn the other hand, if you are a long-term investor, you are probably most concerned with tools for strategies like dollar cost averaging. Good, long-term holder focused platforms let you automate your dollar cost average easily.\n\nSimilarly, you also need to think about the types of assets you are interested in. For example, if you are only interested in forex trading, you will need to find a good broker that offers forex trading. When it comes to online forex brokers, you have to remember that not all of them are created equal. It is important to do your research.\n\nOn the other hand, if you are interested in trading both crypto and forex, there are platforms that combine both.\n\nLikewise, if it’s stocks that interest you but you are also a crypto trader, some crypto trading platforms now make tokenized stocks available.\n\nThink about your trading style\n\nAnother thing to consider when choosing an online trading platform is your trading style.\n\n\n  Do you trade every day or do you prefer to make a few trades a year?\n  Do you trade large or small volumes?\n\n\nDepending on your trading style, some platforms may be a better fit than others. For example, if you trade frequently but with low volumes, you will need an exchange that has commission discounts coming from something other than traded volume. In the crypto trading industry, exchanges will typically offer fee rebates for holders of their exchange token.\n\nIf you don't trade often, the commission might not be as big of a concern for you. You might just prefer a time-tested, reliable broker - whatever the fee. It all depends on your individual needs and preferences.\n\nYou also need to think about the types of orders you will be placing. Some brokers don’t offer advanced types of orders like the trailing stop, one-cancels-other or even a limit stop.\n\nSome scalping strategies need you to place a lot of trailing stop orders, for instance, so to trade in that style you will want to find a broker that offers this type of order. Conversely, if you don't place many stop limit orders, this may not be as important to you.\n\nFrom there, you also need to consider the platform. Some brokers offer platforms that are easy to use but don’t have many functions. Others offer a lot of advanced functions but in consequence, the trading interface ends up optimised only for the power user. That kind of platform can be confusing for many. Some platforms offer a switch in their trading app where you can choose between a simple and an advanced interface.\n\nLook into the fees involved\n\nAs mentioned above, an important consideration when choosing an online broker is the fees involved. Make sure to compare the commissions and other fees charged by different brokers. Some brokers charge higher commissions than others, so this is something you might want to take into account if you trade often.\n\nYou should also look at the fees charged for different types of orders.\n\nFor example, the brokerage fees are usually higher for market orders than for limit orders. Some brokers charge the same fee for both, which might suit you better. Again, it all depends on your individual needs and preferences.\n\nFactor in your investment goals\n\nWhen choosing an online broker, you also need to consider your investment goals.\n\nWhat are you looking to achieve with your investments? Are you looking to grow your portfolio or generate income?\n\nDepending on your investment goals, some brokers may be a better fit than others. For example, if you are looking to grow your portfolio, you will want to find a platform that offers a wide range of spot markets. As an investor, you will want to buy the asset on a spot market and hold it.\n\nOn the other hand, if you are looking to generate income, you may be more interested in finding a platform that offers perpetual swaps with low brokerage fee or similar affordable speculative products.\n\nFinal words\n\nUltimately, there is no \"perfect\" online broker. The one for you will depend on your individual needs and preferences. By considering the factors above, you should be able to narrow down your options and find the best platforms for your needs.\n\nThere are plenty out there though, so whether it’s forex, crypto or stocks, rest assured that with a little bit of research you will be able to find the ideal online broker for your needs.\n",

      title: "Wyckoff Market Cycles: Cheatsheet, Schematics and Guide (Long term, Short term)",
      content: "The Wyckoff Method is a time-tested approach to trading the markets, especially on longer time frames.\n\nIn the crypto community, the Wyckoff method is seen as controversial because of the prevalence of chart patterns like Bart and generally the high volatility that comes with new markets for experimental assets.\n\nSome swing traders on the large cap crypto markets do use Wyckoff method, though, and you will find the occasional Wyckoff report in communities frequented by Bitcoin traders in particular - not so much in low-cap crypto communities.\n\nIn this article:\n\n  Wyckoff theory 101\n  Basic Wyckoff cycles schema\n    \n      Wyckoff Accumulation Schematic\n      Wyckoff Distribution Schematic\n    \n  \n  Full Wyckoff market cycle cheatsheet including four reaccumulation patterns\n  Using Wyckoff on shorter timeframes\n\n\nWyckoff Theory of Cause and Effect\n\nThe Wyckoff theory is based on the idea that supply and demand can be determined by studying price action, volume and time. This information can then be used to anticipate future market movements by speculating on which pattern is most likely about to form, because the changes in supply and demand are the cause of the changes in price, which is the effect.\n\nThe fact that Wyckoff theory makes judgements out of patterns absolutely makes Wyckoff method a technical analysis and therefore fairly esoteric.\n\nIn place of a standard risk disclaimer, it should be noted that any technical analysis is off the table the moment somebody enters the market with a large amount of money and a determination to turn the tables. That’s why stop loss orders and risk management exist.\n\nAnalysing Wyckoff Cycles in the Market\n\nThe Wyckoff theory has its own method of five steps to evaluate when analysing markets, but only the first of them is related to market cycles. The other four judge the whole industry with respect to which niche and asset to choose to trade and which to avoid.\n\nThe one cycle-related step for analysing markets according to Wyckoff is to simply look at whether the market is trending or not.\n\nStands to reason - you can’t trade without knowing the market’s direction.\n\nIt’s also fairly easy to detect:\n\n  Has the price changed consistently in a single direction over the past few candles on your timeframe? That’s a trending market on that timeframe.\n  If the price didn’t go anywhere on your timeframe, that’s a sideways or ranging market.\n\n\nThe Wyckoff cycle schematics\n\nThe crudest way to look at market cycles with Wyckoff theory then is to acknowledge that markets go periodically through periods where they are trending and through periods where they are ranging.\n\n\n\nWyckoff Accumulation Schematic\n\nOne of the ranging parts of the cycle is the accumulation range. Accumulation is the range that forms at the bottom of a downtrend and is characterised by increasing volume in buying.\n\nThe price is overall suppressed and majority of market participants are skeptical, which shows in the sell-offs from the top of the range.\n\nThe sign of strength is that these sell-offs from resistance are weaker with time. Typically they end in the final selloff which dips below support, but is decisively bought up. That is the Wyckoff spring.\n\nThe accumulation range ends when the resistance at the top of the range is broken on volume, with a throwback which turns it into a support.\n\n\n\nWyckoff Distribution Schematic\n\nDistribution is the part of the market cycle where the market slowly tops out, most typically in three pushes.\n\nThe reason Wyckoff theory gives for this pattern effect is that entities that bought during accumulation, when the majority of the market was skeptical, are now selling to people who are buying convinced by the market’s strength.\n\nThe distribution phase is characterised by weakening rallies to the top of the range that get sold off and ultimately fail to get bought up at the bottom of the range. The counterpart to Wyckoff spring is here the Wyckoff Up-Thrust, a failed low-volume rally.\n\nThe distribution range ends when the market breaks its support completely with a throwback which turns it into a resistance - that’s a sing of weakness.\n\n\n\nThe full Wyckoff market cycle cheatsheet (Accumulation, Distribution, Reaccumulation)\n\nThe last major point to analysing market cycles with Wyckoff theory are pause-ranges.\n\nThe accumulation and distribution ranges create a cause for the emergence of the trend:\n\n  At the end of accumulation, a critical amount of traders choose to no longer sell at the top of the range, which forces the prices up.\n  At the end of distribution, a critical amount of traders choose to no longer buy at the bottom of the range, which forces the prices down.\n\n\nBut because the markets are not completely coordinated, we very often get pause-ranges within the trending phase. The most common pause-range is the reaccumulation, which is a range that resembles distribution but ultimately resolves into a continuation of the mark-up phase.\n\nThere are several common patterns for reaccumulations explained in the Wyckoff cheatsheet below, and one rare type of reaccumulation pattern. There’s some long-shot hopium in there, if you look for it.\n\n\n\nWyckoff cycles on shorter and longer timeframes\n\nNotice that the same market can be trending on 30M but ranging on 1D. The Wyckoff theory is just a tool, there’s a degree of freedom in how to apply it, but in crypto specifically you will get more reliable results when looking at timeframes over 4H. Wyckoff theory is not built well for trading the daily volatility - the overshooting and undershooting - and on most of crypto markets, there’s a lot of that on shorter timeframes. Forex traders on the other hand do use Wyckoff theory for 30M or 1H.\n\nAs for scalping or grid trading crypto, there are tools and strategies that are a far better fit for that.\n\nThe best way you would reasonably use Wyckoff method for scalping would be to look at the overall trend of the market, comparing it with the industry, to see if there’s the potential that the market you chose will keep its sideways action.\n\nWyckoff theory does single out markets that are poised for a large move - and Wyckoff would advise traders to trade those. But if you are a scalper, you can use Wyckoff theory to the opposite end: Scalp or grid trade or shadow trade the markets that are not poised for a big move.\n\nAs you see, Wyckoff Market Cycle is a powerful tool that can help you answer the question of what crypto to trade, even if you are a scalper.\n\nFinal words\n\nIf you put in the time, any charting skill will give you some advantage in terms of timing your trades and maximizing your profits.\n\nBy using the Wyckoff Method, you do get an edge over other traders who are guessing about the market’s next move without looking at the bigger picture, the industry, the economy. It can provide a way to see through other traders’ interests and it can show you how they’re preparing for future moves. You would need to spend a lot of time analysing the markets and also trading, though. Practical skills can’t be read up.\n",

      title: "Staking Shiba Inu: Best platforms, how much can you earn, is it worth it?",
      content: "Interested in earning rewards for supporting a blockchain? No wonder. Cold staking, or sometimes called network staking, is the least risky way to earn extra income on cryptocurrency that you are holding anyway.\n\nShiba Inu is one of the meme dog coins that hasn’t lost on popularity among crypto traders. Being an Ethereum token, cold staking was not available for Shiba Inu for a long time.\n\nThat’s now changed. Ethereum’s blockchain still uses the proof-of-work protocol, but as the network upgrades slowly advance, network staking is becoming available. That’s how staking Shiba Inu opened, allowing you to earn rewards just by committing your tokens to the network.The SHIB for cold staking is available through ETH’s beacon nodes.\n\nThis, among several other factors, creates a bottleneck which means that SHIB staking is not yet widely implemented - not on crypto exchanges, not in crypto wallets, not in staking platforms. That, in turn, can make for higher staking yields.\n\nStaking rewards also depend on how much is the blockchain used though, and there is always a lull during bear markets as well as during summers. Still, the current yields for cold staking of SHIB look pretty good.\n\nStaking Shiba Inu on Binance\n\nAt the moment, the only mainstream custodial platform that offers staking of Shiba Inu coins is Binance.com.\n\nAs of June 2022, Binance offers locked cold staking of Shiba Inu coin at between 10% and 12% APY with locks between 10 and 60 days.\n\nThe minimum locked amount is only 200 SHIB, which is next to nothing in dollars. Only a few weeks ago, Binance required millions of Shiba Inu coins as the minimal commitment, or the equivalent of about 10 USD.\n\n\n\nStaking Shiba Inu: Rate retrieved June 2022. Staking rewards fluctuate, check current rate at Binance\n\nYou can use the Binance.com easy-to-use web interface or mobile app to stake your Shiba Inu tokens as far as the capacity allows as Binance.com limits their cold staking pools to make sure the yield doesn’t get too diluted.\n\n\n  To access SHIB staking on Binance, click this link which takes you directly to the list of locked staking coins. Then type SHIB into the search bar on the left.\n\n\nStaking Shiba Inu on ShibaSwap\n\nShibaSwap is a DEX that lets you earn income on your Shiba Inu tokens either by providing them as liquidity, farming or cold staking.\n\nShibaSwap uses its own lingo for these features:\n\n\n  DIG = Liquidity provision, also called DeFi staking. LPs earn returns on trades within a pool that are proportional to their share. Yields are paid in real time and can be claimed by withdrawing your liquidity, but ShibaSwap locks a portion of them for 6 months.\n  WOOF = Claiming of your LP returns via additional farming. You must deposit the ShibaSwap Liquidity Provider Tokens that you earned through cold or DeFi staking into a pair pool. During the time that SSLP token is deposited, additional returns are accrued in real time. You can take out  33% of your LP returns instantly, but the remaining 67% of them will be time-locked for 6 months.\n  BURY = Cold staking. You can lock up your SHIB for an APY that is far more volatile than at Binance according to ShibaSwap’s analytics, but currently at mere 0.22% APY for SHIB tokens. Withdrawal is subject to the same 6 months lock as liquidity provision profits.\n\n\nThe biggies - Staking Shiba Inu via Ledger, Exodus, AllNodes\n\nThe US-based staking platform AllNodes does not run SHIB staking, but it might do soon as ETH Beacon nodes are listed as one of their soon-to-launch features.\n\nFor now on AllNodes, as far as Ethereum ecosystem goes, you can stake the OG ETH coin only, and that in minipools of 16 ETH each. The minipools at AllNodes launched only a few weeks back and there are already hundreds of them, so the launch of Beacon nodes is probably an event to stay tuned for.\n\nExodus wallet does not support staking of ETH tokens directly, neither does Ledger, but you can use both to stake on ShibaSwap or on AllNodes.\n\nIs it worth it to stake Shiba Inu?\n\nShiba Inu has the total supply capped at one quadrillion tokens. This limits any reasonable possibility to create scarcity for Shiba Inu coins any time soon. Scarcity is, in theory, what drives the price of assets up.\n\nOn the other hand, SHIB is a volatile cryptocurrency that offers so many avenues to capitalize on its price swings.\n\nFurthermore, as you will notice at ShibaSwap, there are two other core tokens critical to the governance of Shiba Inu coin - BONE and LEASH - which have much smaller total cap. In line with that, their ATH values have reached the highs of over 3 USD for BONE and over 4000 USD for LEASH.\n\nIf you believe in the power of the meme, it may be worth it to stake SHIB, just purely to stay up to date with its governance systems and its valuations.\n\nIt is worth pointing out that some cryptocurrency analysts will want to take SHIB as the lab or testnet project for Ethereum blockchain, similar to the way Litecoin has been considered in relation to Bitcoin.\n\nFinal words\n\nAs a result, we may see some interesting developments for Shiba Inu in the future that could make it a more valuable cryptocurrency.\n\nAll in all, staking Shiba Inu is a new way to make some extra income from your tokens without having to do much other than holding them in your wallet and keeping your private keys safe. If you’re looking for a place to do some staking, ShibaSwap is a good option, but Binance.com is clearly the easier one to use.\n\nFor those of you who are large stakers and don’t care about exchanges cutting up to 25% off your staking rewards on their fee, don’t miss the start of ETH token staking on AllNodes.\n",

      title: "6 Steps To Help You Choose A Trading Platform",
      content: "It is important to have a crypto platform that makes your trading easier, whether you day trade or DCA.\n\nWith so many different options available, choosing the right one can be a long process, especially if you’re not quite sure what to look for.\n\nBy following these six steps, you can narrow down your options, find a crypto trading platform that is right for you and then test-ride it just to make sure.\n\n\n  \n    Choose a platform that suits your level of experience\n\n    It is important to choose a platform that suits your experience. There are a variety of different platforms available, so it is important to do some research to find one that best suits your requirements.\n\n    Moreover, according to this article, there are two types of online trading platforms: proprietary trading platforms and commercial trading platforms. Understanding both of these platforms will help you narrow down your options and make informed decisions that take your particular needs into account.\n\n    A proprietary trading platform is a trading platform created by a financial institution to trade securities within that institution. These platforms are designed for professional traders and offer direct access to market data and analysis tools.\n\n    Some of the typical features of these platforms include real-time quotes, advanced charting capabilities, and order management tools. In the crypto industry, FTX and Bitfinex come closest to this definition. And just as the legacy proprietary trading platforms, they are not designed for intuitive use.\n\n    A commercial trading platform is another type of online platform that allows businesses to list their products or services for sale, and connect with buyers from all over the world. It's a powerful tool in the world of business, but it does have an equivalent in the crypto industry: P2P marketplaces like LocalCryptos or LocalMonero.\n\n    If you're a beginner, it might be better to start at a platform that is easy to use and navigate. Once you become more at home with that you might want to switch to a platform that offers advanced charting and analysis tools.\n  \n  \n    Consider your trading style and preferences\n\n    When you're thinking about which trading platform to use, it's important to consider your own trading style.\n\n    \n      Are you a day trader or a scalper who likes to make lots of small, quick trades?\n      Are flexible and open to trading in altcoins, or just the big cryptocurrencies?\n      Are you a longer-term investor who prefers to make fewer, bigger trades, or do you trade the grid and want to automate it?\n    \n\n    The best trading platforms will offer features that cater to your particular style of trading.\n\n    For example, platforms like FTX and Bitfinex offer more charting and analysis tools for technical traders. They will also typically have lower fees to cater to the short term traders - FTX here is a case in point with the lowest fees all around.\n\n    On the other hand, platforms like Binance, Phemex and Bitforex provide more research resources and new altcoin markets for those who like to trade low-cap crypto.\n\n    Before you start looking at different trading platforms, it's helpful to take a step back and think about what are the specifics you require from a platform.\n\n    Make a list of the features that are most important to you. For example, do you need:\n\n    \n      Wide variety of markets?\n      Advanced charting and analysis tools?\n      Hosted staking, DeFi staking and locked yield accounts?\n      On-platform bots and DCA automation?\n      Mobile app for trading on the go?\n      Paper trading (simulated trading) capabilities?\n    \n\n    Then, you can use this list as a guide when you're evaluating different platforms.\n  \n  \n    Decide what features are most important to you\n\n    Once you know your trading style, you can start narrowing down the field by considering which features are most important to you. Some features to consider include:\n\n    \n      Ease of use : Platforms can vary greatly in terms of how easy they are to use. If you're not particularly tech-savvy, you'll want to look for a platform that is relatively simple to navigate.\n      Trading fees : Trading platforms range greatly in what they charge for trading fees. Skim through this crypto OTC post where we list the cost of a 100k USD trade on the open market and OTC at several crypto exchanges.\n      Customizability : Some platforms are more customizable than others. If you like being able to tailor your trading experience to your own preferences, you'll want to choose an advanced platform that offers a high degree of customization, like FTX and Bitfinex.\n    \n  \n  \n    Consider the broker's reputation\n\n    When you're looking at trading platforms, it's also important to consider the reputation of the broker that is offering the platform. A broker's reputation can give you a good indication of the quality of their platform.\n\n    In the crypto industry, the reputation of a crypto trading platform can be best determined by talking to other traders. You will get a good idea in some of the smaller Reddit communities like r/BitcoinMarkets.\n\n    To look further into a broker's reputation, it's also a good idea to read user reviews of trading platforms. If there is a lot of complaints about a platform on Reddit, Twitter and Medium, then it shows that the platform is not managed well and on top of it there’s not even a responsive customer support service. You probably want to avoid that platform.\n  \n  \n    Paper trade as a way to test the platform\n\n    Once you've narrowed down your options to a few potential trading platforms, you might prefer to demo trade before committing to using it.\n\n    While paper trading is not very useful in terms of learning to trade, because emotions are not involved there, it will allow you to get a feel for how the platform works and whether or not it's right for you.\n\n    You wouldn't buy a car without taking it for a test drive, and the same goes for trading platforms. By paper trading first, you can get a sense of how easy or difficult the platform is to use, what kind of features are available, and whether the platform suits your needs.\n  \n  \n    Check the customer service\n\n    Once again, an important thing to test on a new trading platform is their customer support.\n\n    This is important in case you ever have any questions or need assistance with using the platform. It is a good tip to help you choose a trading platform because the customer service of a company can tell you a lot about the company. If they are unresponsive or have trouble answering your questions, it may be best to look elsewhere.\n\n    Crypto exchanges are just a piece of software. Whenever you're using a software, there's always a chance that something will go wrong. That's why it's important to choose a platform that offers excellent customer support in case you need any help.\n  \n\n\nKeep in mind that there is no one-size-fits-all trading platform. The best platform for you will depend on your individual needs and preferences. By following the tips above, you should be able to find a platform that suits your needs and helps you trade effectively.\n",

      title: "How to invest in Web3.0: List of opportunities",
      content: "How to invest in Web 3.0, that’s a question that’s been on the top of the mind of a lot of people.\n\nTons of mostly young people are wondering what the next big thing will be in the world of technology, and Web 3.0 is a prime contender.\n\nIn case you live under a rock, the term Web3 or Web3.0 refers to the latest iteration of the online world, which is integrating everything from machine learning and artificial intelligence to augmented reality and the blockchain.\n\nWhile it’s impossible to predict exactly which companies and industries will benefit the most from Web 3.0, there are a number of broad investment opportunities that await those who want to get in on this exciting new technology.\n\nHere are three avenues worth investigating, whether you want to own a part of Web 3.0, or whether you think it’s just a buzzword that will attract a lot of people.\n\n\n  \n    Web3 Crypto Projects: BNB, MATIC, ETH\n\n    Web3 is the latest version of the internet. It has a lot of new features, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence, some of which are already widely used on the internet. One of the things about Web 3.0 that is most relevant here is that it integrates blockchain technology and cryptocurrency payments.\n\n    That’s why you can easily get a stake in Web 3.0 by investing in Web 3.0 tokens of blockchain platforms that focus this way.\n\n    That is done with the purpose of changing how we use the internet for things like shopping and banking. It’s still largely a proof of concept, but there’s already a couple of tools and platforms that have a lot of influence.\n\n    First would be low-fee stablecoins.\n\n    MATIC\n\n    USDC is the stablecoin that has been most universally praised since the Terra crash, and its low fee iteration runs on the MATIC network. That makes Polygon MATIC a candidate for Web3 asset research. The Polygon network hosts a number of platforms for NFTs, staking and DeFi.\n\n    BNB\n\n    On the other hand, it’s USDT that is the most widely used stablecoin, and the standard low fee variation commonly used for commercial payments is Tether on Binance Smart Chain. Binance is a behemoth in the crypto space and its exchange token, BNB, is sometimes considered a Web3 stock - an investment into the future of the holding that runs the Binance exchange and Trust Wallet.\n\n    Another thing is that Binance is at the moment the largest crypto exchange by volume, and holding BNB is tied to such trading benefits that it creates a lot of buy pressure for the coin, no matter what the market conditions are.\n\n    (By the way, you do not need Binance to buy or stake BNB.)\n\n    ETH\n\n    Ethereum is the first blockchain platform designed and developed for Web3. Its scaling is not quite sufficient today and upgrades get delayed, but in spite of that it’s still one of the strongest and most traded cryptocurrencies today. It is the highest priced Web 3.0 cryptocurrency at the moment.\n  \n  \n    DeFi and staking cryptocurrencies\n\n    For many of those who are interested in dabbing into Web3 tools, decentralized finance will be the perfect place to start. There are rather complex DeFi protocols like Curve and others, but as staking got popular, easy-to-use tools started popping up as well.\n\n    These days, DeFi staking and cold staking of a variety cryptocurrencies is the kind of investment that most people in the community consider the safest - or perhaps considered, until LUNA. The possibility of a crash is one of the risks of DeFi, even if you hold your coins in your own wallet, and even if you stake a stablecoin.\n\n    Technically speaking though, it is easy to participate in Web3 economy and earn interest-like income with DeFi, because in the simplest iteration you just need to hold a cryptocurrency in a staking wallet or on an exchange with staking pools, such as Binance.\n\n    The most popular coins to cold-stake in 2022 are ADA, ETH2, XTZ and TRX and you can do that directly from wallets like Exodus or Ledger. DeFi staking pays the best for small cryptos…whatever is on the menu at Binance.\n  \n  \n    NFTs &amp; Metaverse item - also obtainable via airdrops and bounties\n\n    NFTs started off as collectibles and artworks, then carried on to disrupt the world of gaming and the next logical step is Metaverse. That’s because NFTs can encode any unique information, such as a contract to a piece of land or property.\n\n    In the real world, there was always the same issue with blockchain solutions for luxury goods tracking or provenance: How to trustlessly encode something material into a blockchain that is purely virtual. But in Metaverse everything is virtual and so that problem is eliminated.\n\n    Metaverse is a Web3-based application that allows users to own, use or create virtual assets. These assets can be anything from land and property to artwork items and avatar-like characters. Sure enough, projects that encode NFTs for a piece of land have been showing up in our airdrop section regularly in 2022 and there have been a couple of expensive land sales in Metaverse even before.\n\n    Metaverse is still in its early stages, but it has the potential (and the PR) to become a major player in the world of Web 3.0. And since you can obtain Metaverse items through airdrops, there’s this great opportunity to get involved in this exciting new technology literally just for a couple of tweets.\n  \n\n\nAnd that’s it. If you’re looking for a way to invest some of your money in web3, any of these three options is an easy but reasonable way to go. Each has its own unique benefits that are worth exploring in more depth.\n\nIf you’re interested in holding a cryptocurrency that focuses on web3, check out this guide to buying BNB without KYC. If you want to own an NFT of a Metaverse item, take a look at Decentraland. And finally, if you’re interested in taking part in DeFi, staking cryptocurrencies are definitely worth checking out. Don’t try to forget you’re meant to pay taxes on all that, and always do your own research.\n",

      title: "In-Depth: Why Are Young Investors Putting Their Money in Cryptocurrency?",
      content: "These days, investing for young adults usually means building a portfolio of cryptocurrencies rather than traditional assets such as stocks and bonds.\n\nOver the last few years, especially younger millennials and members of Generation Z have funneled large fractions of their savings into these new alternative assets. They also tend to be staunch advocates of both cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, which powers it.\n\nCurious to know what it is about cryptocurrencies that have so captured the minds and portfolios of so many young investors?\n\nRead on for an in-depth look at some major reasons crypto has become a favored investing product among the youth.\n\n\n  \n    Positive Outlook on the Technology\n\n    While many young people do scalp trade crypto for the chance of turning a quick profit, a good number choose to DCA and hold their favorite coins long-term because they believe in the value of the technology itself.\n\n    These long-term holders see cryptocurrency as potentially applicable and useful for the years to come, some even going so far as to consider it \"the future of finance.\"\n\n    Some young investors are interested in the ways cryptocurrencies can be used to help the disenfranchised in countries with limited economic freedom. Privacy coins like the highly secure and specially encrypted Monero, for instance, can only be stored through a dedicated XMR wallet. The Monero technology allows for fully anonymous, secure transfers of the coin that aren't vulnerable to intervention from governments or other regulatory bodies.\n\n    Crypto exchanges (particularly no-KYC exchanges that support privacy coins like Monero) have thus allowed people born in disadvantaged regions to receive money from relatives abroad, without exposing themselves or the relatives to any risk of scrutiny.\n\n    Other young crypto enthusiasts are particularly interested in the potential applications and future value of the blockchain, the foundational technology behind cryptocurrency. Blockchain is a digital ledger that's distributed across a network of computers instead of being controlled by any single organization or individual.\n\n    Devotees of crypto believe that blockchain's decentralized construction makes it a secure, transparent repository for financial transactions and other important information.\n  \n  \n    Loss of Faith in Traditional Financial Institutions\n\n    Younger millennials and members of Gen Z will have grown up exposed to the harsh realities of global recessions, financial crises, mortgage debt crash and bailouts, quantitative easing and generally speaking economic uncertainty.\n\n    This exposure has not only made them cautious and careful about their finances, but also diminished their inclination to trust traditional financial systems. Many have come to see banks and other conventional financial institutions as inefficient and inequitable, if not outright exploitative.\n\n    To these investors, many of whom feel deprived of opportunities to acquire and build wealth through conventional means, cryptocurrency presents a promising shot at greater economic mobility.\n\n    Some may also see crypto trading as a means of pushing back against financial systems that have failed to support their generation in the ways that they need.\n  \n  \n    Ease of Access\n\n    Cryptocurrency platforms of 2022 pride themselves on their accessibility. This has historically been a major selling point with investors of all ages and in all kinds of markets.\n\n    A new investor can create an account with a crypto exchange with relative ease, sometimes even without identifying themselves since the law is still unclear on that issue in most countries. Then they can immediately receive access to the wealth of investing opportunities and trading products the platform provides.\n\n    Take Binance for instance: With just a smartphone, you can buy crypto there, trade its derivatives, stake it, farm it or put it in a locked interest-bearing account. The options that investors get on crypto platforms are simply not even in the same ballpark as what you get in a bank nowadays.\n\n    Compare this to traditional investing, where the process of even setting oneself up as an investor is fraught with so many complications. New participants are often compelled to study a multitude of complexities before they can even begin trading through a brokerage account.\n\n    Most cryptocurrencies also do not have an IPO, which means that both retail investors and venture capitalists have roughly the same opportunities to support and earn returns on crypto projects.\n\n    Given all this, it's unsurprising that young people would avoid investing in stocks in favor of more accessible alternatives.\n  \n  \n    Sense of Community\n\n    It's possible to trace at least some of the younger generation's interest in crypto to the ubiquity of the internet, social media, and other digital technology in their lives.\n\n    A recent study by Hargreaves Lansdown PLC, for instance, found that up to 60% of investors under 40 years of age preferred to get their investing advice on social media platforms like Reddit and YouTube.\n\n    Crypto proponents naturally maintain a strong presence in the online forum culture, ready to welcome novice traders into their ever-growing online communities. The power this sense of community has to attract young investors to crypto spaces can't be understated, especially during the post-pandemic times.\n\n    Besides the alluring promise of great economic returns, many young people find that participating in crypto communities removes their loneliness and sense of social isolation. They thus come to see these online spaces as trustworthy sources of advice on viable crypto projects, as well as spaces for community discussion or support in the event of failed investments.\n\n    Some young investors also relish the opportunity to be part of an active movement. Many crypto holders are eager to find more involved ways to further support the projects they invest in. They may act as marketers and community managers in online spaces, and their actions in those spaces can and often do help drive the markets.\n  \n\n\nBottom line\n\nAt the end of the day, young investors' interest in cryptocurrencies is in large part a reflection of the technological, social, and economic realities that have shaped their lives.\n\nThese new and radically divergent investing behaviors in turn have the potential to help reshape the global financial landscape in years to come.\n",

      title: "Best trading platforms for scalping crypto (List for 2022)",
      content: "Looking for the best crypto scalping exchange? Yeah, that’s paramount in scalping trading strategies.\n\nEveryone who ever dealt with an untriggered stop loss knows that finding the right exchange is crucial when it comes to scalping crypto. That’s why this list of best exchanges for crypto scalping exists.\n\nIt is so important to use the right exchange to scalp trade crypto, and the reason is that scalping is a trading strategy which relies on taking small profits (or losses) relatively often. One losing trade left uncut due to your exchange crashing down can wipe out months of your work.\n\nWhat makes a good scalping exchange?\n\n\n  Scalping needs you to be able to execute trades quickly and at the price you want.\n  Your limit and stop orders need to actually trigger when they are meant to.\n  The exchange fees need to be low because you will execute a lot of trades.\n\n\nGenerally speaking, best trading platform for scalping crypto will be one of the largest exchanges, because you need liquidity on the books to get in and out of your trade easily.\n\nScalping alt coins on smaller exchanges like Bitforex or LATOKEN might seem convenient, because they don’t require KYC and list some of the smaller alts that you can’t get elsewhere. However, Bitforex for one reportedly fakes their trading volume by printing copies of orders from larger exchanges. That will make for a bottleneck in your scalping trades.\n\nBest trading platforms for scalping crypto\n\nAll of the exchanges listed below are a good choice.\n\nBut to make things even clearer, we’ve ranked them by technical reliability, fees and spreads, so that you can maximize your scalping profits and keep your counter party risks as low as possible.\n\n\n  \n    FTX - 5% fee off on Intl or on US\n\n    FTX offers a fairer, faster, and more reliable trading environment. They have perpetual contracts of most assets as well as volatility contracts for them. Those are industry-first products that might change the way you trade - they are easier to understand than binary options but allow you to easily hedge on volatility ahead without having to speculate on the direction.\n\n    FTX offers some of the lowest brokerage fees in the industry. On any spot or derivative markets, new FTX accounts pay the fees of 0.02% for maker or 0.07% for taker. To that you can add the 5% referral code discount and possibly the exchange token discount. The fee discounts for FTT token holders kick in once you hold more than 100 USD worth of the exchange token.\n\n    This all means that you can set a stop loss with confidence knowing that you won’t be charged abusive fees. On top of that, there are volume discounts, but they only start at 2 MM traded volume.\n\n    Scalping bots for FTX\n\n    There are scalping bots available for FTX via Coinrule. For a scalping strategy without technical analysis, you can run a shadow grid directly on FTX through their native automation tool (the Quant Zone).\n\n    Sign up at FTX now and get 5% off your trading fees. You’ll also gain access to the innovative products and experience a level of service that is second to none.\n  \n  \n    Binance - 10% fee off on Intl\n\n    Binance is the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world. As of now, Binance still offers a 25% fee discount if your trading fees are paid in the exchange token (BNB).\n\n    The promo is set to expire in July 2022 and without it, the fee structure on Binance is not all that attractive.\n\n    One useful thing for scalpers is that Binance charges the same fee for maker and taker. It’s 0.1% for new accounts (or 0.075% with the BNB fee discount). That means you can use market stops and market orders without paying a significantly higher fee. You will still have some losses on slippage, though.\n\n    Fee discounts for traded volume on Binance only kick in over 1MM BUSD traded, or with holdings of at least 25 BNB on the exchange,\n\n    The main appeal of Binance is that you can use your finger to quickly swipe between trading, cold staking and yield farming pools, so everything feels fluid and effortless. No need to move money between wallets and exchanges, you’ve got everything under one roof.\n\n    Scalping bots for Binance are available via Coinrule.\n  \n  \n    Bitfinex - 6% regressing discount, no KYC\n\n    Bitfinex will always be the hero platform for everyone who is tired of exchanges that don’t have the liquidity that’s needed for good scalping. There’s no KYC for most markets and 6% fee discount with a shill link, but fees for stop losses can get expensive.\n\n    The stop markets charge 0.1% for makers with new accounts on Bitfinex, the taker fee is double however, that’s 0.2%. On the derivative markets the fees are much friendlier towards scalpers - they are 0.02% and 0.065% maker and taker for new accounts.\n\n    Bitfinex offers order books with top tier liquidity, allowing users to easily scalp Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Monero, Litecoin and many other digital assets with minimal slippage. New sh1tcoins get listed quickly, and they get promptly delisted once the hype wears off and the books start thinning out.\n\n    The slippage on Bitfinex is in fact lower even in big cryptos when compared to what you see on FTX and most other exchanges - that can be easily verified by checking the recent BTCUSD charts on TradingView.\n\n    Liquidity providers can generate yield by providing funding to traders wanting to trade with leverage. Funding is traded on an order book, so you can get in on the action and help others get the trades they need.\n\n    Scalping bots for Bitfinex available via Coinrule.\n\n    Sign up now and start trading on Bitfinex with 6% fee discount if you start trading right away! No KYC needed at the moment.\n  \n\n\nNot convinced it’s worth it?\n\nIf you are looking for a way to trade cryptocurrencies but scalping didn’t convince you, read the following list to help you decide which crypto trading strategy would be the best for you.\n\nScalping without TA: Grid or Shadow\n\nGrid trading and shadow grid trading are techniques used mainly in the foreign exchange market.\n\nBy placing buy and sell orders at certain regular intervals above and below a predefined base price, grid trading seeks to capitalize on normal price volatility in an asset.\n\nWith a good money management and stop losses, you could potentially make good money without any technical analysis mysticism, just by using grid trading in the crypto exchange market.\n\nMore on various types of grid trading.\n\nArbitrage\n\nWe’ve all heard of arbitrage trading - buying and selling the same asset in different markets to profit from price discrepancies. It’s not risky, if you manage the logistics of it well, which can be tricky.\n\nBut what if there was a way to do this automatically, without having to constantly watch the markets? - Obviously, you can. With an arbitrage trading bot, you can set it and forget it. The bot will automatically buy and sell assets on your behalf, so you can focus on other things while still making a profit.\n\nWill you make a lot of money on that? Well, if a lot means a life changing amount, then no, probably not.\n\nBut there are ways that still make an arbitrage bot pay handsomely.\n\nSwing trading\n\nInterested in trading on a longer scale than a few hours per trade?\n\nThen swing trading may be the perfect investment strategy for you. This style of trading can be used to capture gains in a stock over a period of days or weeks, and it relies primarily on technical analysis to identify opportunities.\n\nWith swing trading, you can make money whether the market is going up or down. You’ll have the opportunity to profit from both bull and bear markets, so you can generate consistent profits no matter what the market is doing.\n\nDCA &amp; Hodl\n\nLast but not least, there’s the the buy and hold strategy, because speculative trading can be difficult. Figuring out when to buy, sell, and cut losses does get overwhelming.\n\nDollar-cost averaging removes the guesswork from investing. You don’t have to worry about trying to time the market – you just need to have a good reason to be long term bullish about an asset.\n\nBy buying a fixed dollar amount of a security at fixed intervals, regardless of the security’s price, you are buying more shares when prices are low and fewer shares when prices are high. This reduces your average purchase price and helps minimize the effects of volatility on your investment portfolio.\n\nLearn more about the projected returns of DCA in Bitcoin vs the portfolio gains from crypto’s price appreciation with the simple buy and hold strategy.\n\nBottom line\n\nCrypto scalping is a trading strategy that can be used to make quick profits. It involves buying and selling coins quickly, so you need to be prepared before you start.\n\nWith the right tools, you can maximize your chances in scalping trading, but at the same time, scalping is not for everyone.\n",

      title: "6 Tips To Become A Better Online Trader (Checklist)",
      content: "Are you looking to get better at online trading? You are definitely not alone in this pursuit.\n\nIn today's world, more and more people are choosing to trade stocks or currencies online. This is for a number of reasons - the economic situation, the amount of dead-end jobs out there, but also just a desire to try it out.\n\nOnline trading does offer a number of advantages over traditional methods such as investing through a broker and does make investing accessible to a much wider audience.\n\nHowever, in order to be successful, you need to have the right tools and a rudimentary knowledge of the markets and industries you’re interested in.\n\nHere’s a checklist of six important points that you shouldn’t be missing if you want to become a better trader.\n\n6 Tips To Become A Better Online Trader (Checklist)\n\n\n  \n    Set Your Priorities\n\n    The first point on this checklist is to make sure that you have a clear understanding of what you want to achieve.\n\n    What are your priorities and investment goals?\n\n    Are you looking to hedge your portfolio or are you hoping to generate income through trading? Once you know your goals, it will be much easier to develop a strategy that will help you achieve them.\n\n    For example, a common goal for many investors is to earn regular income through trading. If this is your goal, then you will want to focus on strategies that are designed to do just that.\n\n    On the other hand, if your goal is to set up a diverse portfolio to hold for maybe a decade, then you will want to focus on techniques strategies that can help you accomplish that.\n\n    Buy and hold strategies may include buying assets that have the potential to appreciate in value over time. Similarly, you can expect to take on more short-term risk if your goal is to generate income through trading.\n  \n  \n    Setup A Crypto Fund\n\n    If you want to trade cryptocurrencies in the long run, then judging from the tightening regulatory requirements, you might need to set up a dedicated cryptocurrency fund. It’s just a legal way to separate your crypto investments from your other income or assets.\n\n    On top of that, crypto funds can be used to trade other assets such as stocks and futures which can be useful when cryptocurrency markets trade sideways.\n\n    In the United States, one way to set up a cryptocurrency fund is to use a service that let you create the tax-advantaged IRA retirement accounts. There are a couple of providers of IRA and 401(k) retirement accounts for digital assets. With any of them, you can easily and securely set up a cryptocurrency fund that will help you reach your investment goals.\n\n    But you don’t need to set up a fund in your own country at all. It may be a good idea to set up this fund in a jurisdiction that is more favorable to cryptocurrency trading and already has a solid regulatory framework in place. In Europe, Estonia and the United Kingdom are two such locations.\n  \n  \n    Get Educated\n\n    The third point is to get educated and to keep educating yourself.\n\n    Before you start trading, it is important to learn as much as you can about the process. There are a number of resources out there that can help you learn about online trading.\n\n    The most valuable ones include books, in-depth articles and Telegram groups for quant traders or market analysts.\n\n    By getting educated, you will be better equipped to make successful trades because you will know about the tools that can actually give you an edge in the markets.\n\n    If you trade cryptocurrencies, it is also important to keep up with the latest news and developments in that fast changing industry. This will help you identify opportunities as well as avoid potential pitfalls.\n  \n  \n    Develop A Strategy\n\n    Having a strategy is one of the most important tips for becoming a successful online trader.\n\n    Without a strategy, it will be purely in the hands of luck whether you make any profits or not.\n\n    There are a number of different strategies out there and it is important to find one that suits your goals, time availability and also your personality.\n\n    For instance, scalping is a popular strategy in the crypto markets, but it requires you to trade multiple times a day. That’s absolutely not for everybody. On the other hand, there are scalping bots out there that can do the work for you.\n  \n  \n    Have Patience\n\n    Patience is definitely a virtue when it comes to online trading. This is because some markets can be volatile within the day and there will be times when it may take a while for your otherwise sound trades to generate profits.\n\n    However, if you are patient and able to manage your financial strategy, the long-term results will be worth it. The way to achieve this is by setting realistic goals and not expecting to make a fortune overnight.\n\n    Even if your goal is just to generate an extra $500 per month, you should not put that pressure on yourself and expect to achieve this within your first month of trading. It may take several months or even a year to reach this goal but if you are patient and your strategy is reasonable, it will be well worth it in the end.\n  \n  \n    Stay Disciplined\n\n    The final point to check is staying disciplined. Once you have developed a strategy, it is important to stick to it. This means not deviating from your plan no matter what. There will be times when it may be tempting to do so but it is important to resist the urge.\n\n    Discipline in trading means following your strategy no matter what and not letting emotions get in the way.\n\n    For example, you should never enter into a trade just because you are feeling angry or frustrated. Emotions do a good job in clouding your judgment, which leads to poor decision-making.\n\n    By staying disciplined, you will be far more likely to make successful trades and generate profits over the long term.\n  \n\n\nFinal words\n\nSo there you have it, six tips that will help you become a better online trader.\n\nBy making sure you check every item on the list above, you will be on a good way to profit. Just remember to always do your research, stick to your strategy, manage your money well and remain patient and disciplined.\n\nThese are the keys to success in any form of trading. Good luck!\n",

      title: "Crypto Staking Taxes in the US - Overview & Tools",
      content: "Are you confused about how to report your crypto staking earnings on your taxes?\n\nYou’re not alone. In the United States, the IRS has yet to provide clear guidance on how to treat staking income and revenue offices in most other countries are in a similar position.\n\nThat’s where tax accountants come in. They are experts in tax implications and will figure out how to report your staking income for you.\n\nBut just so that you can look over their shoulder, here’s what is known about taxation on staking income in 2022.\n\nStaking yield is a freelance income, regardless of whether you sell or not\n\nWhile the IRS does not provide specific guidelines for crypto staking taxes, it does provide rules for crypto mining and for airdrops.\n\n\n  Crypto mining profits are treated as a regular income. In the USA, the tax on that crypto revenue is the same as for your freelance earnings. (IRS Notice 2014-21)\n  Crypto airdrops are taxable in the same way as mining, but only if the rewarded token can be freely traded at the moment of distribution. (Revenue Ruling 2019-24)\n\n\nAccording to Berdon LLP, this means that at least for the moment until a more specific guidance is available, staking profits should be reported as a freelance income as long as the staked cryptocurrency was openly trading on exchanges when you got it into your staking wallet.\n\nFor your staking tax report, just like it is with tax on crypto airdrops, it does not matter whether you actually sold the cryptocurrency or not. The income is still counted regardless, and that’s at the value of the token when it was distributed into your wallet.\n\nCapital gains are only applicable if you sell\n\nSo, the tax implication of staking crypto is always an income tax, treated as a freelance income.\n\nTo this freelance income tax on your staking profits you might need to add a capital gains tax. In the United States, you only pay capital gains tax when you sell the cryptocurrency. There are two tiers, depending whether you held the crypto for at least a year or whether you sold before that mark.\n\nIf you are selling your crypto staking profits, then you are liable to pay capital gains tax on the difference between the fair price of that cryptoasset when you received it as staking yield and the price at which you sold it. A fair price can be a rate of that day as reported by Google or by Yahoo Finance.\n\nIf you decide to hold onto your staking profits, you will (legally) avoid the capital gains tax, but you still need to pay taxes on the staking income.\n\nYou need to pay staking income tax even in case the value of that crypto dropped\n\nA widely known way to legally avoid paying capital gains tax on your crypto is to offset it with capital losses.\n\nStaking yield is not a capital gain, though. In the US, the netting rule applies between gains and losses on capital, but you can offset 3000 USD of your ordinary income by a capital loss as well. Over that amount, there is no way to offset your income tax which at the moment includes the tax on your staking yields.\n\nIf you have a crypto portfolio, you might easily find some unrealized losses to net. But remember that in order for the IRS to accept the offset, you have to have actually sold the crypto. Unrealized losses will do you no good, tax-wise.\n\nLast important thing to remember is that you need to consider the tax year. Any crypto transaction that you want to use on your tax report needs to be cleared before the end of the tax year.\n\nIt’s allowed to cherry pick your assets to sell at loss just before the year’s end, and this is called “tax loss harvesting”, but you cannot decide that you want to lower your last year’s capital gains in April and start selling.\n\nTools to help you with crypto staking tax, taxes on DeFi and taxable crypto airdrops\n\nThere are a couple of tools that help mainly with crypto taxes for traders. Those are capital gains and so these tools are mainly aiming at helping with the offset between gains and losses.\n\nAn (unlikely) tool that will be more useful for those of you who earn yields from cold staking and DeFi staking is surprisingly the Ledger wallet.\n\n\n\nLedger now offers a tax reporting tool called ZenLedger. It’s available from the Ledger’s Live app and it does not matter which model of Ledger you have.\n\nSince Ledger is itself a staking wallet, the Zenledger tool reports primarily your income from mining, staking, lending, airdrops, forks and even NFT rewards that landed into your addresses within the Ledger wallet. But you can plug in your exchange logs as well.\n\nZenLedger is built for the US crypto taxation rules, but at the moment it can be used anywhere around world. All Zenledger does is it automatically extracts all the information about your taxable activities without any extra bookkeeping work on your end. Just have the output checked by an accountant if you’re not sure what the rules in your country are.\n\n\n  Here’s more about Zenledger at the Ledger wallet blog.\n\n\nBottom line\n\nYou shouldn’t have too much trouble finding an accountant knowledgable in crypto anymore. The market is getting more competitive and as cryptocurrencies become more mainstream, the demand for crypto-friendly accountants will only grow.\n\nHowever, it never hurts to have some independent knowledge of the process yourself, just so you can check on your accountant’s work.\n\nThat’s why we put this article together - to arm you with the basics of how crypto taxes work so that you can be knowledgeable and prepared when meeting with your accountant.\n",

      title: "For your reference: What does a FED rate hike mean for crypto?",
      content: "The relationship between interest rate policies and prices of crypto has been a hot topic. It is often disputed that there could even be a relationship because when you take market data over the past few years, you will find that crypto has on average no correlation with legacy markets.\n\nIf you take NASDAQ and BTCUSD on TradingView and look at them side by side (here’s how to do that), the picture looks different. It is beyond any doubt that there are at least periods of correlation between the legacy tech sector and crypto.\n\n\n\nNASDAQ vs BTCUSD vs CIX on May 13, 2022\n\nOne possible reason for this is that institutional money is now the largest participant on the crypto markets. In their thinking, crypto is a close to a kind of tech stock, which is why their bots are programmed to trade it as such.\n\nLooking at it from this angle, the FED rate hikes must have an impact on crypto as well as on stocks. (As a note, ECB’s interest rate policies as well, but to a lesser extent.)\n\nProbably most accurate way to put it is that the opinion of US-based institutional traders on FED’s interest rates is what has impact.\n\nBut just for the reference, let’s first look at the basic theory of how do interest rates affect stocks and crypto.\n\nInterest rates and stock or crypto markets\n\n\n  Rule of thumb: FED rate hike makes markets go down. FED rate cut makes markets go up.\n\n\nThe Federal Reserve issues monetary policy with the following two aims: First is to manage inflation to protect people from undue rise in costs of living. The second is to keep unemployment low.\n\nWhen the FED cuts interest rates, it means that borrowing money gets cheaper.\n\nIn theory, this should stimulate economy: People will be happy to spend, businesses will be happy to borrow and invest.\n\nIn practice, a common impact is that stock markets go up, because it is cheap to borrow money and speculate. This is said to bring about speculative bubbles.\n\nWhen FED rises interest rates, it cools off the speculative bubbles because it becomes expensive to borrow money for speculations.\n\nThe true purpose of interest rate hikes is to manage inflation though. Central banks have their targets for inflation and once that gets out of hand, they are mandated to do something about it.\n\nIn the markets, higher interest rates can incentivize investors to sell any assets they perceive as risky. The reason for this behavior is that as it gets more expensive to borrow money, it is no longer rational to use that money to speculate on stocks because the returns on stocks are low.\n\nBy this logic, traders shouldn’t go and sell if the realistic returns on those investments were higher than the cost of borrowing money. On the stock market, high returns are not to be expected. They are not that rare in some of the high-tech stocks and they are absolutely not uncommon at all in crypto.\n\nBut even so, investor decisions after a rate hike typically end up lowering the prices overall because they create a risk-off environment.\n\nLast rate hike to date: May 4, 2022\n\nHere is the NASDAQ comparison again, with May 4th marked by the vertical line.\n\n\n\nLast FED hike to date was on May 4, 2022. The FED hiked rates by half a percentage point to fight inflation. This was the biggest hike in two decades.\n\nHow did the market react? Stocks and crypto rose for a few days prior to the meeting and kept rising until the results of the meeting were out. Stocks leaped higher following the announcement, but topped out in the next days and turned into a downtrend.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, when the FED cuts interest rates, the stock market goes up. When the FED raises interest rates, it causes the stock market to go down.\n\nThe immediate price action in May 2022 was the opposite of the rule of thumb. Some explain it away by having the rate hike priced in. As a matter of fact, some traders expected the rate hike to be bigger). If the rate hike was smaller than expected, it could be read as a relatively good news and cause the markets go up.\n\nOthers explain that price action by the fact that it is not a good short entry if it doesn’t start at a local top. Also, eventually the long-term economic conditions are bound to prevail and show up in the price action.\n\nEither way, there is no guarantee as to how the market will react to any given interest rate change, especially in the short term.\n\nSome speculate two steps ahead\n\nReacting on interest rate is just speculation. It has something in common with technical analysis in that it can be a self-fulfilling prophecy: It is known that this is how traders react and so people try to front run each other.\n\nSome traders also like to think two steps ahead, in a contrarian way. An analyst commented for MarketWatch that he believes this rate hiking cycle will be short. He thinks the FED will rise interest rates fast only so that they can cut them soon again. His opinion would have him start building a long position.\n\nSocial media likes this sentiment, including some of the crypto communities. A popular sentiment is to speculate that the last rate hike will increase unemployment figures, which would be a good reason for FED to start cutting rates again - especially in the current macro conditions.\n\nJust for the record, the ECB president said on May 11th, 2022 that ECB will probably rise rates in July. ECB officials are concerned that the situation in Ukraine will keep inflation high, embed expectations of rising prices among consumers and companies and damage the economy.\n\nBottom line\n\nThe rule of thumb is that stocks go down as long as interest rates go up and crypto follows as long as the current correlation holds, which is not going to be forever. Even so, trading on interest rate changes is not a set-in-stone thing, especially not in the short term.\n",

      title: "Pros And Cons Of Automated Arbitrage Trading",
      content: "Are emotions getting in your way of making profitable trades, even in arbitrage trading?\n\nOr are you new to crypto trading and just wish for an easy strategy that can bring returns from the trading floor? Then you should know that automated arbitrage trading can take care of your trading business while concentrating on other crucial things.\n\nArbitrage trading takes advantage of market inefficiencies caused by crypto market volatility to make profits. It’s a low-risk and low-return investment strategy that entails shopping for price discrepancies in several financial markets and buying when low and selling high.\n\nSo, you don’t need to sharpen your trading skills to enjoy the market price swings.\nWhen you add automation to arbitrage trading strategy, you’re handing over the analysis of the markets to programmed software.\n\nThe software will do the hard work by matching your trading frameworks with favorable crypto market conditions to profit.\n\nHowever, automated arbitrage trading depends on the intermediary markets and crypto exchanges who give you access to trading. So, you must begin by looking for an arbitrage trading platform before introducing arbitrage bots in your crypto trading business.\n\nIn this article we will elaborate on the pros and cons to using an automated arbitrage trading strategy. Read on.\n\nPros\n\nListed below are the pros of using automated arbitrage trading.\n\n\n  \n    Controlled Emotions\n\n    The crypto market price action moves very fast for you to spot trading opportunities, and it can throw your trading strategy off and result in losses. And even if you get a lucky strike, your emotions might get the best of you and prompt you to press the panic button and leave the trading floor just before your trades turn blue.\n\n    With automated arbitrage, your emotions are part of the trading conditions. The software will comb through the market structure or formation to find clear criteria to open trade positions following your rules. Bots such as Pionex won’t hesitate to execute a trade if opportunities are to capitalize on the market swings.\n  \n  \n    Allows Backtesting and Dry Runs\n\n    The viability of automated arbitrage trading relies on the historical data collected from the market price. You can review the previous market price actions to tweak your automated arbitrage strategy.\n\n    In addition, the software can’t guess which signals to follow when entering the trading floor. So, you have an opportunity to define what your automated arbitrage trading should be and backtest against the market history before going live. It’ll furnish the software with guidelines and help you derive realistic expectations from using the strategy.\n  \n  \n    Diversification\n\n    Diversification is a classic strategy that’s applicable in automated arbitrage trading too. You have an opportunity to open multiple trade accounts, spread your risks across several cryptoassets, and hedge your trades.\n\n    For instance, you can run one arbitrage trading bot on markets denominated in USD or a fiat-pegged stablecoin and another bot on markets denominated in BTC. This way you can collect profits in both USD and BTC.\n\n    In effect, this is similar to running a DCA bot in Bitcoin and will create diversification in the assets that you plan holding for the long run.\n  \n  \n    Command Bound\n\n    Once you set the arbitrage rules, the system is command bound and will automatically follow the predetermined trading system. The software will keep calm when the market becomes volatile and maintain discipline by referring to your rules. Also, it’ll be sharp to detect false moves and panic to exit a trading position.\n\n    Likewise, if there’s an opportunity to capitalize, it’ll stick to your instructions and attempt to go overboard by opening more trades than your account can handle.\n  \n\n\nCons\n\nIf there are advantages to using the automated arbitrary system, there are also cons, and here are some of them.\n\n\n  \n    Mechanical Hitch\n\n    The internet is a crucial component for automated arbitrage trading, and it can create other failures in your strategy. You can set your software to trade at the next opportunity, but a human error in the bot’s code will sabotage your plan. This is why backtesting of your automated strategies is so important.\n\n    But even so, exchange systems might create a mismatch between your automated arbitrage set-up and the market executions. Such mechanical hitches can result in significant losses and may discourage you from trading.\n  \n  \n    Constant Monitoring\n\n    This is especially relevant if you run a custom arbitrage bot. If you do not want to waste time on tech monitoring, use a commercial trading bot platform that offers arbitrage strategies.\n\n    The thing is, once you have a test run of the automated trading system and it’s working, you will assume that things will remain constant.\n\n    However, even automated arbitrage trading systems can encounter technical problems and leave your trades hanging on the trading floor. It’s prudent to monitor the functionality of your automation setup and ensure it serves its purpose.\n  \n  \n    Overdependency\n\n    It’s easy to develop overdependency on the automated arbitrage trading systems and throw caution to the wind when going trading live.\n\n    In addition, if technological advancement will not make your automated arbitrage system obsolete, then the increased amount of arbitrage traders will. Therefore it is best to make use of the opportunity while it lasts, but avoid relying on it solely.\n  \n\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThe crypto markets experience high magnitude volatility for humans to keep up with the price action. If you’re careful, you can enjoy a good stint in the market and come out with profits.\n\nLuckily, the crypto landscape allows trade automation to help you capitalize on the market inefficiencies. But you must learn how they work and what are the exchange platforms that encourage traders to use software for arbitrage trading.\n",

      title: "Pros And Cons Of Investing In Gold IRA vs Cryptocurrencies",
      content: "The world of finance is ever-changing, and with the rise of cryptocurrencies, even some investors with legacy asset preferences are looking to invest in cryptocurrencies.\n\nBitcoin, Solana or Monero are cryptocurrencies that have seen their values skyrocket in recent years, leading many people to believe that they are smart investments. Gold IRA, on the other hand, is a more traditional investment with variable returns, but one that people never stopped considering to retain value permanently.\n\nHowever, as with any important decision, there are pros and cons to investing in both gold IRA and cryptocurrencies that must be addressed when you’re choosing in which to invest.\n\nIn this article, we will outline six important pros and cons you should consider if you want to understand investing in gold IRA and crypto and make an informed decision.\n\nInvesting in Gold\n\n\n  \n    Pro: Gold is a low-risk investment\n\n    The first major advantage of investing in gold is that it has historically been a very stable investment.\n\n    Unlike other investments, such as stocks or crypto, the price of gold does not fluctuate wildly from day to day like these types of assets do. And that include the biggest of cryptocurrencies, that are relatively stable when compared to some of the smaller crypto coins.\n\n    Historically, the value of precious metals tends to rise slowly and steadily over time, making it a low-risk and lower yield option for investors who want to protect their wealth without having to worry about market volatility.\n\n    It is also a good solution for those who are looking to hedge against inflation, as gold typically rises in value when the cost of living goes up. That’s how gold it can help offset some of the impact of inflation on your portfolio.\n  \n  \n    Pro: Gold is a liquid investment\n\n    Another big advantage of gold is that it can be easily sold for cash if you ever need to.\n\n    This is not always the case with other types of investments, such as real estate or even stocks, which can sometimes be difficult to sell quickly. If you need to access your money for an emergency, gold will be much easier to liquidate than other types of investments.\n\n    All you have to do is find a gold dealer in your area, which is usually not a problem. They will be able to buy your gold from you and give you cash on the spot. You may also find dealers who are willing to buy gold bullion online, making it even more convenient to sell your gold when you need access to the funds. Just be sure to research the dealer before you sell to them to ensure that they are reputable and will give you a fair price for your gold.\n  \n  \n    Con: Gold is a physical commodity\n\n    One of the downsides to gold is that it is a physical commodity, which means it can be stolen or lost if you're not careful with it.\n\n    Unlike stocks or bonds, which are stored electronically, physical gold must be stored in a physical location, such as a safe deposit box or a home safe. Other forms of gold investments that do not involve physical gold are not considered as good an investment.\n\n    This means that if your gold is stolen or lost, it can be very difficult to replace. Therefore, it's important to take measures to protect your gold, such as storing it in a safe place and keeping it insured against theft or loss.\n\n    The easiest way to invest in physical gold is to purchase a Gold IRA, which is a special account that you can use to store your gold and keep it safe.\n  \n\n\nInvesting in Cryptocurrencies\n\n\n  \n    Pro: Investing in cryptocurrencies has potentially higher returns\n\n    While investing in gold is a more traditional way to invest your money, investing in cryptocurrencies has attracted a lot of attention due to the profits that some investors managed to extract out of the cryptocurrency markets.\n\n    There are many different digital currencies available, with Bitcoin being still the most popular options. But with the advances in altcoin markets and the new popularity of memecoins, NFTs and DeFi, there is always something new and exciting happening in the cryptocurrency world that can make for a good investment, if you make the right call.\n\n    Plus, it's easy to buy or sell cryptocurrencies online in just a few minutes using trading platforms and your bank account. Storing cryptocurrencies can then yield passive income with next to no risk due to various staking options that wallets and exchanges now have.\n  \n  \n    Con: Crypto is a high-risk investment\n\n    The biggest downside of crypto investing is that these investments are incredibly volatile and can fluctuate very quickly from day to day.\n\n    This means that you could lose a large percentage of your investment in just a few minutes if the markets suddenly change direction, so it's important to be psychologically prepared for this possibility if you choose to invest in cryptocurrencies.\n\n    However, with careful research and diversification, you can minimize the risks associated with investing in digital currencies to help protect yourself against potential losses.\n  \n  \n    Con: Cryptocurrencies are hard to regulate\n\n    Another major disadvantage of cryptocurrency is that it is technically an anonymous investment option.\n\n    Unlike with gold IRA, there is no central registry that tracks who owns what digital currency. This means that if you lose your coins or if they are stolen, there is little way to track down the owner and get them back.\n\n    While this anonymity can be beneficial in some situations, it also makes it very difficult to recover your investment if something goes wrong. Therefore, you need to be extra careful when storing and using your cryptocurrencies to help minimize the risks of losing them.\n  \n\n\nBottom line\n\nBy weighing the risks and rewards of each type of investment, you can make a more informed decision about whether buying a gold IRA or investing in cryptocurrencies is the right choice for you.\n\nWhether you choose to invest in one or both of these options, you should always do your research and consult a financial advisor before making any financial decisions.\n\nHowever, with careful planning and research, you can make a wise decision and make the most out of both gold IRA and cryptocurrency investments.\n",

      content: "According to Coin Market Cap, the global crypto market cap is USD$1.88T as of April 2022. Bitcoin still makes up the largest minority of the total, with a market cap of USD$770B (40% of the total).\n\nNeedless to say, Bitcoin is considered the most reliable cryptocurrency at the moment. Be that as it may, other coins can generate considerable profits for investors like yourself. These are what experts call altcoins, which are basically any coin other than Bitcoin.\n\nThe market has generated over 19,000 altcoins since Bitcoin was born. They may not be as widely used as Bitcoin, but altcoins still make up over half of the total crypto market share.\n\nThough some have disappeared before making their mark, the ones that did survive are now becoming more profitable. For example, Ethereum (ETH) takes up a large piece of the cryptocurrency market with a market cap of USD$361B (19%) as of April 2022. In the 2017 altcoin bubble, there were even speculations of ETH overtaking Bitcoin’s dominance - an event that was dubbed “the flippening”.\n\nConsidering the exorbitant gains that were extracted out of the memecoin markets, it's only natural that you'd want to become an altcoin investor.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that an altcoin strategy will be different from a Bitcoin strategy: With\nlow-cap altcoins, a multi-year hodl strategy probably will not be profitable.\n\nHere are four tips to help you get a head start as an altcoin investor.\n\n\n  \n    Know your altcoin niche\n\n    Though the term \"altcoin\" includes the entirety of cryptocurrency coins outside of the famous Bitcoin, several classifications exist within this category. Examples of these are:\n\n    Stablecoins\n\n    A stablecoin is a type of altcoin that is pegged to a non-crypto asset to keep its price stable, hence the name. Stablecoins tie their value to specific goods, like fiat currencies (e.g., US dollars, British pounds) or precious metals. Examples of stablecoins are USD Coin (USDC) and Tether (USDT).\n\n    The primary merit of purchasing and holding stablecoins is the option to stake them on DeFi platforms or lock them in earning plans for good interest on some exchanges. Phemex pays out 11% APY on USDT as of May 2022.\n\n    Meme coins\n\n    A meme coin is basically an altcoin that came into existence due to a popular joke or meme. For example, Dogecoin is a popular meme coin that originated from the Doge meme that was extremely popular at the time of its founding. As unbelievable as it may be, Dogecoin is currently doing well in the crypto market, with a market cap of over $18B.\n\n    Shiba Inu and similar types of altcoins thrive on hype from popular memes, and they most definitely have the potential to blow up. However, a meme coin is just as likely to lose popularity and die down as time progresses.\n\n    Pre-mined altcoins\n\n    Pre-mined altcoins are coins mined before their public launch, which are then distributed to specific individuals. These include founders, investors, and developers of the coin.\n\n    Apart from the lower profitability, pre-mined altcoins are infamous for having their price controlled by the founding team. One of the people behind Ripple (XRP), for example, allegedly sold a huge amount of their coins. This action then caused XRP to plummet in price.\n\n    Utility tokens, privacy tokens, security tokens…\n\n    There are many other classifications of altcoins, such as utility tokens, security tokens, or privacy currencies. Each niche has its own merits.\n\n    Examples of established altcoins that are worth looking into in 2022 include Cardano (ADA) for it’s staking rewards, Binance Coin (BNB) for the platforms that run on it, and Monero (XMR) for its unique privacy features.\n  \n  \n    Select a reliable exchange with altcoin markets\n\n    Despite the ever-increasing popularity of cryptocurrency, not all exchanges are suitable for altcoin investments. Some have relatively high fees (such as Coinbase), while others offer too few altcoin options (such as Kine).\n\n    Since you intend to invest mainly in altcoins, you must look for exchanges with excellent terms and numerous altcoin options. Selecting an exchange is one of the first steps to becoming a successful altcoin investor.\n\n    A general rule of thumb when selecting a crypto exchange is to stick to reputable exchanges and avoid lesser-known platforms. If you want to compare exchanges, you can check Smart Billions and similar sites.\n  \n  \n    Decide on a percentage of portfolio allocation for each altcoin investment\n\n    Once you have specific altcoins in mind, you must decide how much of your portfolio to dedicate to each altcoin. In an interview with billionaire Mark Cuban, he states that his cryptocurrency holdings consist of 60% Bitcoin, 30% Ethereum, and 10% lower-cap altcoins.\n\n    With this practice, you can avoid scenarios where you lose all your funds by investing too much in one altcoin. This is especially true if you plan on investing on risky altcoins with highly volatile prices.\n\n    In your case, you'd want to decide on the allocation for each altcoin. For instance, you can divvy it up, so 50% is spent on Altcoin A, 30% on Altcoin B, and 20% on other altcoins.\n  \n  \n    Take the market cap of the altcoin into consideration\n\n    Most investors focus on an asset's price when investing in a coin. It may not be a terrible strategy, but it's not a good one either. The price is just one of the factors that determine a crypto coins' value and potential. Rather than focusing solely on a coin's price, you must also look at its market cap. This refers to the total dollar value of all the coins mined (Price X Circulating Supply).\n\n    Investors look at the market cap mainly because it indicates the stability of a coin. Generally speaking, a large cap (over USD$10B) means even when numerous people cash out, the price won't change drastically.\n\n    On the contrary, if an altcoin has a small cap (less than USD$1B), it's susceptible to drastic swings in price. Of course, that's not to say small-cap altcoins are not worth your money. While a volatile altcoin is not necessarily a bad investment, it does affect your strategy. That's why it's important to consider market cap when investing. Remember, a large cap is a good indicator of stability.\n  \n\n\nParting words\n\nAltcoins may technically run on the same mechanisms as Bitcoin, but the investment strategy differs.\n\nTherefore, you may want to look into as many guides as you can for altcoin investing. Who knows, you may find this venture more profitable, especially since altcoins are generally more volatile than Bitcoin.\n",

      title: "Hiring A Crypto Advisor: Is it worth it?",
      content: "Managing your crypto investments is something you might be already doing on your own. Some people even assume that hiring a crypto advisor is unnecessary and is only an added expense. The truth is that it depends. It may be far from true.\n\nThis article will discuss how hiring a crypto consultant can be one of the best ways to manage your investments and can set yourself up for a potentially better financial future. This is true especially in times when you want to focus on other areas of business or of life in general.\n\nWith that in mind, here are some of the advantages of hiring a crypto expert as well as its disadvantages.\n\nPros of working with a crypto advisor\n\n\n  \n    Expert Advice\n\n    One obvious benefit of using the services of a crypto advisor is that they can give you expert advice. This is especially important if you don't know much about cryptocurrency, or if you don’t know a lot about a certain area of crypto investing such as DeFi staking or NFT trading.\n\n    Crypto experts make a career of customizing and managing different kinds of digital assets to meet your risk appetite and focus.\n  \n  \n    Assistance In Diversifying Your Portfolio\n\n    One of the most important benefits of hiring a crypto advisor is portfolio diversification. Diversifying your portfolio allows you to hedge against risk and earn better returns over time.\n\n    However, it is extremely time consuming to go through all the cryptoassets available out there to decide in which to invest.\n\n    A cryptocurrency expert can help you determine the right level of diversification for your portfolio and help you reach your investment goals.\n  \n  \n    Relevant Strategic Information\n\n    Another advantage of having a crypto consultant on your side is that he will keep you informed about changes in your investment assets, especially when there's a problem.\n\n    Part of the job of any financial advisor is to continually analyze the current status of their client's assets and develop strategies to help them achieve their goals.\n\n    A good advisor should provide you with suggestions based on strategies and tactics that will be clearly explained to you. They also should keep in touch with you throughout the process.\n  \n  \n    Professional Monitoring Of Digital Assets\n\n    Another noteworthy benefit is that you get a fresh pair of eyes of someone you can professionally trust.\n\n    One of the challenges that many investors have is controlling their emotions, which can happen even to veteran crypto investors.\n\n    By giving the trust to a professional consultant, you limit the possibility of selling your crypto assets hastily once the market fluctuates. And they can prevent you from making other mistakes that you might regret later on.\n  \n\n\nWhat you’re missing when not working with a crypto advisor\n\n\n  \n    No One To Give You Professional Advice\n\n    If you don't hire a crypto advisor, no one will give you expert advice.\n\n    Most regular people don't know anything about cryptocurrency or how to get started with this new venture. But even experienced investors often do not have enough hours in the day to collect all the information in order to make a decision.\n  \n  \n    You Won't Be Able To Enjoy Some Peace Of Mind\n\n    Diving into cryptocurrency requires an amount of dedication that is proportionate to the potential returns.\n\n    Not having an experienced crypto advisor on your side can make you constantly stressed out, especially if you don't know much about the area of the crypto industry that you are venturing into.\n\n    If you want peace of mind with your crypto assets, hiring an expert to consult your investments can help.\n  \n  \n    If you’re not a strategist, then you’ll probably lack a clear plan\n\n    An advisor's ability to communicate is essential to building strong client relationships.\n\n    Clients often value focused conversations that address their goals and priorities, as opposed to general tactics that may be too technical for them. A good advisor should be able to convey to the prospect that they are on the same page and can help them achieve their goals.\n  \n\n\nWhat you should know before you hire a consultant\n\nLook for someone who is legally bound to put their client's interests before their own. If you can find someone who is fee-only (i.e., you pay for their services directly) instead of commission-based, the pricing structure becomes more transparent. On the other hand, since they do not make money via a commission, your profitability is not necessarily their motivation.\n\nFurthermore, you can choose a crypto consultant who is part of a well-respected financial firm or who has a team behind them. It doesn’t have to be a big legacy finance corporation, in fact businesses native to the crypto community tend to understand the industry better. The crucial aspect is reputation, much like with smaller-scale service providers such as bounty managers.\n\nAnd although cryptocurrencies are still on the cusp of regulation, it's a bonus when you get an advisor who's also a certified public accountant or has extensive knowledge in the taxation of your region. In this way, they can help you stay on top of what is the most cost-effective way of holding or trading crypto in terms of taxes.\n\nLast but not least, if you hire a crypto advisor, you should expect prompt responses and clear communication. However, it's worth asking if you can expect them to respond promptly to your messages. If not, you may want to find someone else. A good consultant is probably very busy, but you should be able to expect a prompt response from them.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe bottom line is that it's always up to you whether or not you should hire a crypto advisor.\n\nIf you do, gather as much information as you can about the person or company by checking out their website, their social media pages, and reviews from crypto or finance outlets.\n",

      title: "Buying Crypto Non-KYC: Where to do it with minimal risk?",
      content: "No-KYC exchanges: Top of the market in 2022\n\n\n  \n    \n      Non-custodial\n      \n        LocalCryptos\n        \n        zero-knowledge dApp (big cryptos only)\n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Custodial\n      \n        Bitforex\n        \n        Quick to list new coins\n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n \n\nThere is always the one exchange that gets the most attention…until a better one emerges. LocalCryptos have been on the top of the market for P2P no-KYC trading for at least 3 years now, but it is probably not going to change any time soon.\n\nWe’ve added Kine DEX into the list of trading no-KYC platforms and added LocalMonero as a P2P marketplace where you can buy for fiat.\n\n\n  Jump to the full list of platforms to buy or trade crypto no-KYC.\n\n\n\n\nBuying crypto without KYC: Know your risks\n\nBack in the infancy of crypto trading, buying Bitcoin without KYC was the standard. Those days are gone, for better or worse.\n\nKYC, or know your customer is now required by all big exchanges as per the ever tightening regulatory requirements.\n\nThe positive impact of KYC is that crypto purchases and withdrawal addresses are getting more documented as each day passes, which makes it far more difficult to use cryptocurrencies for illicit activities.\n\nThe negative is that make you effectively cut off from purchasing crypto just because a big exchange decided to block out traders from country on political or other discretionary reasons, not for reasons of criminal activity.\n\nHot takes asides, in all honestly for many traders long-form KYC questionnaires are just a superfluous evil they don’t want to spend time on.\n\nFor yet others, uploading your documents into a cryptocurrency exchange looks like a surefire way to get them abused and sold on the dark web. (This last group has been around the block, I can tell you.)\n\nWhat to look for in a no-KYC exchange?\n\nBuying crypto non-KYC is by far not without risks, though.\n\nWhile you are not risking fraud by an exchange employee and you are not risking the exposure of your documents through a breach, like it infamously happened to Ledger, buying crypto non-KYC exposes you to the dangers of malicious P2P vendor or to a full-blown exit scam, where the whole no-KYC unregulated exchange vanishes with all user deposits.\n\nBelow are the three most important things to look for in a platform that claims to let you buy or trade crypto without KYC.\n\n1. Non-KYC Crypto Exchange Should Be Non-Custodial\n\nThis is not 2011. Good part of the world knows what crypto is and that crypto exchanges exist - including the law enforcement. KYC requirements exist to prevent people from cashing out their criminal profits.\n\nThat makes sense. What makes arguably less sense is the other reason for KYC, which is to prevent people trading derivatives when an arbitrary financial authority decided that plebs shouldn’t do that. Anyway.\n\nCustodial no-KYC exchanges such as formerly BitMEX are the most obvious platforms to target for hackers and for the law alike.\n\nYour geolocation can be traced on custodial or non-custodial crypto exchanges the same, because of metadata like your IP, reused email address or reused username. The important difference however is that your crypto assets can only be seized from a custodial exchange, if you have it deposited there.\n\nNon-custodial trading happens between two user wallets, ideally with an intermediary which is a smart contract that serves as an escrow. Even the Bitcoin blockchain has enough scripting capability to run a native escrow, by the way.\n\n\n  To trade custodial, you need to send your cryptocurrency to a wallet controlled by the exchange, giving up the control over your asset. (Non-custodial trading is done from a wallet only you control.)\n  To cash out custodial, you need to link your exchange to a bank account, which links your crypto to your IRL identity. (In non-custodial exchanges you need to let your counter-party know your bank account number, but good non-custodial platforms like LocalCryptos encrypt private communication, keeping your fiat-based identity secret.)\n\n\nEven if you sign up on a custodial crypto exchange that boasts to not require KYC, there is no guarantee this will not change in the future and without any warning. We all know what happened to BitMEX, and frankly BitMEX made it last for way longer that seemed likely.\n\nA small, under-the-radar custodial trading platform will be ignored by the authorities for a long time, but at some point it will get popular. Then it will inevitably have to start requiring KYC.\n\nSome custodial exchanges aren’t very nice about it. Some crypto traders report the so-called “KYC Scam”, where crypto trading platforms like Bittrex, Poloniex or Changelly freeze withdrawal function to force users to submit KYC or else lose their deposit.\n\nYou probably get by now that using non-custodial platforms saves a lot of hassle. At this stage, non-custodial trading is not new either - cold staking and yield farming is almost exclusively done on non-custodial platforms, when you leave out Binance staking.\n\n\n\nThe selection of no-KYC markets good for buying is finally getting good enough too:\n\n\n  LocalCryptos is a zero-knowledge P2P market to buy or sell crypto for fiat. Zero-knowledge means that the company running the platform doesn’t have access to any user information - including the private messages between buyers and sellers.  LocalCryptos supports all the oldest cryptos: BTC, ETH, LTC and DASH. These four coins are listed on most other crypto exchanges, where you can then trade them for low-cap cryptos or for restrictive coins like BNB\n  LocalMonero is a P2P platform where you can buy Monero without KYC. It is not a zero-knowledge dApp, it is basically just a message board, which is not ideal - but the XMR blockchain doesn’t support anything better than this. Traders report that LocalMonero vendors usually do not want to see your ID.\n  To trade and DeFi-stake altcoins on a non-custodial exchange, we have Uniswap or Kine DEX or aggregators like 1inch.\n  Futures and leveraged derivatives markets are being developed at LeverJ by community veteran crypto traders.\n  To trade crypto coins and tokens of different blockchains, without giving away custody of your assets, we have WhalesHeaven.\n\n\nNote - LocalBitcoins platform is not recommended - more here\n\nSo there’s that. For buying crypto for fiat with no-KYC, do go non-custodial. As for trading, there’s plenty of DEX platforms to choose from too.\n\nThere are situations where you must trade custodial. It could be that you are a trader who works on short timeframes and you need the liquidity and market depth. If that is so, keep reading through the two following points.\n\n2. Cheap and Easy Crypto Withdrawals\n\nOne of the warning signs of BitMEX being in trouble could have been the prohibitively high fees for crypto withdrawals (up to 10x the transaction fee for BTC). When a crypto exchange does something that discourages traders from withdrawing their money, you know the platform is in trouble.\n\nIn a good no-KYC exchange that is custodial, there should be a high upper cap on crypto withdrawals for no-KYC users. Exchanges might pull a story about mitigating abuse by criminals. This is nonsense, on public blockchains all transactions are traceable. Capping withdrawals makes no sense.\n\nHigh withdrawal maxes\n\n\n  Bitfinex (6% off fees) has no maximum withdrawal limit for no-KYC traders. - This is great\n  Bitforex has a limit of max 100 BTC per 24 hours for no-KYC traders, with 10k+ USD withdrawals delaying a few hours for additional checks. - This is pretty good\n\n\nLow withdrawal minimums and fees\n\nA no-KYC crypto exchange will never announce they got hacked or seized before touching user withdrawals. Withdrawals will go first, only after some time will the users learn what actually happened and whether they have a chance of getting their crypto back. A 2020 showcase of the issue was the Chinese futures exchange OKEx, when it halted withdrawals due to trouble with the police.\n\nYou can avoid getting caught up in this type of mess by withdrawing your money to a crypto wallet often enough, for which you need the exchange to have low withdrawal fees and low withdrawal minimums.\n\n\n  Bitfinex (6% off fees) withdrawal minimum is “0.00012 BTC” (variable - 5 USD equivalent) with fee 0.0004 BTC for Bitcoin\n  Bitforex withdrawal minimum is 0.0010 BTC with fee 0.0005 BTC\n  Phemex withdrawal minimum is 0.0.0010 BTC with fee 0.00057 BTC\n\n\nEasy withdrawals are paramount in custodial non-KYC exchanges as these are most likely to get in trouble at some point.\n\nNow to re-iterate the previous key point: With regards to fully custody-free DEX platforms like WhalesHeaven, you wouldn’t need to worry about a hack, nor about exit scam or too high withdrawal fees. The type of tech they’re using doesn’t allow them to have custody of your assets at all.\n\nThat means that having your funds stolen through a non-custodial platform wouldn’t be possible - you’re in control of your funds at all times. It also means they aren’t be able to impose withdrawal fees on you, because you are trading from your own wallet.\n\nAs for buying crypto for fiat on a non-custodial exchange, the place for that is LocalCryptos. Unlike LocalBitcoins, LocalCryptos is actually a dApp. That means the exchange knows no details about its vendors and buyers.\n\nA somewhat similar outfit in terms of p2p architecture is the Crypton Exchange, but Crypton is built for trading more so than for simple purchases like LocalCryptos.\n\nCrypton is part of the full-fledged Utopia ecosystem together with web browser, emails and chat system, and is a kind of non-KYC “digital offshore” platform of a new generation. The process of registration on the exchange is absolutely anonymous: you only need a nickname and password. Crypton claims all transaction data is protected and cannot be transferred to third parties.\n\n3. Proven Track Of Record, Exchange Reps on Reddit\n\nA custodial exchange needs to have easily accessible customer support.\n\nPrivate Telegram chats and 1-on-1 customer service is usually reserved for fully verified OTC traders, but everyone should be able to quickly reach out to an exchange representative on Reddit when they notice a problem with the platform.\n\nGood track of record is important too - and not just a record of past without hacking.\n\nBitfinex was hacked in August 2016 but they handled the situation well by being upfront about it. They promptly organized AMA sessions with the community head and eventually came up with the redemption token scheme which made up for the losses individual users had to take - even for the losses of unverified users. (Note that legacy solutions offer no help for non-KYC users.)\n\nGood handling of the incident leaves Bitfinex with a great track of records even though they were hacked, and a recommended non-KYC custodial exchange.\n\nEither way, there is clearly a lot of demand for non-KYC crypto trading, because new platforms keep emerging every so often. One example is Bitforex, that only emerged very recently but became the mecca of non-KYC dog money trading.\n\n\n\nList of best no-KYC crypto exchanges\n\n\n  (Custodial) Bitfinex: spot, margin, lending, futures, airdrops\n    \n      Bitfinex also owns a non-custodial trading platform DeversiFi with no gas fees\n      Long and decent track of record\n    \n  \n  (Custodial) Bitforex: perps, small alts, up to 200x leverage\n    \n      No US resident policy (more about Bitforex in the review here)\n      Has perpetual swap, airdrops, NFT and Metaverse coins… anything that gets hyped\n      Short but so far good track of record\n    \n  \n  (Custodial) Phemex: perps, spot, tether, bonuses and competitions\n    \n      has limits (more about Phemex in the review here)\n    \n  \n  (Custodial) WhiteBit: defi, staking, futures, airdrops\n    \n      has limits\n    \n  \n  (P2P) Crypton Exchange: anonymous signup, runs on the Utopia p2p ecosystem\n  (P2P) LocalMonero: onramp from fiat into XMR\n  (Non-Custodial) LocalCryptos: onramp (p2p, zero-knowledge dApp) This platform is recommended for buying crypto for fiat without KYC\n  (Non-Custodial) LeverJ: futures trading and tokenized legacy assets\n  (Non-Custodial) Uniswap: spot trading and liquidity staking (high gas fees)\n  (Non-Custodial) DeversiFi: ETH-based DeFi DEX (zero gas fees)\n  (Non-Custodial) WhalesHeaven: decentralized p2p swap (escrow, zero withdrawal fees, lowest trading/transaction fees possible)\n  (Non-Custodial) Swapzone: aggregates exchanges, crypto to crypto swap, compares best exchange rates\n  (Non-Custodial) Kine: DEX run by former Huobi execs, trades popular coins like SHIB or ETH in stablecoin pairs. Very low fees!\n  (Non-Custodial) Droidex: best exchange rates across most popular DEX, minimal gas fee, compares best exchange rates, crypto to crypto swap, easy-to-use interface\n\n\nWord of caution: WhalesHeaven is a new p2p platform that does not have nearly as good cred in the community as LocalCryptos do.\n",

      title: "Crypto Arbitrage Bots - How to make arbitrage worth it in 2022",
      content: "In this article:\n\n  The safest crypto arbitrage is the two-country model\n  Arbitrage on big crypto markets is not worth it\n  Two crypto arbitrage types profitable in 2022\n    \n      Small altcoin arbitrage: Why it works, Tools, Best Arb Bots\n      Spot-futures arbitrage: Why it works, Tools, Best Arb Bots\n    \n  \n\n\nCrypto arbitrage bots seem to be the crypto trading flavour of the week.\n\nFor better or worse, arbitrage trading (crypto or other) stops working when everyone starts doing it because the market prices on a free market change with trading activity.\n\n\n\nTwo-country Setup is Forever The Best Crypto Arbitrage\n\nOne of the implications of that is for instance that the safest crypto arbitrage will always be the two-country set up: Countries like South Korea or Japan live a bit secluded from the US &amp; EU trading, and so the fiat value of crypto markets tends to trail farther off the US &amp; EU dominated international markets.\n\nIn South Korean markets, restrictive capital policies have made the markets especially prone to price discrepancies. In the press you will often see this referred to as the “Kimchi premium”.\n\nWhy is the two-country arbitrage the safest? Because it’s so hard to get into.\n\nYou need to have some sort of presence in two countries - such as, being native to EU but a permanent resident to South Korea for instance. Otherwise Korean exchanges won’t let you open an account or won’t let you withdraw fiat money.\n\nThat means that the vast majority of people who notice this arbitrage opportunity will not be able to trade on it. That in turn means the markets will not manage to close the price gap, because there’s not enough people trading that gap.\n\n\n\nCrypto arbitrage on big international markets is not worth it\n\nThe two-country set up is not the only type of arbitrage that’s out there.\n\nPlain arbitrage would have you trade the same market on two different exchanges.\n\nThen you can also do triangular arbitrage, which is where you take advantage of three different currencies - such as BTC/USDT on Binance, ETH/BTC on Kraken and BTC/ETH on Bitfinex.\n\n\n  Example triangular arbitrage: With Bitfinex you’re able to trade BTC for ETH, on Kraken you can trade ETH for USDT and then finally on Binance you can trade USDT for BTC. If the price of each currency moves just right, you can end up making a small profit from the entire transaction.\n\n\nBut both plain and triangular arbitrage are reasonably considered more risky than the two-country arbitrage, because you’re dealing with currencies on internationally open markets.\n\nInternationally open markets get traded (by people and bots) in large volumes, which quickly erases arbitrage opportunities on most big markets like BTCUSD or ETHUSD.\n\nWith the price gap that gets smaller and smaller with time, you need to be able to move more and more money to get a fee discount for volume and a decent profit in.\n\nAnd then, since this is crypto, consider that unregulated custodial exchanges themselves may run arbitrage bots and trade with customer deposits. In legacy markets this would not fly but in crypto there is nothing preventing that.\n\n\n\nHow to choose a crypto arbitrage bot that will still earn in 2022\n\nThe only avenue where crypto arbitrage bots can still earn you good money is in small altcoins, and in spot-futures arbitrage - either through the so-called “cash&amp;carry” arbitrage, which pays out when the futures contract expires, or through arbitrage of a crypto perpetual swap, which pays out several times a day when the funding rate changes.\n\nLet’s now quickly explain why these two arbs work, and add a list of the best crypto arbitrage bots and other useful arbitrage trading tools for both small altcoin arbitrage traders and for spot-futures arbitrage traders.\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Small altcoin arbitrage (Coinigy , Trade The Chain , Coinrule )\n\n    Why is this arbitrage consistently profitable: Newly launched crypto markets are always prone to insane price fluctuations in their early price action, and those insanities are not necessarily in sync across different exchanges. This gives the opportunity for arbitrage: You can trade the price difference of the same alt coin as it launches trading on several exchanges.\n\n    How to choose the arb bot: Since the arbitrage gap is relatively short-lived, you do actually need a crypto bot to notify you on the opportunity. You would not manage finding the opportunity manually and executing it in time.\n\n    If you want to arb small altcoins, look for an arbitrage bot trained for looking up anomalies on small altcoin markets specifically.\n\n    Best Tools for arbing small altcoins manually\n    \n      (freemium) Coinigy is a freemium crypto charting platform that lets you trade directly through the interface. That makes for a fast enough acting to arbitrage small altcoins manually. Additionally, Coinigy provides the ArbMatrix which is an alert system that notifies Coinigy users on arbitrage opportunities.\n      (paid) Trade The Chain is a dashboard and an AI market signal tracker that will alert you on any new market launches and any abnormal activity on markets. Those are the events you want to act on in arbitrage trading - that is where most of the profit is these days.\n    \n\n    Best Crypto bots to help you execute arbitrage\n    \n      Coinrule Bot - Coinrule has an automated crypto arbitrage bot, but it uses BitMEX exclusively. On other exchanges you won’t get the automated system that looks for opportunities for you, although Coinrule promises more features are coming.\n      3commas Bot does not provide a built-in automation for crypto arbitrage, but the link goes to a really in-depth guide into arbitrage trading that they have in their blog.\n    \n\n    \n  \n  \n    Spot-Futures arbitrage (Pionex )\n\n    Why is this arbitrage consistently profitable: Futures markets offer cheaper leverage than margin trading on spot markets. It is not immediately obvious, but that is basically the reason why futures markets usually have an arbitrage opportunity, even though they are not new markets and they are available internationally without restrictions.\n\n    Cheap leverage means that futures get speculated on by greedy traders who look for future moon, and this particular trading activity often drags the future price above spot. Conversely, in times of fear, traders (but also miners or hodlers) use futures to hedge - by selling. This often drags the price down below spot.\n\n    The eternal cycle of fear and greed on free markets explains how there almost always is some arbitrage opportunity in crypto futures.\n\n    How to choose the arb bot: The crypto spot-futures arbitrage opportunity is good enough to execute the arb manually, because with spot-futures arbitrage you only get paid the day the futures funding rate changes. So, there is no need for trading at scale or acting super fast.\n\n    The drawback is you need to be actually trading full time to notice spot-futures arbitrage opportunities.\n\n    If you’re not a trader but you want to trade spot-futures arbitrage, get a bot. Look specifically for a crypto bot trained for spot-futures arbitrage. The bot will seek the opportunities for you.\n\n    Best Arbitrage Bots for Perps Funding\n    \n      (free) Pionex Arbitrage Bot - Pionex is a new Asian exchange that has more than 10 different crypto trading bots available right on the exchange. One of them is the spot-futures arbitrage bot that will automate the whole perpetual futures arbitrage process for you. The image below shows what it looks like - you just need to deposit and click a button.\n    \n\n    \n  \n\n\nBottom line\n\nTL;DR: unless you are a high frequency trader with access to proprietary software, you will not find many arbitrage opportunities in big crypto markets worth your time. If you still want to do it, niche down and look for a bot that’s been trained specifically for the task.\n\nYour best crypto arbitrage opportunities right now are arbing very small altcoins and arbing the perpetual swap funding rate. The perps arb can be automated.\n",

      title: "[Checklist] Incorporating Blockchain Technologies Into Your Business",
      content: "Companies of all sizes and niches are making the jump and start accepting crypto payments or using tools like NFTs for marketing and promo. It seems it’s only a matter of time before blockchain becomes one of the standard platforms for doing business.\n\nIt’s true that with the rise of blockchain consultancies, it’s never been easier to get started.\n\n\n  There’s a checklist at the end of the article for those of you who are considering that.\n\n\nOtherwise, this article will give you some creative ideas on how and why to start working with blockchain. There are many ways to incorporate blockchain technology into businesses, and it can benefit in more ways than one.\n\nBlockchain in business: The Basics\n\nBlockchain technology is used as the base of most cryptocurrencies, as it provides a secure and permanent record of transactions and changes. Blockchain holds all data without the possibility of third-party interference and allows transaction tracing, if you document your movement well.\n\nAnd then, unlike a database system, blockchain is immutable. As explained on Investopedia, this means that all data entry is irreversible.\n\nSo, if you create an NFT of a legal contract, you are sure to have the exact and untampered document no matter through how many hands it has passed before it reached you.\n\nWhy Incorporate Blockchain Technology?\n\nRight now, adopting blockchain technology means most of all a great way to network and get new opportunities for your business.\n\nFor large corporates, the value is in forming closer partnerships: Using blockchain, businesses can communicate and work with one another through shared blockchain data.\n\nFor B2C companies, it allows companies to accept a wider range of payments. Companies able to accept cryptocurrency as a payment method can potentially expand their customer demographic. With the easing in regulations for businesses in some countries, the barriers to entry are lowering as you might not even need a license to run a crypto company.\n\nLastly, the transparency of blockchain records is also quite appealing to many businesses. Having access to an irreversible record of transactions will allow them to better account for business expenses and view their transaction histories. Companies also have better opportunities to monitor their records under one roof which can aid with business optimisation.\n\nBut even more importantly, blockchain technology provides the tools for businesses to automate a good part of their accounting and administrative activities via smart contracts.\n\nSmart Contracts for automation and cost cutting\n\nSmart contracts are digital records of a transaction stored on a blockchain ledger.\n\nBlockchain technology allows smart contracts to be written and settled directly on the blockchain and will go into effect immediately as long as the preset conditions are satisfied.\n\nThis is one way in which blockchain technology cuts out third-party interference and creates a more direct and transparent way of executing business. Not to mention that automating administrative tasks cuts your expenses in the long run.\n\nBlockchain business specialists like GlowLabs make it easy for businesses to get started integrating blockchain technology into their daily practices. They focus on expanding revenue and growing businesses in digital spaces.\n\nAs all business consultants, blockchain consultants will also help identify a target market and will help with choosing the best hardware and software tools based on your company’s needs. That will make sure that your company is getting the best of blockchain technology can provide to it.\n\n\n\nChecklist: Incorporate blockchain technology into your business\n\nThis is a useful checklist to go through if you’re considering integrating blockchain technology into your business, but are not quite sure about any specifics. This checklist will help you get a clearer picture before you hire a blockchain business consultant.\n\n\n  \n    The first step in incorporating blockchain technology into a business is to identify the need for it. Ask yourself, what will this bring to your business, or how will it help a company reach its goals?\n  \n  \n    There are a few ways to begin incorporating blockchain technology into a business. What is the way in which you want to integrate blockchain? As mentioned earlier, as little as getting a crypto wallet will allow companies to accept cryptocurrency as a payment method. The set up gets much more technical with smart contracts.\n  \n  \n    What are some of the technical uses of blockchain you are not sure if you can use? For example, blockchain also allows for increased digital storage. According to Entrepreneur, businesses and individuals spend over $20 billion annually on cloud storage. Blockchain technology can offer a secure storage for a much cheaper price.\n  \n  \n    Consider some of the less obvious ways. For one, if your business has a loyal audience, a good opportunity may be to incorporate blockchain technology by releasing NFT collectibles, where NFT stands for non-fungible tokens. Releasing NFTs is a marketing strategy beneficial to both parties and primarily aims to increase capital for businesses.\n  \n\n\nFinal Words on Blockchain Technology Integration\n\nThrough blockchain technology, businesses can function in a more cost-efficient manner and create a direct connection with their clients or with one another.\n\nWith blockchain’s wide range of tools and uses, it is a viable option for businesses of any size: There’s payments, automation, data storage and plain promo.\n\nBlockchain technology can seem intimidating and complicated, but it doesn’t have to be. Small, simple steps of integration make it possible to incorporate blockchain technology without drastically changing the day-to-day functioning of your business.\n",

      title: "Moving Averages: List of best MAs by purpose (+ TradingView strategies)",
      content: "Moving average is one of the technical indicators that is almost a household name. Everybody who has ever seen a market chart knows that moving averages exist. Some exchanges even print them on their charts by default.\n\nWhen the same technical indicator gets used by everyone, it can be a good thing: The fact that most traders act on the indicator contributes to the fact that it works. On the other hand, it can also lead to people trying to front-run one another.\n\nLuckily, MA, or moving average, is a very modular indicator that exists in many variations of it. Using a variant of MA is usually a good idea if you do it with a specific purpose in mind. Algo developers also use MAs as a part of their strategy - that is, not relying only on them, but still working with them.\n\nIn this post we’ll look at some moving average variants that you can get free of charge on Cryptowatch and Tradingview, and also at what you can do with them.\n\nContents:\n\n\n  What can MAs do for you?\n  List of Moving Average variations\n    \n      SMA, EMA, WMA, TMA, Hull and ALMA.\n      Interesting TradingView strategies and scripts linked.\n    \n  \n  Moving Average settings in crypto\n\n\n\n\nWhat does moving average do for you as a trader?\n\n\n  Moving average is the rolling average price over the past X periods.\n  On a 1D chart, the MA(20) will be the average value of the price over the past 20 days.\n\n\nThe purpose of any kind of the moving average is trend analysis - to smooth out price action to bring up the trend.\n\nMarkets are volatile, on the daily they fake-out, overshoot or start a panic only to return back to where that started in a few hours.\n\nMoving average takes this short-term volatility out of the picture and lets you focus on the longer trend instead. That way an MA gives a trader a clear view of what has happened, and consequently also what might likely come next.\n\n\n  To illustrate the purpose of MAs better: You could also do the opposite and detrend your charts to remove the trend and only see the daily back-and-forth volatility. That can also be traded - we have volatility contracts, different types of grid trading and also scalping.\n\n\nWhy do algo traders use moving averages?\n\nMoving averages form one of the building blocks in most serious automated trading strategies as an indicator of overall direction of the market.\n\nA trading bot algorithm needs that general, big-picture information to be able to decide which direction you want to trade - up or down - and which trend we are in at current moment.\n\nThis is the information that algo traders use MA for: “Is it the time to look for a long entry or for a short entry?” The entry point itself is not determined yet, only the direction.\n\nMoving average is one of the tools that give us this insight.\n\nIs it the best one? In my opinion not.\n\nBut even indicators like Bollinger Bands are variants of a moving average - and bbands do work pretty well.\n\n\n\nModifications and variations of MA\n\n\n  \n    SMA - simple moving average\n\n    The simple or standard moving average is the basic moving average. It gives you the plain average of prices over X periods.\n\n    Traders use SMA for trend analysis, and at that usually by looking at the crossover of a fast one and a slow one. The SMA cross of 50 and 200 is the garden variety technical analysis that you will get on mainstream television.\n\n    In algo trading, it can be useful as a double-check that your algo is perceiving the trend right. While TMA or EMA may be better for that, SMA is simple enough to be available even on simple drag-and-drop bot trading platforms like Coinrule.\n\n    Interesting TradingView script: Regression channel made out of SMA, EMA and ALMA. It does something similar to Bollinger bands, except it plots the linear regression - the flat channel instead of the curvy bbands. Author recommends it for trend checking, it might be good as a base for automated grid trading on ranging markets too.\n\n    \n  \n  \n    EMA - Exponential Moving Average\n\n    EMA is like SMA except it gives more weight to the more recent data points of price action.\n\n    That adjustment somewhat fixes the classic property of SMA, which is that it takes a long time until the moving average registers even quite sharp turns in price action.\n\n    The use is otherwise the same as with SMA.\n\n    Interesting TradingView script: Kahlman HullMA / WT Cross Strategy A strategy that uses exponential and Hull moving averages to work out the crossovers. The entries/exits are marked on the chart.\n\n    \n  \n  \n    WMA - Weighted Moving Average\n\n    WMA runs on a similar idea as EMA. You can think of it as a younger sibling of EMA - the only difference is that WMA uses different weighting factors for the more recent price points (which makes it even more sensitive to changes in price than EMA).\n\n    That makes WMA pick up changes in trend faster than SMA or EMA, but will also retain more of the volatility noise. That means it is better suited for short term trades, not that much for trend analysis.\n\n    Interesting TradingView script: DayTradingFutures Cross-Strategy with WMA and a built-in helper to show you where to set your stops. The default way is based on average true range.\n\n    \n  \n  \n    T3 or TMA - Triangular Moving Average\n\n    TMA stands for triangular MA. Triangular moving average makes an average of SMA points over the time span, which makes it way looser and smoother.\n\n    TMA is your trend analysis tool: It is loose and catches really only the trend. TMA will tell you nothing in ranging markets that move back and forth.\n\n    Interesting TradingView script: Triangular Moving Average (TMA) bands are like Bollinger bands, except they are made with TMA and therefore looser. If you use bands for scalping, using looser ones in certain markets will mean you will take more profits. You’ll have to backtest though.\n\n    \n  \n  \n    ALMA - Arnaud-Legaux moving average\n\n    ALMA is a technical indicator based on Arnaud Legaux’s paper “Adapting Moving Averages to Market Changes”.\n\n    As a consequence, ALMA provides almost twice as many trading signals in comparison with SMA. Basically, it is much faster and sticks much closer to the price action.\n\n    This makes ALMA a good MA to get your stop loss position, if you want to keep your stops tight and your risk small.\n\n    The downside of the same property is that ALMA will give you a lot of false signals, because it just moves too fast. This will show especially if you try to do crossovers.\n\n    Interesting TradingView script: MA ribbon for traders who decide well based on visual intuition. This indicator prints a series of MAs in a ribbon. The ribbon is used for trend analysis - looking at the balance and distances of the ribbons determines the strength of the trend.\n\n    \n  \n  \n    HMA - Hull Moving Average\n\n    HMA is a very interesting one. It is a WMA modified in a nonlinear way. HMA puts even more emphasis on recent price data than WMA. The idea is that HMA has got its own momentum, which makes it different from other moving averages.\n\n    But on top of that, the smoothing is improved as well. It takes in more data points than just the latest price average.\n\n    The result is an MA that is fast in trailing the price, but it is smooth enough to not pick up the noise of the short term volatility.\n\n    Thanks to the smoothing, Hull MA tracks the price closely but doesn’t give too many fake crossovers when you plot two of Hulls.\n\n    This makes Hull MA crosses (confirmed by more TA) good enough for entry and exit signals in forex and in your crypto scalping.\n\n    Interesting TradingView script: Double Hull MA v2\n\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nMoving averages timeframes and settings\n\n\n  In crypto\n\n\nShould you go for specific MA settings for crypto?\n\nThis is the same issue as with ichimoku settings for crypto.\n\nSome traders set all their crypto indicators to spans of 28 or 30 instead of 20 or 21. This is done because crypto trades every day, whereas stocks do not - and stocks are where the convention of 20 or 21 comes from.\n\nI do think this works better. It is then ~28-30 spans to represent a month and ~60 spans to represent two months (with some leeway).\n\nSome traders like to shorten the months a bit, because volume is low at the weekends. Ultimately, test it. I adjust my settings based on the strength of the market too.\n\n\n  In general\n\n\nThe fast-moving MA variations are popular among traders who trade intraday.\n\nEven if you are a daytrader though, it is still a good practice to check longer time-frames. What you are looking to see is if the odds are generally in the favour of your direction these days or if you are about to make a contrarian trade.\n\nChecking the “macro” mood is especially important if you are setting up an automated strategy.\n\nWhen we trade manually, we often take into account information we don’t even realise we are seeing. It is a gut level thing because we have done it so many times that it doesn’t even have to register consciously.\n\nBut a trading bot does not have human judgement, it just executes. That’s why it is important to feed it context information as well.\n",

      title: "3 Tips For Trading Crypto In Australia",
      content: "There is an ever-increasing number of altcoin traders. This industry has become one of the most lucrative sectors, especially during the months leading to and after the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nOf course, the DeFi sector especially was already growing even before the unprecedented events of the year 2020. But you can't deny that the work-from-home system also played a crucial role in the developments of yield farming or NFT trading and gaming. (1)\n\nEven today, new people people keep joining the crypto community. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned trader, it is worth a reminder that the first rule of thumb is that you should always understand the dynamics of the market before you put your money on the line.\n\nYou should also find a trading platform that best fits your needs. There are many websites like Crypto Exchanges Australia that list reputable crypto exchanges that are best known for a given digital coin in various countries across the globe.\n\nThat said, this article discusses all the three newbie tips for trading crypto in Australia. If you're interested to know more, keep on reading!\n\n\n  \n    Find the right trading platform\n\n    The first step towards a great experience as a trader is finding the right trading platform for your trading style. Unfortunately, this is the one thing that many beginners overlook and struggle with in their journey in this field.\n\n    Where you carry out all your trading-related tasks doesn't only determine your overall experience but may also have a significant impact on your success.\n\n    There are many crypto exchanges in Australia today, and many more international exchanges that accept Australian traders. (2)\n\n    That's an advantage, but it also means you're likely to have difficulty deciding on the right candidate. Therefore, you must have a list of factors to consider when deciding on this situation.\n\n    One of the most crucial things to look for is the exchange's licenses. It should be certified and accredited by relevant authorities. If you want to really take all the precautions, the exchange should be based in Australia and offer asset insurance.\n\n    Make sure that the platform you choose is also easy to use. Navigation of the website should be simple, even for beginners. This is crucial because you would want to access all necessary corners during your trading sessions, especially when trying to save time. In addition, it will help make your technical analysis easier.\n\n    Talking of technical factors, any financial analysis reports offered by the platform should be written clearly enough for you to understand. This way, you'll be able to make informed decisions that will impact your success as a trader.\n  \n  \n    Choose the best cryptocurrency for your trading\n\n    All crypto exchanges you'll come across in Australia offer a variety of alt coins to trade, although some have limited options. In fact, this should be one of the factors to consider when choosing the right crypto exchange platform for you—the more cryptocurrencies at your disposal, the higher your chances of success as a trader.\n\n    However, just like crypto exchanges, the more options you have, the more complicated your decision becomes as to which one to trade, especially if you're a beginner.\n\n    So, why does the type of crypto coin matter? First, the value of these currencies determines their affordability. For instance, apart from being the most popular, Bitcoin is currently the most valuable cryptocurrency. Its growth in value also makes it one of the best options for any trader looking to join the mix. Of course, there are other alternative coins, but you'll have to be careful with your choices because their growth hasn't yet matched Bitcoin's. (1)\n\n    As an Australian trader, your options for cryptocurrencies include anything from the big cryptos (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, and Litecoin) to the small low-cap cryptos and DeFi coins. The list is unending, but these are the top-performing coins in the industry. Therefore, make sure you choose a crypto exchange platform with at least one or all three. (3)\n  \n  \n    Learn basic trading skills\n\n    It doesn't matter where you're trading from. The rule of the game is pretty much universal. Thus, before you step into the field, it's recommended that you learn the basic knowledge of trading crypto.\n\n    For a beginner, the ins and outs of this industry can be very intimidating, but the gist is pretty much to know whether you want to buy a crypto for the long run, or whether you will want to sell it in a small profit as soon as possible.\n\n    • The easiest buy-and-hold strategy is called dollar cost averaging and there’s an Aussie exchange that lets you easily automate it.\n\n    • The most popular strategy for short-term trading is called scalping.\n\n    Start your journey with these basic terms and work your way up towards crypto's complex knowledge - it will enhance your understanding.\n\n    The good thing is that once you've gotten the hang of it, the rest of the things will start flowing. Fortunately, there are many informative materials online to learn about trading crypto. Make sure you go through as many relevant articles and videos as possible so that you can be well-prepared for the task ahead.\n  \n\n\nConclusion\n\nTrading crypto isn't for the faint-hearted, but that's not to say you can't do it. If you're from Australia, it's worth noting that many crypto exchanges are designed to make your trading experience as enjoyable as possible. Hence, when choosing the right platform, some of the factors to consider include available crypto coins, ease of trading, and the company's licenses.\n\nIn addition, when trading crypto in Australia, another tip to keep in mind is choosing the right digital coin. Remember, not all coins are profitable. Therefore, your choice here may determine your success in the industry. But before you get this far, you must learn all the basics of crypto trading. This way, you'll be able to understand the fundamentals of the whole system, which should help you make informed decisions.\n\nReferences\n\n(1) - \"The Complete History of Cryptocurrency for Beginners\", Source: https://parameter.io/history-of-cryptocurrency/\n\n(2) - \"Best Crypto Exchanges Australia 2022 – Find A Crypto Trading Platform.\", Source: https://www.business2community.com/au/cryptocurrency/best-crypto-exchanges\n\n(3) - \"Top-Performing Cryptocurrencies For Australian Investors.\", Source: https://www.news.com.au/finance/money/investing/topperforming-cryptocurrencies-for-australian-investors/news-story/b67539603c05ce946373d8b0ac074948\n",

      title: "Crypto Trading Scams: Most common scams in 2022",
      content: "The modern world has emerged with new ways of representing assets and the use of cryptocurrencies is becoming integral to finance. As you know, cryptocurrencies are built on blockchain technology and, as a result, aren't reliant on any government or centralized body.\n\nWhile the decentralized system has its advantages, the fact that it is not regulated brings about certain issues. There has been a surge in the rate of crypto scams.\n\nScammers stole a record USD$14 billion in crypto scams in 2021, according to Chainalysis, a blockchain data firm.\n\nCrypto Scams: An Overview\n\nThe ideology behind cryptocurrencies dictates that cryptos are a better alternative to legacy finance.\n\nThe traditional system is criticized for its data silos, honeypots and dependence on government policies, including diplomatic decisions.\n\nIn the wake of realizing that people's finance shouldn't be at the behest of governments, cryptocurrency emerged as the solution.\n\nWith great power comes great responsibility\n\nAs much as cryptocurrencies ruptured the traditional ways of transferring money, blockchain technology, a distributed public ledger on which the cryptocurrencies are built, has been subject to gross porosity by scammers who've been steadily devising new ways of stealing.\n\nAnd people have fallen victim to crypto scams via many fraud channels.\n\nTwitter is the melting pot for all things crypto\n\n…And that includes crypto scams. Some of these fraudulent activities have been motivated by the increase in people's interest in cryptocurrencies.\n\nInfluencers on social media understandably contributed to this rise, one of which is Elon Musk, the famous business magnate and the CEO of SpaceX.\n\nHe touted Dogecoin as the 'people's coin' in 2021, and the cryptocurrency bulled its way to a 4000% increase in value.\n\nUnfortunately, a wave of influencer endorsement scams ensued.\n\nMost common crypto scams in 2022\n\n\n  \n    Influencer Endorsements\n\n    Scammers use the power of social media and the gullibility of some users to make a bank. They pose as successful business people to influence social media users to invest in a coordinated virtual crypto Ponzi scheme.\n\n    Another common one is to trick people into sending money into a “smart contract” that will send back a larger amount. - These are always scams.\n\n    Sometimes it goes even further than impersonation, though. That happened on the 15th of July, 2020, when a cyber criminal compromised about 130 high-profile Twitter accounts to promote a bitcoin scam.\n\n    Verify the identity of social media influencer accounts before investing in any business with them.\n\n    If they are someone well known, they will have the blue badge next to their user name, like so:\n\n    \n  \n  \n    Phishing\n\n    Phishing has been one of the most frequently used fraud channels, especially since Ledger’s e-mail database got hacked.\n\n    Phishing is a type of cybercrime where prospective victims get contacted by e-mail. Victims receive emails that look like they're an update note from your crypto exchange or crypto wallet.\n\n    These mails have links embedded in them which, if clicked, could result in the scammer obtaining your exchange login or your wallet seed phrase. Once you type in your data into the malicious form, your wallets get drained.\n\n    To avoid this, make sure you:\n\n    \n      Always download your updates directly from the wallet interface (Ledger Live, Trezor Suite, Exodus app) - never ever from an email.\n      Use multi-factor authentication on all exchanges.\n      Use wallet whitelisting on all exchanges.\n    \n  \n  \n    Crypto Investment Scams\n\n    Investment or business opportunity scams are common in crypto. You will find new crypto tokens and investors parading themselves as the new overlord with great potential. They feed on the 'fear of missing out syndrome of crypto investors.\n\n    Since the rise of Bitcoin, millions of investors have been looking for the next big cryptocurrency to invest in and make life-changing money.\n\n    The consequence is that some will invest in tokens that sound too good to be true, only to realize later that they've been scammed.\n\n    Identifying fundamental value of cryptos can help improve your judgement, but practically, the road of risk management tends to have better results in crypto.\n\n    One example from history of crypto: Ethereum started out by sending unsolicited messages to r/bitcoin subscribers and presented itself very much like a typical scam.\n\n    \n      The safe approach would have been to avoid ETH.\n      The risk-aware approach would have you invest only a tiny amount of money into Ethereum’s ICO.\n    \n\n    If you consider your risks before your potential profits, then the riskier the venture sounds, the smaller amount you invest. You may still lose, but the loss will not be devastating.\n  \n  \n    Sham Websites\n\n    The first thing you should consider as a trader is the safety of the assets you deposit into custodial exchanges. A sad amount of crypto trading takes place on websites that are very transparently dodgy.\n\n    \n      Does your new crypto project promise unrealistic returns?\n      Does it project its coins as mooning (rising) when they're not even trading?\n      Is there an 'About Us' page for information about the company on the website?\n      Can you prove the identity of anyone involved in the company?\n    \n\n    If you have unsatisfactory responses to these questions, you should not deposit money into that platform.\n  \n\n\nBottom line\n\nYou can identify and avoid crypto trading scams if you plan to start trading or already are trading crypto.\n\nIt's crucial to be vigilant as a crypto trader because if you fall victim to a crypto trading scam, getting justice in an unregulated industry is a castle-in-the-air dream.\n",

      content: "Few things are being discussed as much as the potential of cryptocurrency at the moment.\n\nIf you are a legacy trader who wants to start trading Bitcoin, you have plenty of options to do so. One of them is to trade crypto on a forex platform.\n\nYou should know what you're going into, though. Read more about trading forex with Bitcoin here.\n\nTrading platforms are responding to popular demand\n\nCrypto trading has quickly become a multi-billion-dollar industry attracting traders all over the world.\n\nSome forex and stock traders don’t want to miss out on that and are expanding their portfolio to include Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as well.\n\nA lot of them are not what the crypto world calls “hodlers” though.\n\nThese traders tend to invest in crypto only to speculate on its rising fiat value in short term.\n\nLegacy traders choose crypto CFDs and crypto fans trade tokenized stocks\n\nThe product of choice for the trader who doesn’t believe in crypto will be either a fintech app like Revolut, if they are beginners, or a platform that offers contracts for difference (CFDs) if they are veteran traders. And that’s even though there are plenty of exchanges to choose from when buying and selling real Bitcoin or alt coins.\n\nThis means that you can now speculate on Bitcoin on forex platforms that offer CFDs. If you want an introduction to this type of trading, you can read much more and find the best platforms on https://www.fxforex.com/.\n\nInterestingly, the exact mirror opposite is happening in cryptocurrency circles. Crypto enthusiasts will dab into legacy markets by trading tokenized stocks on crypto trading platforms like FTX, but they are not likely to buy and hold the actual stock.\n\nThey don’t trust legacy markets, but will speculate on them for the quick profit and glory. That is just the way in which most legacy traders treat crypto.\n\nThe bottom line is, there are plenty of similarities between the two styles of trading which is why they're attracting the same type of traders. Individual trading platforms - be it forex or crypto - are responding to the demands of their user base.\n\nWhy Bitcoin out of all cryptos\n\nBitcoin is still the most valuable cryptocurrency on the market.\n\nIt's consistently the cryptocurrency with the highest price point as well as the cryptocurrency that is consistently traded that most.\n\nFluctuating prices are at the essence of cryptocurrency, and Bitcoin is no exception, though. There is a lot of debate about whether or not Bitcoin should be considered a currency.\n\nDespite all the talk, Bitcoin is rapidly growing in popularity and a few countries recognize Bitcoin as a legal tender.\n\nBut there are also differences that one should be aware of when starting trading Bitcoin, no matter how short the horizon of your trade is.\n\nCrypto markets are still much smaller than forex\n\nThe biggest of the differences between Bitcoin and forex is the markets' liquidity.\n\nThe forex market has been around for a long time and its liquidity is estimated at $6 trillion. This is almost incomparable to the Bitcoin market which is \"only\" a multi-billion-dollar market.\n\nThe size of a market has a major influence on the volatility of that market. That factor in combination with the cryptocurrency market being unregulated makes trading Bitcoin a riskier type of trading, which you should always keep in mind.\n\nThe volatility of the markets\n\nEven though the forex market is volatile, cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin show a different kind of fluctuation.\n\nCryptocurrencies are unregulated and the price action is highly affected by online sentiment and other factors that are hard to predict.\n\nWhere the forex market is affected mostly by economic and political conditions, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are mostly affected by their own crypto ecosystem.\n\nLegal implications of crypto CFDs\n\nLast but not least, there are several legal implications of combining the two markets, especially in the US where trading CFDs is not allowed and crypto trading regulations are still in the works.\n\nIf you are to begin trading Bitcoin, forex, or Bitcoin on a forex platform, you must make sure that you are not breaking the law and that the platforms that you use are legitimate.\n",

      title: "4 Crypto Arbitrage Fails And How To Avoid Them",
      content: "With cryptocurrency's volatility, arbitrage trading in these digital assets can give you an excellent opportunity to generate more profits.\n\nHowever, executing an arb can be complicated and risky, just like other money-making ventures. This is where using an effective crypto trading strategy comes in.\n\nWhat is crypto arbitrage\n\nThere are various types of trading strategies a trader can execute: one of them is crypto arbitrage, or arb for short.\n\nIt involves buying an asset in one exchange and selling it on another platform at a higher price to turn the price difference into a profit.\n\nAlthough price fluctuations across various crypto exchanges allow you to make more money, it also comes with risks and other obstacles.\n\nMost common beginner arbitrage fails\n\nBelow are the four common crypto arbitrage fails and how to avoid them:\n\n\n  \n    Legal And Other Regulatory Considerations\n\n    Given the popularity of cryptocurrency in the financial market, rules and regulations are in place to regulate the use of these digital assets, especially in the trading world.\n\n    This poses a problem when you're using crypto arbitrage as a trading strategy, because you usually need to move money across geo borders.\n\n    Although crypto-related laws differ across geographical locations, most jurisdictions impose a general limit to the number of exchanges to use and digital assets to trade.\n\n    Due to these restrictions, you might be unable to get the most out of your arbitrage trading opportunities, like we posted way back in the day when people started thinking of arbing the kimchi premium in South Korea.\n\n    To avoid having your money stuck, it's essential to check the legal restrictions imposed by your state regarding crypto trading.\n\n    Even if you want to use for instance a bot for your Bitcoin arbitrage trading, you might have to check whether the software is allowed or has legal limitations on its use in your target market.\n  \n  \n    Volume\n\n    This is another crypto arbitrage fail that you should also be wary of when trading.\n\n    Typically, volume refers to the total number of contracts traded for a particular digital currency within a certain period. It's also defined as the measure of the market's liquidity and activity. For example, people own Bitcoin for buying and selling purposes. As such, it might be safe to say that there's a large volume of Bitcoin being traded in the market.\n\n    A problem arises when the crypto you're trading has too little volume. In that case, you won't be able to sell it for the price you need to break even. You can either sell at a loss or get stuck with your bag of altcoin for a long time, both probably resulting in financial losses for you.\n\n    To save yourself from this trading mishap, you need to check the volume of a coin and the daily transaction you intend to execute before using crypto arbitrage.\n\n    Check charting apps like Cryptowatch or Tradingview for volume information.\n  \n  \n    Trading Time\n\n    To explore several money-making opportunities with crypto arbitrage, you need to carry out a strategy as quickly as possible to ensure more profits.\n\n    Failing to act quickly increases your risk of losing because the market may move against your arb opportunity.\n\n    Entering into an arbitrage transaction that requires a long wait (such as when you need to deposit first) is a lost cause as the opportunity will disappear before committing your trade on time. Market conditions can change in just a few seconds.\n\n    To protect yourself against one of these crypto arbitrage fails, you might consider using tools to help you move fast to complete a trade with a profit. One such tool is an arbitrage trading bot which automates the trading processes. With an arb bot, you don't need to worry about logistics and significant market movements because the bot watches it over for you.\n  \n  \n    High Fees\n\n    If you're paying deposit and withdrawal fees for a trading transaction, these costs might only render the crypto arbitrage trading strategy useless.\n\n    Since you're dealing with different exchanges for arbitrage trading, the fees charged by these platforms might be too high that would undoubtedly take out a chunk of your profit.\n\n    Hence, instead of making more money, you might incur financial losses when you place a trade.\n\n    To avoid this issue, it's important to get familiar with the deposit and withdrawal fees and with the trading fees of the exchanges you choose.\n\n    You can create a spreadsheet to note the price differences in each exchange or platform. That way, you can plan your arbitrage trading strategy properly to ensure a more favorable and profitable outcome.\n  \n\n\nBottom Line\n\nGenerally speaking, crypto arbitrage trading can be an excellent strategy if you know how to do it in the first place.\n\nIf you're armed with proper knowledge, you can make trading a more profitable venture. However, learning everything about this strategy also includes the problems you need to watch out for.\n\nSo, if you're planning to use arbitrage trading, keep the information provided above to know which failures or risks must be avoided to gain more profits.\n",

      title: "EU AML proposal against unhosted crypto wallets: What to do to prepare for crackdown (legally)",
      content: "You may have heard about the new crypto regulation that was (just about) approved for advanced policy development stages by the European Parliament at the end of March 2022.\n\nIf you haven’t, essentially it’s a limitation or a possible crackdown on self-hosted wallets like Ledger or Exodus.\n\nAbout the proposed regulation\n\nThis new regulation is still not in it’s final stages, but it’s in a process of fine-tuning. There may by changes, but it looks like some version of the current proposal will get approved near the end of 2022.\n\nHere’s what is known:\n\n\n  The regulation: On Twitter by @paddi_hansen.\n    \n      TLDR, EU requires everyone who makes a transaction in cryptocurrency to collect, verify and report AML information about the counterparty.\n      The proposal counts with blacklisting for noncompliant crypto addresses, that is addresses who have no corresponding IRL entity documented.\n      In an earlier draft, it was proposed to ban transactions for self-hosted wallets entirely and in another iteration to ban addresses that don’t have a legal entity attached.\n    \n  \n  Responsible organ: ECON-LIBE, which are two committees of the European Parliament - Committee for economic affairs and committee for civil liberties.\n  Date: The last voting took place on 20 March 2022. The proposal was approved for further development starting April 2022.\n  Documents: Copies of the proposed regulation and of who voted how.\n\n\nRealistically, it looks likely that the AML documenting rule will be required only for transfers over certain value. With fiat currencies it’s 1k EUR, but the crypto regulation in its current iteration does not mention a minimum limit.\n\nIf you live in the European Union, and if the legislation goes through fully, it will impact you.\n\nIt might be better to make a move while there is still time - that is, if you trade, hold or stake crypto. There are a few easy things you can do to keep doing exactly the same in the future without breaching the law.\n\nWhat’s the danger\n\nSo, what this law proposal wants is to collect data to pair an IRL identity with a cryptocurrency address and all its history.\n\nThis is understandably done to collect taxes, but the real impact is that a full file of your personally identifiable information will sit in a database on an EU server, until it gets hacked.\n\nThen everyone will be able to buy (for Monero!) the database dump, including your photo ID, proof of address, crypto transaction hashes… Learning that somewhere at your filed residential address - probably in the bedroom drawer - there is a steel plate with a seed phrase key to 268 ETH, the owner of which being a pale 130 lbs nerd. Easy job!\n\nIt doesn’t get any better if you leave your crypto on an exchange, by the way. Almost all exchanges do full AML/KYC on you and will have to be submitting your file to the EU AML authority for your exchange withdrawals.\n\nHere’s what you can do\n\nIf you want to avoid both possible blacklisting and the impact on your privacy, start a one-man company in a country that already has a stable cryptocurrency regulation in place.\n\n\n  Acting as a company, your personal details will not be filed with your transactions - those of your company will.\n  Any possible dire version of wallet blacklisting will not concern you, because you will be able to tie a business entity with your crypto transactions.\n\n\nEstonia has one of the easiest systems to create business and work with cryptocurrency.\n\nUnder the latest 2021 laws, Estonian companies do not need any special license for most cryptocurrency activities except asset management for clients, exchange services and crypto custody services. You only need to apply for a license if you plan to trade or store cryptocurrency that belongs to your clients and charge a commission for that service, or if you plan to run a crypto trading platform. (Source: Companio.co agency reference docs)\n\nOff-license cryptocurrency activities for Estonian businesses include trading with your personal capital contributions to the company, trading with company profits and billing in cryptocurrency.\n\nYou can set up your company purely with cryptocurrency, too. Estonia allows any cryptoasset or token as the means of payment for your owner contribution to the company’s share capital. The minimum share capital for a company that doesn’t need a license is 2500 EUR. (Source: Same as above)\n\n\n  Here’s 50 EUR off the setup fees with one of the biggest agencies that help set up companies in Estonia. They provide the full service, from your identity registration in Estonia to your monthly and annual tax reports.\n\n\nCaveats you should know of\n\nThe following information is only intended as an overview and a stepping stone for further research, not as a financial advice.\n\n\n  \n    Taxes\n\n    Estonian companies do not pay any income tax on income that is reinvested. That is to say, unless you pay a salary to yourself or an employee, there is no income tax to pay. That’s one of the reasons why trading via an Estonian company is so convenient. (Source: A 101 reference guide at incorporate.ee consultancy)\n\n    Taxes on crypto may get complex though. The rules are based on the substance of the income: A cryptocurrency received as an invoice payment is treated differently than cryptocurrency actively traded.\n\n    So, before you act, always verify your information by talking to an accountant - here’s that 50 EUR shill link again.\n  \n  \n    Banks\n\n    An important caveat is that when setting up your Estonian company, at some point it may be necessary to take the trip to Estonia and open a bank account in one of the local Estonian banks.\n\n    The most common bank solution used is the remote setup provided by TransferWise (now just Wise).\n\n    Wise is a provider who has super low fees and will set up your bank account without traveling anywhere, but who unfortunately does not work with cryptocurrency companies.\n  \n  \n    Trading platforms\n\n    Practically, you will need to get corporate KYC on crypto trading platforms if you want to trade. You may run into difficulties with some providers: Cryptopay isn’t keen on accepting newly formed companies for instance, while FTX has a much less demanding corporate onboarding.\n\n    Generally speaking it helps to have some sort of past record.\n\n    If your company is new and your plan is to earn just by trading crypto, you should provide a proof that you are the only owner of your company and add trading logs or reports from the past, in your name.\n\n    If you don’t have those documents, you might need to first use your company to actually work (ew!) and build up until trading platforms stop considering your company too risky to onboard.\n  \n\n\nLastly, consider the impact\n\nAltcoinTrading.NET is a website for crypto traders, so by way of a conclusion I will list some of the potential impacts of the new legislation.\n\n\n  Only zero-knowledge P2P trades will not be directly impacted: P2P between two anonymous individuals in a zero-knowledge way does not provide anyone with the information of where the counterparties live.\n  There is a problem with onramping P2P though, like through LocalCryptos: For one, you choose your trades based on your geo location.\n  Smallest holders are going to be impacted the most: Even now the exchange minimums and withdrawal limits on exchanges are often between 10-50 USD. If there’s more paperwork added to it, the minimums will likely increase.\n  Barrier to retail entry into crypto generally will rise.\n  Total locked values in DeFi are possibly going to get way down.\n  Retail segments like NFTs and gaming are bound to be impacted the most, at least in theory, unless they are truly decentralized in a zero-knowledge way.\n\n",

      content: "\n  \n    \n      Hardware\n      \n        Ledger Nano X\n        \n        Top Commercial NFT Wallet\n      \n      (Good tech, good UX)\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Free NFT wallet\n      \n        Exodus Crypto Wallet\n        \n        Top Free NFT Wallet\n      \n      (Extra UI for SOL)\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  The blockchain has made the world of possibilities truly endless. Where we were once bound to physical and digital worlds and unable to live in both, now we can experience both at the same time. Just as you would secure your house with a lock, you must secure your NFTs according to its value.\n\n\nFirst off, consider what makes it valuable. For example, think of artwork that is rare and hard to come by such as an original Picasso painting or Messi’s autograph.\n\nThere are very few copies available and because there are so few out there the price tag will be high – this makes them attractive targets for thieves who wish to gain monetarily from something that was not gained fairly or invested into thus stealing away the work and effort of the original owner.\n\nDo you have to do anything extra for your NFTs?\n\nSo, NFTs are all unique snowflakes, but there’s millions of them.\n\nIf you are just collecting NFT airdrops to flip the jpeg as soon as possible, don’t bother buying a hardware wallet for it.\n\nYou can receive NFTs in free software wallets just fine - they are only tokens.\n\nFree crypto wallets that support NFTs:\n\n\n  Exodus supports ETH, SOL and other NFTs.\n    \n      A new feature called Exodus Gallery now gives you a nice UI to view, receive and send SOL NFTs.\n      You can store other NFTs in Exodus too, as tokens. They just won’t render in the pretty UI.\n    \n  \n  MyEtherWallet supports ETH NFTs, look for a tab called “NFT manager”\n\n\nExpensive NFTs may be worth it\n\nOn the other hand, consider what makes your NFT valuable to you.\n\nMaybe you are an NFT art collector who bought from one of the premium NFT marketplaces. Maybe you are a business-minded trader who is developing NFT in-game characters.\n\nNFT game characters have a well defined set of character properties that will make the price of the NFT soar on the market. The profit on NFT games is somewhat predictable, which makes in-game character trading a good business. But it also means that NFT game traders are in more danger of a heist.\n\nIf you have a NFT that is extremely rare and valuable, like the original art mentioned earlier, it will be better to be more diligent with your precautions than with any generic Pepe the frog artwork.\n\nLedger wallet is the standard\n\nBest hardware wallet that supports NFTs natively is the Ledger wallet nano X.\n\n\n  Ledger even provides an official guide on how to store NFTs on their wallets\n\n\nNFT game players or regular NFT traders will probably gravitate to the Ledger Nano X to make sure their trading is kept safe, but at the same time that moving their NFTs around isn’t a major clusterfuck.\n\nSo, Ledger hardware wallet has the native capability of storing non-fungible ERC-721 tokens. Furthermore, all updates, transactions and monitoring are now managed through the native Ledger Live app. This is better for the security of your NFTs, because you never have to worry about phishing emails with malicious updates. Simply update always via Ledger Live and ignore any wallet-related emails. It’s pretty secure.\n\nDon’t forget you need your seed\n\nThe standard of good security means storing your NFT in a hardware wallet in a secure location with no easily accessed areas. If somebody were to break into the house they should need at least an extra set of keys to get through all the locks on your door.\n\nEven better, the private key to the hardware wallet should be hidden in a different location. This is overkill for most traders and hodlers, but with life-changing amounts of money, it pays off to use a fire-proof and impact-proof steal metal sheet plates to store your seed phrase. You never know.\n\n\n  Billfodl gives 10% off on first order\n  Ledger now sells bundles of Nano X with Billfodls at a good price.\n\n\nThe extremely secure nature of this setup would make it highly unlikely that hackers will ever successfully gain access into your wallet.\n\nThird party for exotic blockchains\n\nLedger wallet has support of other types of wallets including MyEtherWallet (MEW) or MetaMask, which you can use to receive more exotic tokens.\n\nWallets like MetaMask are connected to Google Chrome, making them more easily accessible but also less secure.\n\nIt is a common practice to use browser-based wallets for smaller amounts of money, for tokens you send back and forth daily, but not for long-term storage of anything too valuable.\n\n\n  If you simply have a few airdropped NFTs, you’re fine using MyEtherWallet or MetaMask as your wallet for simpler tasks.\n  If you think you have something maybe worth hodling, use Exodus.\n  If you are sure you have a treasure, use Ledger and Billfodl.\n\n\nAdditional best practices when using MEW or MetaMask\n\nIf you are using browser-based wallets, always check for the green lock in your address bar. If that appears, then you know that you are connecting to the real site and it is safe to send your tokens there.\n\nWhen importing your wallet into MyEtherWallet, do not save any of your private keys anywhere online at all ever again. Save offline only on paper by typing out the seed phrase (12 words), writing them down and storing them somewhere safe.\n\n\n  It is safer to write the seed down than to print it out.\n  Use a pencil or a pen that won’t get ruined through water.\n  Best of all, use steel metal plates for seed storage - fire-proof, water-proof.\n\n\nAlso, obviously do not share your seed phrase with anyone.\n\nBy keeping you seed phrase offline, you are doing what’s best practice for keeping your wallet data secure.\n\nBottom line\n\nIf you are an experienced crypto trader or developer who has valuable NFTs laying around and/or plans on creating valuable NFTs - it might be worth investing in a hardware wallet such as the Ledger Nano X to keep your valuable assets safe from hacks and thefts while still being able to easily access and trade them.\n",

      title: "Crypto OTC: Platforms, fees, minimum settlements and general pros and cons",
      content: "Crypto OTC trading is a process of trading cryptocurrencies directly between two parties, “over the counter”.\n\nFirst off, the minimum limits for OTC are not that high anymore these days. You don’t need to buy the full mined block either.\n\nThere are several reasons why you might want to trade cryptocurrency OTC. For one, you get better prices than you would on the spot market.\n\nBut in case you already know that, jump right to the lists of crypto OTC providers:\n\n\n  Exchange-based OTC for spot-like trading\n  Independent OTC for best deals cashing out\n  P2P as OTC for trading small amounts\n\n\nOTC is better deal for both sides\n\nThe original Bitcoin OTC desks were based around mining companies who had access to loads of BTC.\n\nIt was convenient for them to sell bulk to avoid market slippage and exchange fees - for which reason it was convenient for their counter party as well.\n\nThe total costs of purchasing BTC ended up being lower for the buyer, and the total profits higher for the seller, as exchange fees accumulate with large trades.\n\nToday, most OTC providers are trading desks on behalf of crypto exchanges or independent financial institutions.\n\nThey get fiat and crypto liquidity from their own exchange activities and from partners - institutions and individuals. They do sometimes partner with miners and generally the model is still based on getting an asset cheaper and selling it with a margin that still makes it a better deal for both parties.\n\nHow does an OTC trade look like\n\nWhen you trade OTC, you get quotes directly with the other party rather than from the order book of the exchange. The biggest advantage is that you know upfront how much the total transaction will cost you, and that the transaction is done without delays.\n\nThese days that usually happens in a Telegram chat. You’ll be in a private chat with just you and a few trading desk operators.\n\nWhen you’re interested in making a trade, ask for quote. Some OTC will require you to name your side, e.g. quote to sell 10 BTC. But if you can, leave that out and request a quote for both sides.\n\nThe operator will name the total price for the transaction. That is the final total value that you will pay. You can reject or agree to execute that trade.\n\nOnce you agree on a quote with the counter party, your order is processed immediately. If you were selling, your fiat should be wired within a few hours. If you were buying, you need to wire the money within a time window - usually 24 hours.\n\nAlternatively, exchange-based OTC desks can use your exchange account balance instead. That makes it pretty much a spot trade, except with lower fees and no slippage.\n\nFee, Slippage and reactive traders on open markets\n\nOn the open market, you either have to use market orders to get filled ASAP, but that is really expensive, especially if you have no traded volume on the platform and therefore don’t qualify for fee discounts. The only other alternative is to do limit orders and wait until they are filled…\n\n…If ever. On smaller markets, the presence of a whale alone can cause a rally, which will move the market away from your limit orders and you will have to buy higher.\n\nWhen you trade on an exchange, your trades are public knowledge through the order book. So, you’re broadcasting the information that somebody is buying huge amounts of crypto. Active traders will notice even hidden orders, not to mention that again - they are expensive.\n\nHowever, when you trade OTC, your trades are not publicly visible on the exchange books. The volume you bought will still be visible in on-chain data, but it will look like a generic transaction or an internal movement. With OTC you are not trading the live offers from the books, but liquidity that was purchased before that, at a convenient price.\n\nAnother reason to trade OTC is for privacy. During many of the episodes of the China bans crypto soap opera, larger Chinese traders relied on OTC trades and smaller ones on P2P trades. P2P marketplaces run on the same principle as OTC, except they focus on small traded values.\n\n\n  A good P2P market is a zero-knowledge one like LocalCryptos (more here).\n\n\nExchange-based Crypto OTC desks\n\nIf you’re looking to try OTC, the fastest way to start is to use a regulated custodial exchange.\n\nPreferably one that you already use, and maybe one that is not infamous for charging outrageous fees (hello, Coinbase).\n\nMost regulated exchanges offer an OTC trading desk where you can buy and sell cryptocurrencies directly with less costs. The fees for OTC services are typically zero or lower than if you use the open order book on the same exchange.\n\nAnother advantage of using an exchange-based OTC is that you don’t need to pass the KYC/AML checks all over again because you are already verified on the exchange. Some exchanges will ask for additional documents or selfies, though.\n\nLast point can be both advantage and disadvantage: With exchange OTC desks, you get to use your exchange account balance, not necessarily your bank account. Holding money on the exchange brings additional risk, but it also means that your OTC trades will settle faster if there are no banks involved.\n\nSimply put - you will not get to make two intraday OTC trades if you need to wait for the fiat transaction to clear in your bank.\n\n\n\nThese are the top three of the exchange-based OTC desks for bitcoin and altcoins:\n\n\n  \n    Independent Reserve OTC desk - min. 50 000 USD\n\n    The Independent Reserve OTC trading desk has the lowest minimum size I was about to find.\n\n    Trades are settled in the same day in AUD, USD, NZD and SGD - they do process even international wires really fast.\n\n    Another advantage at Independent Reserve OTC is that you get to access alt coin markets that are not yet accessible through the exchange interface. Those include SOL, Terra, AVAX and more, as well as their crypto-to-crypto ratios. (Ratios are not available on the Independent Reserve exchange at all, other than at OTC.)\n\n    One potential disadvantage is that it is an Australian exchange and they do focus on the APAC geo. You won’t get a live agent outside of the 9-5 work day in Sydney time zone.\n\n    Another drawback is that trading fees follow a similar system as on the exchange - from 0.5% down to 0.02%, with volume discounts starting first at 100k. You will get a slightly better price than from the order book, though.\n\n    Costs of a 100k trade: 500 USD exchange / 480 USD OTC\n\n    Go to Independent Reserve\n  \n  \n    Kraken OTC desk - min. 100 000 USD\n\n    \n\n    Kraken OTC has higher minimum notional size but as a service it is more competitive than Independent Reserve. In 2020 the Kraken OTC desk already had 11 traders spread across Asia, North America and Europe, which means they trade and settle 24/7, no matter where you live.\n\n    You need to verify to level 3 on the exchange to access OTC at Kraken, but after that you can choose to use your exchange balance to trade OTC, or to pay off your OTC trades from your bank account or a self-hosted crypto wallet. The option to use your exchange funds makes it possible to make trades more often, even though the OTC desk is meant for less frequent traders.\n\n    If you trade from sources outside of Kraken, Kraken OTC requires you to settle your side within 24 hours. There are no lines of credit.\n\n    Trading at Kraken OTC happens via Telegram, Skype or Signal and on asking for a quote, you are given the entire value of the trade.\n\n    No fees get added to the quote, which makes OTC way cheaper than trading on the order book.\n\n    Costs of a 100k trade: 160-260 USD exchange / 0 USD OTC\n\n    Go to Kraken\n  \n  \n    FTX.com OTC desk - min. 100 000 USD\n\n    FTX International runs an OTC system which makes it possible to trade OTC even using the API.\n\n    The OTC setup on FTX is similar to Kraken’s in that your exchange and OTC accounts are tied together and you can source your trades from your exchange balance.\n\n    Again, this makes it possible to trade OTC more often (or even programatically), even though the OTC desk is meant for less frequent traders who do big volumes.\n\n    FTX charges no fees on OTC trading, whether from external sources or using your wallet - all costs are built into the quote you get. There is no lending system for OTC, but large entities can request a line of credit.\n\n    FTX does charge a withdrawal fee of 0.1% on fiat and stablecoins in case of new OTC traders.\n\n    Costs of a 100k trade: 20-70 USD exchange / 0 USD OTC\n\n    Go to FTX.com\n  \n\n\nIndependent Crypto OTC desks\n\nThe oldest and original OTC services were bulk deals done directly with bitcoin mining companies. Some of the business from the old days are still running OTC desks, even if they might no longer mine Bitcoin themselves.\n\nIndependent OTC desks tend to be less accessible to individuals though, and have higher minimum order sizes for OTC. That’s why they typically trade with exchanges, miners and large service providers.\n\nThat’s not the case for all of them, though, and you might expect a better quote from them than from an exchange OTC desk. Also, independent trading firms usually offer OTC derivative products as well.\n\nYou will not be able to trade as often - independent desks do not store your assets like exchanges do. You need to trade from your bank accounts and self-hosted wallets if you want to do independent OTC.\n\nFor that reason, the OTC desk will require a full KYC including proofs of sources of income and your professional CV to determine whether they want to trade with you.\n\nA good OTC desk will also execute a smaller test transaction to see if your bank will let you transfer money to the desk without any hiccups.\n\nHere’s what a B2C2 rep said on Reddit:\n\n\n  There are a number of benefits. You don’t have to move money onto the platform to trade, giving you more clarity on the price you’ll be paying. If our prices aren’t competitive, you don’t trade, you don’t have funds tied up, and you take on no couterparty risk. There’s no slippage, deposit/withdrawal fees (0.1%), no trading fees (0.1-0.2%). And yes, otc dealers can quite regularly beat the prices you’d get on the exchange.\n\n\n\n\nIndependent OTC desks ordered by lowest minimum settlement value:\n\n\n  \n    B2C2 - min. 50 000 USD\n\n    B2C2 is a London-based company authorised and regulated by the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority. They have three trading offices - London, New Jersey and Tokyo to be available 24/7 for a global client base.\n\n    The do not work with individual retail traders but they will serve you if you trade cryptocurrency on behalf of a company (which is now easily done in some European countries).\n\n    B2C2 trades BTC, ETH, LTC, BCH, XRP, EOS, DOT, UST, LNK &amp; USDC in fiat pairs.\n\n    The main advantage at B2C2 is obviously that the minimum settlement is low. They say that this is possible as they do electronic OTC. However, they will look at your aggregate volumes before they give you a quote. As a more established client you may expect better conditions.\n\n    B2C2 does not explicitly offer a line of credit, but their settlement terms are negotiable. This means that even though you trade from external sources, you might not be required to settle your side within 24 hours.\n\n    B2C2\n  \n  \n    Cumberland Mining - min. 100 000 USD\n\n    \n\n    Cumberland Mining trades with both individuals and companies who complete the full KYC. The KYC requirements are nothing over the top - just your personal information and source of funds.\n\n    Main markets traded are BTC and ETH, but they do have more assets available.\n\n    Cumberland Mining charges no fees, the quote you are given is influenced by supply/demand dynamics on the market and the company’s own position on the market.\n\n    OTC trading happens either via the usual Skype or chat messaging app, or programatically via an API.\n\n    Cumberland Mining\n  \n  \n    Genesis Trading - min. 250 000 USD\n\n    \n\n    Genesis Trading is available to “to select qualified institutional investors and accredited individuals”.\n\n    In their KYC process they want to verify that you own more than 10 MM USD worth of fiat or crypto.\n\n    In addition to OTC trades, Genesis Trading offers lending and borrowing services of at least 100 BTC, 1 000 ETH or 2 MM USD.\n\n    Genesis Trading\n  \n\n\n\n\nP2P as OTC\n\n\n  \n    Bitfinex\n\n    One exchange that didn’t make it to the list of exchange-based OTC desks is Bitfinex. Bitfinex does offer an OTC desk to verified users, the minimal transaction size is 100 000 USD and there is no fee added to the quote.\n\n    Bitfinex is not exactly known for stable banking routes, and so they didn’t make it to the list. But they do offer an interesting feature: They let you bypass the Bitfinex brokerage and trade directly with another OTC trader, as long as you know that trader’s OTC nickname.\n\n    The limits for these P2P trades are low (only 50 USD) but you get charged a flat fee of 0.1%.\n\n    Still, 0.1% is the taker fee you get on Bitfinex open market without a volume discount. That means that with P2P you get to have a maker trade for the price of a taker trade.\n\n    There is a cap of 10% over the market rate for P2P quotes.\n\n    Go to Bitfinex\n  \n  \n    LocalCryptos\n\n    Traders from certain countries always prefer a true P2P marketplace, which for many years was LocalBitcoins. That place started requiring a site-wide KYC, which means a lot of people left.\n\n    The only alternative since then are LocalCryptos, formerly an ETH market that now also trades BTC, LTC and other big cryptos. LocalCryptos is a zero-knowledge dApp, which means its operators don’t know anything about the people who trade there.\n\n    Quotes are not capped in any way, if you want to trade fast, it might get very expensive.\n\n    Go to LocalCryptos\n  \n\n\nFinal words\n\nThe final word is a word of caution.\n\nYou can also find OTC services on various forums and social media. Be careful when dealing with strangers - there are a lot of scams out there, and the experiences shared on Reddit are pretty clear about that: “(…) with a real desk, it was smooth. with a third party otc service to connect people it was pretty rickity.”\n",

      title: "Staking platforms: Where to stake in pools or independently in 2022 (ADA, ETH2 & more)",
      content: "The thing is, when you google lists of staking platforms, you’ll get mile long lists. But on sifting through all that, most of them are duds.\n\nSo let’s start directly with the meaty part. Here below is a list of the best staking platforms.\n\nIt only includes cold staking platforms and only platforms with ready-made products at that.\n\nThat is, platforms that offer validator node setups ready to deploy via a script in a few seconds, and platforms that run their own staking pools.\n\nCriteria judged in this list:\n\n  Dedicated providers only, no wallets or exchanges (that list is here)\n  Cold staking only, no DeFi staking (click here for that list)\n  No blackbox yield generation the way BlockFi or Midas do it\n  Supports multiple blockchains (ETH2, ADA, ALGO, KSM…)\n  Has ready-made servers so you don’t have to configure anything\n  Runs staking pools for small stakers\n\n\nThe platforms in the list below are ordered by the best terms for both large holders and small holders who want to use a staking pool while they build up.\n\nThere’s an outline of a staking strategy for small holders just below the list and a full explainer on the advantages of staking more crypto in the rest of the article.\n\nBest staking platforms\n\n\n  \n    AllNodes allnodes.com\n\n    \n\n    AllNodes is a US-based staking platform that has the best terms for both large and small stakers. They run a bunch of staking pools with completely symbolic minimum requirements (such as 1 ADA for ADA staking).\n\n    The pools charge a cut but AllNodes usually gives discounts to new pool stakers. They call that a grace period of 0 fees. For instance, you can stake MATIC for 115 days with no service fee on AllNodes.\n\n    Most popular staking pools on AllNodes:\n    \n      Terra Luna staking pool 0% commisson\n      ADA staking pool 0% commisson\n      SOL staking pool 0% commisson\n    \n\n    AllNodes also have one-click apps to run a masternode or validator if you are a larger holder.\n\n    The most popular validator app is the ETH validator.\n\n    AllNodes is just starting a new ETH product - The Rocket Pool, which is ETH2 Staking with only 16 ETH for 10 USD monthly fee.\n\n    \n      Go To ETH2 Rocket Pool - NEW! 16 ETH minipool\n    \n\n    At 32 ETH2, the validator node costs start at 5 USD per month, no service fee other than that.\n\n    \n      ETH2 validator specs\n    \n  \n  \n    BlockDaemon blockdaemon.com\n\n    \n\n    BlockDaemon is a great staking platform for large holders. Not so much for small ones.\n\n    BlockDaemon supports 50+ blockchain networks, and among that all the big ones - ETH2, ALGO, ADA, Elrond, DOT, KSM…\n\n    The platform runs very much in cloud platform style: They have high infosec standards, protecting customer nodes from common bot attacks and similar.\n\n    They offer a range of one-click apps through a public marketplace, kind of like Docker container images.\n\n    Off-topic here, but BlockDaemon now newly offers an DeFi staking product for large holders or institutions.\n  \n  \n    InfStones infstones.com\n\n    \n\n    InfStones runs tiered staking products and is therefore good for small, large and very large holders. They support 50+ blockchains including BSC and run their own staking pools for some of them.\n\n    For instance, InfStones have a staking pool for ADA and other cryptos popular among small holders. They won’t let you spin up a node automatically, but if you hold more than 6000 ADA, you are encouraged to contact them for a better solution.\n\n    InfStones is a good staking provider because it supports Binance Chain staking and ETH2 staking, which is not that common.\n\n    For ETH2 they have a partnership with imToken wallet, and a custom solution for over 320 ETH.\n\n    Other popular blockchains supported at InfStones are SOL or Terra.\n  \n  \n    BloxStaking bloxstaking.com\n\n    BloxStaking is a provider that only supports ETH staking, but it is open-source and very OG-style. ETH is a really popular currency to stake as even conservative crypto investors do not think it very risky to hold it. And so if you only care about staking ETH, not about any newer tokens, then BloxStaking might be all you need.\n  \n  \n    NodeForge nodeforge.io\n\n    NodeForge is a masternode provider. They specialize in niche coins (Aleph, Syscoin, Zen, Fusion, Anyswap) which are not usually to be found in big node providers. You can also contact them for custom solutions, if you are a whale.\n  \n  \n    CakeDeFi cakedefi.com\n\n    CakeDefi is a popular platform for DeFi staking, but they made it to the (last place of the) list because they run two masternode pools: A pool for DASH and a pool for DFI tokens.\n  \n\n\n\n\nStaking strategy for small holders who want to build up\n\nSet up a DCA into your coin of choice\n\nIf you want to hold a coin and stake it, then you are long-term bullish on it. And if you are bullish, it makes no sense to just HODL. You get way better return if you DCA, as shown here.\n\nJoin a staking pool with a minimum you can pass\n\nMost pools have a minimum stake requirements. But there’s tons of alt coins where the minimum stake is purely symbolic - 1 ADA is enough to participate at AllNodes ADA pool for instance.\n\nAs mentioned above, AllNodes is a good place for small crypto investors who want to start staking little by little. They give a grace period of 0 fees on pooled staking for an initial period. For instance, you can stake MATIC for 115 days with no service fee on AllNodes.\n\nTechnically, staking on exchanges is pretty much the same as staking in a pool. That’s what exchanges do - they pool user deposits. The problem is that they charge absolutely outrageous fees for that.\n\nThe ToS of Coinbase disclose a fee of 25% on your staking profits. Binance, FTX and Bitfinex do not disclose their fee, but by comparing the exchange staking yield with the raw blockchain yield reported at StakingRewards.com, 25% will be the mark everywhere.\n\nDo not stake on exchanges if 25% of whatever you stake is a nontrivial sum.\n\nTrack your staking yields\n\nAdd all your DCA’d coins into your staking contract and track your staking rewards. You will probably have to do it on your own and regularly, let’s say every two weeks.\n\nOnce you start making decent money, it will be time to decide whether the pool isn’t cutting too much of it.\n\nYou can always come back if you find that independent staking is not making more money than the pool.\n\nMove on to a staking wallet\n\nStaking from a wallet is a sort of mid-way. If you hold good enough an amount but you don’t want to be a validator, you can stake from your own wallet. It doesn’t have to be a full-node wallet.\n\nThere are several reliable staking wallets that you can get for free, such as Exodus. To stake the Binance chain and related coins, you will want the Binance-owned Trustwallet. Generally, most coins can be staked from a Ledger.\n\nAlways choose staking from a wallet over a pool or an exchange if you can - exchanges particularly will kill you on fees.\n\n\n\nWhy it all matters: The advantage of big money in mining and staking\n\nIf you’ve been around in the pre-altcoin times, you will know that in proof-of-work cryptocurrencies, having large amounts of resources available for mining makes for a huge advantage.\n\nThat’s how mining rigs on designated hardware, the ASIC miners, even came to existence. In the very beginning, people mined Bitcoin on their laptops and ASIC miners did not exist.\n\nThis leverage drove a lot of criticism: Mining of cryptocurrencies became centralized around geolocations witch cheap electricity, cheap labour, cheap materials - that was mainly in Asian regions.\n\nProof of stake was developed as the alternative algorithm, one that is more environmentally friendly and also one that limits the edge one can get from having a lot of resources available at once.\n\nThat does not mean the advantage has gone completely, though.\n\nBasics of cold staking: There is a small advantage\n\nProof of stake, the algo that powers cold staking, works by randomly selecting participating wallet addresses and including their transactions, while some amount of crypto is staked. You can then calculate an expected return from that.\n\nThis means that in network staking, you can’t simply buy the preference of the algo by having a better hardware. The only thing you can do is shift the odds into your favour. Naturally, you have a better chance with more coins available.\n\nSome of the avenues for gaming the system have been removed in newer PoS algos:\n\n  In classic proof of stake you need to have your coins available 24/7 to win the chance of being selected.\n  In delegated proof of stake, the probability increases if your coins are available more often.\n\n\nStill, your returns will vary depending on other users’ stakes - depending on how much they stake vs how much you stske - and it all also depends on the value of the staked amount you provide.\n\nThen there are the natural consequences of compounding interest, which most staking algos support:\n\nIf you win a chance to be selected for including transactions to blocks, you can either cash out immediately or continue staking. If you do not cash out, you gain essentially compound interest. Compound interest will naturally be more money if you started with a lot already, but additionally it keeps making you a bigger staker, which has an advantage as you might get picked more often.\n\nSo given equal amounts being staked at equal times, someone who stakes large amounts gets larger returns over time than someone who stakes a little.\n\n\n\nStaking pools: Staking for a fee, just like on exchanges\n\nIf you do not have a lot of crypto available on your own, you can join a staking pool.\n\nStaking pool is a service, provided for a fee, that stakes all the pool deposits at once, making it more likely to be selected for staking than a small holder would.\n\nPools charge a fee. The return you get from cashing out is thus lower than when you stake just for yourself, but if you have a really small amount to stake, you are better off joining the pool.\n\n\n  For instance, staking pools on ADA have a minimum participation limit of just 1 ADA.\n\n\nMost popular staking pools on AllNodes:\n\n\n  Terra Luna staking pool 0% commisson\n  ADA staking pool 0% commisson\n  SOL staking pool 0% commisson\n  ETH2 Rocket Pool - NEW! 16 ETH minipool\n\n\nDo not stick with staking pools when you don’t have to\n\nIn other words: There is an advantage when staking large amounts, and no advantage in using stake pools at all once you reach certain minimum limits.\n\nEven though there is an advantage in having big amounts available, there is also no point going further than necessary. At some point you will be better off staking independently.\n\nTop-Tier Independent staking: Running a Validator node\n\nRunning a validator offers the best possible profits, but also comes with risks.\n\nWhat is the difference between pooled staking and running a validator? In pooled staking, you send funds to the staking pool who then stakes for you. In independent staking, you run your own validator node and stake from your own wallet.\n\nRunning a  validator node always requires you to have a substantial amount of crypto. You can’t run a validator as a small holder.\n\nBut the returns are better: Validator nodes make profit in a different way than pools or individuals who simply offer their coins for staking. Validator nodes get a % of the transaction fees.\n\nWith that in mind though, if they do not win a block reward (getting included into a new block on the blockchain) and all your coins are locked up, they lose money. So validators need to diversify their staking offers.\n\nAs for other expenses, the costs of a validator upkeep over a long time are lower than in pooled staking.\n\nA validator node is pretty much a web server running an application, but the setup of the tech is mostly automated into a one-click app. No need to worry about IT costs, other than paying the server - which comes as low as 2-5 USD a month.\n",

      title: "Digital Currency vs Cryptocurrency: 4 Key Differences",
      content: "These days, there is nothing uncommon about believing that digital currencies are the best way to conduct transactions.\n\nBut to cryptocurrencies the world has warmed up only recently, and that especially in the financial sector.\n\nSome believe that cryptocurrencies are the future of financial technology, but many believe that digital currencies are the right compromise - not crypto.\n\nThe two terms seem similar at first glance, but there is a significant difference between them.\n\nDigital currency vs cryptocurrency\n\n\n  \n    Digital currency is a concept where money only exists digitally. Digital currency includes any monetary tokens or instruments that exist exclusively in electronic form. It can be used to buy goods or services through the internet.\n  \n  \n    Cryptocurrency is a type of digital currency that uses cryptography for security purposes. The encryption techniques regulate the generation of currency units as well as the transfer of funds. In that sense, encryption replaces what has been traditionally the task of a central bank. Since cryptocurrencies function independently from central banks, they have no physical form and cannot be controlled by any government or central authority.\n  \n\n\n4 Key Differences Between Crypto vs Digital Currencies\n\n\n  \n    Supply\n\n    Supply of traditional digital currencies is usually controlled by the issuing central bank. This means that they can increase and decrease the supply, which is commonly done to help the economy. The downside of this is that it devalues the currency over time.\n\n    Cryptocurrencies are not issued by a central authority. Cryptocurrencies are decentralized, and an algorithm determines their supply. So, for example, the total bitcoin limit is set at 21 million - there won’t be any more than that.\n\n    This means that you cannot increase or decrease the supply to benefit an economy. This advantage is that your money's value doesn't decrease over time.\n  \n  \n    Decentralization\n\n    Digital currency can be centralized or decentralized.\n\n    Centralized means that the digital currency is regulated by a central authority like banks, governments, etc.\n\n    Decentralized means that no central authority controls the money supply or, to a good extent, what is done with that money.\n\n    In cryptocurrencies, the most striking example of that freedom is not their use in crime, but rather the (thriving!) existence of products like dog money and meme tokens. If you are wondering where to buy Shiba Inu coin in UK for the best possible price, take a closer look at the detailed beginner's guide.\n  \n  \n    Privacy and Data Security\n\n    A traditional digital currency transaction usually requires clearing, that is the validation by a trusted third party, such as a bank or credit card company.\n\n    Cryptocurrency transactions are validated with mathematical algorithms.\n\n    The difference lies in the fact that it is impossible to counterfeit cryptocurrency, which means there is no need for a third party validation.\n\n    The result is that cryptocurrency usually provides better privacy than digital currency, which in turn means more security for their users: At least in principle, there is no need to share any personal data to use cryptocurrencies.\n\n    In the broad sense, this level of privacy is why finance is one of the first industries disrupted by crypto. People can now invest or yield income independently, such as via DeFi staking. In the past, this was a job for financial institutions who had literally no competition.\n  \n  \n    Third-party Validation\n\n    A bank or government authority validates transactions of legacy currencies to ensure the user has enough funds to cover the transaction in their account.\n\n    Cryptocurrencies use a blockchain. This immutable ledger records all transactions and updates in real-time across a network of computers without any third party involved.\n  \n\n\nConclusion\n\nCryptocurrency and digital currency are often used interchangeably, but as you have seen, in practice they differ substantially.\n\nCryptocurrency is a decentralized digital currency. No central authorities manage this form of digital money, so banks can't monitor or control it.\n",

      title: "What is grid trading? Where to run a grid bot to trade crypto?",
      content: "Grid trading is one of the most popular crypto trading strategies among people who do not want to manually trade. It is extremely easy to automate, and in the right market conditions it can make nice profits.\n\nTools &amp; templates for grid trading listed in this article:\n\n\n  Example of successful grid trading strategy\n  Best crypto grid bot platforms\n    \n      3commas - fully black box\n      Coinrule - template included\n      FTX Quant Zone - requires setup\n      Tradingview - requires either Coinrule account or coding\n    \n  \n  Best crypto for grid bot\n\n\nWhat is grid trading?\n\n\n  Grid trading is a style of short term speculation. A grid trading strategy uses multiple orders to capture price movements within a range of prices.\n\n\nYes you got it right, grid trading is basically a “buy low, sell high” with a fancy name.\n\nIn grid trading lingo, the grid is a channel created by placing buy and sell orders on the same market. When using a done-for-you grid bot like 3commas, you will need to decide on the grid limits by yourself.\n\nThe bot will analyse the volatility on your market, split your account balance into small parts and place your buy and sell orders without your input. Your orders execute automatically, too.\n\nFlat grid vs trending grid\n\nThere are two main types of grid trading strategies - flat and trending.\n\n  With a flat grid strategy, you set up your order grid between two price levels. This is the most basic grid trading strategy, all black-box trading bots use it.\n  With a trending grid strategy, you use a technical indicator to define the limits of your grid. Trending grid requires the knowledge of technical indicators and how to backtest them.\n\n\n\n\nFlat grid trading on Binance. Source: Coinrule\n\nIs grid trading a good strategy for your goals?\n\nGrid trading is a good strategy if your goals are making profits in terms of fiat, but you do not want to hold cryptocurrency. Let’s say you don’t believe in crypto, but you want to trade it for the dollar profits. In this case, set up a grid on ETHUSD.\n\n\n  A good grid on ETHUSD will give you stable profits in USD.\n  However, if some of your orders fail to hit, you will possibly end up with lower profit than if you simply held.\n\n\nIf you do want to hold crypto, but you still want to try this strategy, you can grid trade a ratio.\n\n\n  Grid on ETHBTC will give you profits in BTC.\n  Same limitation applies - you may end up with less profit than if you held ETH.\n\n\nA lot of it comes down to tuning your grid strategy to your selected market… Or to trusting a 3commas-style black box grid.\n\n\n\nSuccessful grid strategy example\n\n\n  A successful trending grid strategy can be buying every touch of lower Bollinger band and selling every touch of the upper Bollinger band.\n  A successful flat grid strategy is, after identifying a range, scattering buy orders within a set distance from the support and scattering sell orders within a set distance from the resistance.\n\n\nHoly marketing batman, but this grid trading sounded like something brand new, right?\n\nCombined rules for grid trading\n\n30M Bbands on an ETHUSD FTX market below, to show that it works - including the limitation mentioned in previous section.\n\nLook at the pink marks. You would get one buy missed between them, when the price action didn’t reach the bottom band.\n\n\n\nYour grid bot would buy the next touch and sell that again for profit, it’s just that the next buy would be at a higher price.\n\nIf this keeps happening a lot, your grid will be less profitable than HODL.\n\nThis is why grid bots usually make use of less strict rules.\n\nLet’s build a simple flat grid without stop loss:\n\n  If price has decreased of at least 1% from (value at the middle of the range)…\n  …and if price is still higher than 2600 USD…\n  …then buy for 10% of my account balance.\n  Or, if price has increased at least 1% from (value at the middle of the range)…\n  …and if price is still higher than 3000 USD…\n  …then sell previous order.\n  Run this 15x.\n\n\nThis flat grid will buy and sell at various places near your respective support and resistance levels, which will get your orders filled more often.\n\nIn the exact same way, in a trending grid with Bollinger bands, you could avoid misses by setting your grid trigger not at touching the bands, but within a certain distance.\n\nJust as a note: It is not immediately obvious, but sometimes lower amount of filled orders generates higher total profit over time. It can happen if each position closes with a higher profit, making up for the lower number of trades. Without backtesting you will not know which way will be more profitable.\n\nEntry and exit are not enough for a successful grid trading strategy\n\nThe Bollinger band scalp grid on ETHUSD in current market conditions would be profitable without a stop loss.\n\nHowever, knowing crypto, you should always set up at least a catastrophic stop loss. Far enough not to get triggered all the time, but still preventing really bad losses.\n\nSo, a successful grid trading strategy must have three components:\n\n\n  a sound entry strategy - that’s covered\n  defined risk management - meaning stop loss\n  money management - meaning position sizing\n\n\nEntry strategies can be based on indicators or price patterns. Risk management includes setting Stop Losses and Take Profits levels to protect profits and contain losses. Money management determines the size of each trade and the number of trades placed per grid.\n\nThis is all down to your risk appetite and preferences.\n\nBest crypto grid bot platforms\n\nA flat trading grid trades within a range of two price levels.\nThis is the simpler type of grid, when it comes to automation. But in 2022 there are grid bots for all levels of complexity.\n\nHere are the options, from the black-box, done-for-you crypto grid bot to the free stuff which requires a little bit of effort.\n\n\n\n\n  \n    [paid] Done-for-you blackbox grid bot - 3commas\n\n    If you do not want to bother setting up the rules at all, just use 3commas. The only thing it wants you to choose is the range within which to trade. The bot uses machine learning to scatter your orders through the range.\n\n    \n  \n  \n    [paid] Customizable, but user-friendly grid bot - Coinrule template\n\n    If you want to have better control over the profit size, use the Coinrule platform.\n\n    Coinrule template\n\n    This is a Coinrule template for a flat grid bot that buys and sells at a percentage distance:\n\n    \n\n    \n  \n  \n    [free] Customizable grid bot without nice UI - FTX Quant Zone\n\n    Yep, you can run loads of things on the FTX quant zone, and a flat grid bot is one of them. The only drawback is that you need to type a few lines of text into a box instead of shuffling a few boxes in a cute user interface.\n\n    FTX template (Quant Zone Grid Bot)\n\n    In FTX quant zone, you can set a single-direction rule to trigger an order. That means a grid bot on FTX will need two rules - the buy side and the sell side. The quant zone has moving averages and volume if you want to refine your rules with some technical analysis, but it accepts plain price level numbers too.\n\n    FTX quant zone template example for a grid bot’s buy side could look like the following: If ETHUSD is over 2600, and currently at least 1% below the 4H exponential moving average, place a limit buy at last price with 5% of my available balance.\n\n    If you don’t like working with a moving averge, you can make a true flat grid by just naming a price level. Just replace the EWMA in the trigger rules:\n\n     (price(\"ETH/USD\") &gt; 2600) and (price(\"ETH/USD\") &lt; 0.99*(ewma_price(\"ETH/USD\", 240)))\n    \n\n    Another Quant Zone rule will be needed for your sell side. The trigger could look like this:\n\n     (price(\"ETH/USD\") &lt; 3000) and (price(\"ETH/USD\") &gt; 1.01*(ewma_price(\"ETH/USD\", 240)))\n    \n\n    For both sides you, will need to set the actual order.\n\n    To test if this works, tick the “Post only” box there. If you make a “Post only” order on FTX, the system will place it but nobody will be allowed to take it. You’ll be able to troubleshoot your strategy without risking money.\n\n    \n\n    Here is the full recipe for the buy side of an FTX grid.\n\n    \n\n    Try it on FTX quant zone!\n\n    \n  \n  \n    [no added cost?] Any level of trigger rule complexity - TradingView (&amp; Coinrule)\n\n    This requires either coding skills or Coinrule subscription. As for coding, I mean actual programming, not just copypasting a rule trigger. But if you can do that, you can run a grid bot of any complexity at no additional cost.\n\n    You need to have a paid TradingView plan for this, so the total cost is not 0. But since most crypto traders have TradingView, there is no additional expense.\n\n    \n\n    The way this grid automation works is via TradingView alerts. Every alert you set up lets you send a message to a webhook URL:\n\n    \n\n    To trade on that message, you need to have that webhook configured somewhere. This is where you need either coding skills, or Coinrule PRO.\n\n    Coinrule platform has a built-in TradingView webhook listener in a paid plan.\n\n    \n\n    Get Coinrule\n  \n\n\nFiner points that might interest you\n\nGrid trading market fit\n\nGrid trading can be used in both forex and cryptocurrency markets, although with varying rates of success.\n\nFor grid trading in crypto, you need a market that is capable of forming of ranges. That’s not a given in crypto, especially not in small-cap alt coins. Alts that trade based off social media pumps are not usually good markets for grid trading either.\n\nBest crypto for grid bot\n\nBest cryptocurrency markets for grid trading are\n\n\n  Big markets and dino alts like BTCUSD, ETHUSD\n  Popular ratios like SOLBTC, ETHBTC\n\n\nWorst coins for grid trading are meme coins and any crypto that is undergoing huge fundamental changes. Those can be listing on large exchanges, social media hype or blockchain upgrades.\n\nGrid trading vs shadow system\n\nGrid trading is very similar to shadow system strategy known from forex. (There is a Strategy post on the Shadow System grid if you’re curious.)\n\nThe difference is that grid trading strategy doesn’t force closing orders daily. Also, even a flat grid may use technical or quantitative analysis to program your entries and exits. Shadow system uses pre-set take profit levels that work out to an overall profit after a few weeks.\n\nSo, grid trading is not a plain numbers game like the shadow system. It does use some discretionary trading methods and it does in part rely on the trader’s good judgement, not on average values over a long time.\n\nDepending on your skill in terms of entries, exits and stops, a good grid has the potential to outperform the shadow system. That’s especially true in trending crypto markets.\n\nGrid bots can run on TA or AI\n\nGrid bot does not have to use technical analysis to place your bids and asks. You can use any data to program your grid bot. Quants could probably come up with a bunch and 3commas uses an AI machine learning algo.\n\nSo, if you don’t have the experience to crank out a profitable custom strategy, then it is best to stick to some ready-made grid bot system.\n\n\n  If you prefer to use technical analysis, scalping Bollinger bands is always a fair game. Easy to set up in Coinrule.\n  Otherwise, 3commas is a black box grid setup. You don’t know how the AI decides, but it does have a built in risk management which is the key point here.\n\n\nBottom line\n\nIn general, cryptocurrencies offer a number of advantages for grid trading. They are 24-hour markets, which allows for more opportunities to trade. Volatility provides opportunities to take advantage of price differences. Cryptocurrencies also have a lower spread than forex markets, which allows for better profits.\n\nThere is plenty of tools for grid trading in crypto, and if you don’t need to have everything done for you, they can be pretty low cost as well. Always do your research and set your stop loss though; honeybadger doesn’t care.\n",

      title: "Launching a Token? Here's 7 Tips To Find The Best Blockchain Marketing Agency",
      content: "Every industry, including the blockchain industry, requires exemplary marketing to help good projects thrive and stand out in the said industry. It is necessary to stand out positively to build trust, attract customers and gain a user base.\n\nFor this, you will probably need a marketing agency. It’s a lot of work to get enough exposure in the industry now.\n\nHow then will you know who's the best agency and who's not? Worry not; this article will give you tips to help you with the selection process. Read on!\n\n7 things to always consider when choosing blockchain marketers\n\n\n  \n    Look At The Agency’s Marketing Strategy\n\n    There are various marketing techniques available that blockchain agencies utilize when serving their clients. They range from social media to content marketing and many others - not all of them effective and not all of them ethical.\n\n    Ask the blockchain marketing agency what method they'll use for your business.\n\n    Analyze these methods and see if the agency's approach aligns with your company goals and beliefs. The blockchain marketing agency you're considering might still be using old strategies like print or radio ads that may not be helpful for your business.\n\n    Or they might be using unethical marketing strategies such as misleading statements and insensitive content that may harm your business. Both of you should come to an understanding; if they aren't willing to accommodate your business beliefs, do away with them and continue the search.\n\n    When you're both on the same page, you'll have a smooth working relationship, and no party will feel dissatisfied.\n  \n  \n    Stick To Your Budget\n\n    Blockchain is a high-yield industry which makes for high costs of marketing.\n\n    Still, your budget should be your guiding principle when selecting a blockchain marketing agency.\n\n    You should seek the services of an agency that'll work with your budget and still offer quality services. From your budget, get the best value for it. You might be tempted to overspend due to the promises a marketing agency might be making.\n\n    However, please judge carefully here, especially in the blockchain industry. Remember, you still have other business operations that need financing.\n  \n  \n    Consider Experience\n\n    Experience is key since it determines the quality of services you'll get. Therefore, you need to ask the agency the number of years they've been in business.\n\n    More years in the cryptocurrency industry means they've worked with various clients and know what will and won't work.\n\n    However, besides focusing on the years in business, you also need to inquire about their success stories. How many clients did they have where their strategies worked? Ask for a list of references, whom you can call later to confirm their capabilities. This way, you can rest assured you're working with a competent agency.\n  \n  \n    Consider Location\n\n    Select a blockchain marketing agency within your target location so that you can be sure they are in touch with what your audience wants.\n\n    Proximity to your business would mean a faster response to any issues you have. But being in the same time zone if you aren't in the same locality is usually good enough. Alternatively, look for an agency that has a reliable communication tools.\n  \n  \n    Up-to-date With Technology Advancements\n\n    The advancement of technology they use will determine efficiency and effectiveness in serving your business.\n\n    Staying behind on the innovations in blockchain tech, it will make it harder for you to keep up with your competitors in the blockchain industry who are utilizing new technologies.\n\n    Do online research about the latest innovations in the blockchain industry and ask your marketing agency about them; inquire if they are familiar with them and whether they worked with them before.\n\n    Alternatively, seek insight from your IT team. They're much more knowledgeable about technology and know what features to look out for that determine a tool's performance.\n  \n  \n    Consider Flexibility\n\n    The blockchain industry is ever-changing, also in terms of regulations.\n\n    The best blockchain marketing agency should be flexible enough to adapt to any developments in the industry and regulatory space regarding Bitcoin or any other currency.\n\n    With them being flexible, you can be assured they'll streamline your operations to suit the changes. This way, your business won't be non-compliant in any way due to the lack of know-how.\n  \n  \n    Determine Their Team Size\n\n    An agency's team size indicates its capability to serve your marketing operations. How?\n\n    In most cases, you'll not be the only client the blockchain marketing agency will be having. Therefore, if the agency has a small team, how sure are you that they'll serve you efficiently? Won't their workers be overwhelmed with the workload and end up operating without considering quality? Where does this leave you as a business?\n\n    The marketing agency's team size is also a tell-tale sign of their competency. If a team is large, it means they have enough customers, and they're trusted by many other businesses out there. This gives you some assurance of their capability in service delivery.\n  \n\n\nBottom line\n\nAs seen, determining the best blockchain marketing agency for your business doesn't require that much. But every aspect discussed should not be taken lightly and be considered well for the success of your blockchain marketing. Implement the tips herein to select the best agency for your cryptocurrency business.\n",

      title: "The Progress of Crypto between 2021 and 2022",
      content: "So the year 2021 was a hectic year in the crypto market.\n\nNumerous things happened, from the break-out of Bitcoin to government crackdowns in China.\n\nMany crypto enthusiasts are now anxious to see how cryptocurrency fares in 2022. Even with the uncertainty of how deep the bear market will go, there is still plenty of progress to note.\n\nA Look-Back into the Year 2021\n\nCrypto has seen massive changes in market capitalization, but it has also become significantly more complicated for investors.\n\nThe early days were simple. You familiarize yourself with the cryptocurrency with the help of credible sources such as the bitcoin evolution review, go ahead buy Bitcoin, and hold that for several years as a long-term investment.\n\nToday, however, you have to be much more discerning in your assets.\n\nIn May 2021, there were over 10,115 alt coins on the market, and in the short nine months since then, too many new coins have come on the market.\n\nAs of now, there are 17,536 alt cryptos currently listed on CMC with a total valuation of over $1 billion.\n\nThe list is growing each day, as new ICO's (Initial Coin Offerings) raise hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars in an initial coin offering.\n\nWhen it comes to Bitcoin itself, the changes in price were impressive, even though most investors are looking back to 2021 with disappointment: The blow-off top type of price action only happened in dog money and similar alt coins in 2021.\n\nStill, over the past few years, Bitcoin has seen its price increase by more than 10x. In November 2020, the coin traded at around $15,233 per coin. Today, it is trading at around 40,000.00 USD per coin.\n\nSome coins have seen more significant growth over this period than others. Bitcoin has seen much higher growth, but some coins have done better than Bitcoin. These currencies are currently trading at much higher levels than a year ago. Some of these coins may become more significant investments in the future as we see more ICO's (Initial Coin Offerings) raise sums of money above $50 or even $100 million.\n\nCryptocurrency Adoption in Businesses\n\nThere is no doubt that the crypto technology is becoming a more and more popular tool as time goes on. You can tell this by the number of businesses accepting crypto coins as payment. The number of companies that accept Bitcoin has increased vastly since its inception in 2009.\n\nThis number is only growing as more and more companies realize the potential of accepting crypto payments. Amid growing sanctions and political measures even in countries like Canada, this growth is not likely to stagnate.\n\nCryptocurrency and the Future of Gaming\n\nCryptocurrency has spread far and wide beyond the borders of online gambling.\n\nEven before the rise of NFTs, it has also become a significant player in the gaming market.\n\nEvery week, over 30,000 users use cryptocurrency for gaming. This growth is because many gamers want to take advantage of the advantages that crypto offers when making payments.\n\nIt is much more efficient, secure, and cheaper than credit cards. It might come as a shock to some people because cryptocurrency has long been associated with gambling and illegal activities on the Internet.\n\nSumming Up\n\nThere is no doubt that crypto has made significant progress in the last year compared to 2020.\n\nCrypto has seen overall growth in market capitalization and adoption in businesses all over the globe. Of course, several coins have taken advantage of these opportunities better than others.\n\nThe market is still very young, and numerous coins have not seen their time to shine yet.\n\nHowever, there are plenty of new ideas and technology solutions that are coming out of the woodwork each day with the hopes of making history.\n\nOverall, it's looking like cryptocurrencies will continue to grow as a technology and solution if not as a price speculation tool during the rest of this calendar year.\n",

      title: "6 Industries Being Disrupted by Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies",
      content: "By 2022, the popularity of cryptocurrency has at last trickled down into the industries.\n\nExperts from various niches are discovering new uses and applications for blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies, and this is why they are starting to challenge established practices in various sectors.\n\nSome sectors and industries have discovered that blockchain and cryptocurrencies are a better tool for important parts of what they do. Let us look at six industries that are being impacted by blockchain and cryptocurrencies.\n\n\n  \n    Cybersecurity\n\n    We live in a digital world now which means we have to contend with security threats online and within the systems we use. We have already seen various security breaches that had led to the loss of vast amounts of data as well as billions of pounds around the world. Blockchain is being used to thwart such threats by helping businesses and individuals alike secure their data while also disallowing unauthorised access.\n\n    Blockchain is a decentralised system which makes it an excellent option for this application. All the data that needs to be stored securely is stored in a decentralised blockchain network. All this data is encrypted and verified by the network which leaves no point of entry for a malicious actor.\n\n    Additionally, it is easy to identify unauthorised access because the data cannot be altered and if it is, there is a permanent record of what was tampered with.\n\n    Blockchain also removes the need for a central storage system meaning that there is a completely secure and transparent system for recording all transactions. These transactions are private so they can only be accessed by authorised users.\n  \n  \n    Banking\n\n    Banking is perhaps the industry that will be impacted the most by blockchain and cryptocurrencies.\n\n    If you want to send money through the banking system, you will be charged transaction fees, meaning you will either spend more money or send less money. If the recipient is overseas, you also have to contend with international transfer fees, currency conversion and other charges. Add no guarantee for secure transactions and you begin to see why people have been clamouring for a better system.\n\n    Blockchain and cryptocurrencies are disrupting banking by proving a peer-to-peer money transfer alternative. Cryptocurrencies are highly secure, anonymous, typically have lower fees than bank transfers and their transfers are faster too.\n\n    Many of these benefits come from the fact that there is no central authority that you have to pay or wait for to authorise transactions.\n  \n  \n    The Casino Industry\n\n    Cryptocurrencies' properties make them a great option for payments at online casinos. They allow for pseudonymous, fast, secure, and larger deposits, qualities that most legacy payment options do not have. For example, a cryptocurrency deposit at an online casino might take 10 minutes, but the same deposit might have taken a few hours to a few days to complete using a payment option like a bank transfer.\n\n    Most people who use online casinos as an entertainment are not too keen on having their casino accounts associated with their identities. Cryptocurrencies are the obvious option for these types of people. With cryptocurrencies, you do not have to give a casino any of your personal or banking details. All they would need is a cryptocurrency wallet address and you can deposit or withdraw your funds.\n\n    Your cryptocurrency wallet can be still associated with your identity, but it is an extra step, not a requirement.\n\n    Lots of casinos have realised there is a lot of demand for the use of cryptocurrencies on their platforms and they now allow you to use this currency.\n\n    Those of you from the UK interested in using cryptocurrencies as a payment option on online casinos can check out reviews of the safest sites that accept bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies at OnlineCasinos. These casinos have been reviewed by experts to ensure they are not only safe, but that they also provide a superior experience for all players. You can read their reviews to find information on their games, licensing, bonuses and more.\n  \n  \n    Healthcare\n\n    Healthcare data is highly valuable, but the sad thing is that it is stored in central servers that can be broken into.\n\n    All of this private information can be sold or used for nefarious purposes without your authorisation. Additionally, it might take a long time to get the data you asked for once you request it and there is no way to know if a healthcare worker has taken any of your data out of their system.\n\n    Blockchain removes the need for central storage while enabling faster access to data. Data is stored in blocks and then the blocks are connected to other blocks on the network. With data distributed like this, it becomes harder to corrupt.\n\n    Blockchain is also being used to trace counterfeit medication. By using blockchain to put supply chain management protocols in place, it becomes easier to trace the source of any medication used in a healthcare facility.\n  \n  \n    Supply Chain and Logistics\n\n    Blockchain records all the steps in a supply chain.\n\n    By doing so, it enables traceability that makes it easy to deal with and resolve issues that come up with a product. When a customer makes a complaint, the retailer can go through the records, step through them, and identify where the issues arose in the supply chain.\n\n    Blockchain gives all players in a supply chain permanent transparency and allows the validation of all transactions that happen between multiple players in that system.\n  \n  \n    Governments and governance\n\n    Although governments are not an industry, voting is an important area of governance that has to be mentioned in this discussion.\n\n    Blockchain can help end voter fraud. A blockchain network allows people to vote however they want, and each vote is recorded in the network. These votes cannot be changed, and each person can only vote once because each vote is tied to only one ID. There will also not be an issue of ghost voting because each vote needs to be tied to an ID for it to be valid.\n  \n\n\nConsidering all the uses we can get out of blockchain technology, there is very little doubt that it will play a critical role in shaping our future.\n\nBlockchain and cryptocurrencies are still relatively new so there are many other areas where they can be used - uses that we are yet to discover.\n",

      title: "Shiba Inu Coin by 2025 - Fundamentals and Predictions",
      content: "\n  In the spring of 2021, the crypto-currency market was blown up by meme-coins. Before the advent of the Shiba Inu coin (SHIB), few believed that its success could be repeated. In this article, we will look at how the fiat value of this coin could reasonably develop by 2025.\n\n\nMeme coins are community-based\n\n2021 was the year of the meme coins boom, and the Shiba Inu coin was one of the most popular ones.\n\nThe Shiba fans on Reddit and the \"Shibetoshi Nakamoto\" Twitter handle have been very vocal about the \"Dogecoin Killer.\" This is one of the main reasons why Shiba's price went up by more than 1,000% in the fall of 2021.\n\nThe Shiba Inu community is the reason behind its popularity.\n\nWhen people started purchasing SHIB, they created a demand that was not met by supply available on exchanges. (Not by actual total supply, alas, but the price still responded.)\n\nThis run-up happened in May 2021 when many Dogecoin holders decided to switch to Shiba. Its market cap grew to over $30 billion — more than what Dogecoin had at that time.\n\nSince then, SHIB has been one of the most popular coins as its price shot up to astronomical levels. The price of the Shiba Inu coin is currently around $0.00003.\n\nHere's the February 2022 SHIB data:\n\n\n  \n    \n      Price ($)\n      Market Cap ($)\n      Circulating Supply\n      24h Trading Volume ($)\n      ROI From Initial Price\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0.000032\n      Over 17B\n      549,063,28B\n      2-5B\n      1926414.62%\n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n       \n       \n    \n  \n\n\nPreviously, the coin has seen highs of over $0.00008 and lows that equal almost zero.\n\nFundamental Catalysts for Shiba Inu Price Fluctuations\n\nThere are a number of catalysts driving price fluctuations, including the following:\n\n\n  \n    Exchange Listings\n\n    Shiba Inu has been listed on large exchanges, such as Binance and Uniswap. This makes it much more accessible to investors around the world. The exchange listings drive up demand for SHIB and push its price higher.\n  \n  \n    Exchange Rules\n\n    It should also be noted that on some exchanges, SHIB (and some other coins) have a relatively high limit for minimum transaction.\n\n    For instance you will notice on Bitforex, you will be able to buy or sell most alt coins with as little as 2 USD worth. The SHIB transaction limit is set to 400k SHIB though.\n\n    At the peak of the market in October 2021 that came up to be 32 USD worth of dog money for minimum allowed transaction.\n  \n  \n    Social Media Community\n\n    Shiba Inu has a strong community with millions of followers on social media. This helps to create a positive sentiment around the coin, which drives up the demand and the price.\n  \n  \n    Influential People\n\n    Elon Musk's tweets about cryptocurrencies have led to enormous price fluctuations in the past.\n\n    Shiba Inu is not an exception to this. Last year, Shiba gained nearly 65% in value in a single day after Musk tweeted a picture of his Shiba Inu dog.\n  \n  \n    Switching to Its Own Blockchain\n\n    Shiba Inu was first launched on the Ethereum network. It recently started migrating its data onto its own blockchain by sharding the ShibaSwap data on its blockchain.\n\n    This means that Shiba Inu will no longer be running on Ethereum's network. And it will not incur transaction fees to use the ShibaSwap platform. This makes Shiba more attractive as an investment since there will be no associated costs with its usage.\n\n    Although, this doesn't change the fact that Shiba is still a token. Its blockchain is not live yet. But this news has been a significant factor in Shiba's price increase.\n  \n  \n    ShibaSwap Bets\n\n    Just like futures and derivatives in the traditional stock market, there are also ShibaSwap bets on Shiba Inu.\n\n    This is where traders bet on the future price of a cryptocurrency. When they think that the price will go up, they buy Shiba contracts. And when they think that the price will go down, they sell Shiba contracts.\n\n    This drives up demand and prices in the ShibaSwap market, which cascades over to SHIB's spot price.\n  \n\n\nShiba Inu Price Predictions\n\nMost price predictions seem to be bullish. And many experts believe that it will only continue to go up in value.\n\nShiba Inu Price Forecast 2022\n\nAccording to cryptonewsz.com, SHIB could be worth as high as $0.0000623 by the end of 2022.\n\nDigitalCoinPrice takes a less bullish approach, predicting that it will only be worth $0.0000424 by the same date.\n\nShiba Inu Price Forecast 2023\n\nBy 2023, Crypto Newsz predicts that Shiba Inu could reach a surprising $0.0000711.\n\nDigitalCoinPrice predicts that it will be worth a more modest $0.0000498 by this time.\n\nShiba Inu Price Forecast 2024\n\nFor 2024, the latest forecast by Crypto Newsz suggests the \"Dogecoin Killer\" will reach as high as $0.000079. This would be a 250% increase from the 2022 value.\n\nAlthough not as optimistic, DigitalCoin Price's prediction for the same year is still high — with the Shiba Inu coin reaching $0.0000493 by 2024.\n\nShiba Inu Price Forecast 2025\n\nCryptonewz.com brands 2025 as the \"benchmark year\" for Shiba and predicts a price of $0.0001, while DigitalCoinPrice forecasts that it could be worth $0.0000672 by the end of 2025.\n\nAs you can see, the consensus in price predictions is that Shiba reaching $1 is highly unlikely.\n\nJudging from the latest Shiba Inu price prediction 2025 data, the highest ever prediction is $0.0001.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhichever prediction you choose to believe, one thing is for sure: Meme coins are popular, people love trading them and they look poised to continue getting listed on high-profile exchanges.\n\nIt may be a rollercoaster ride but if you’re that type of trader, meme coins might be a good fit for you.\n",

      title: "Crypto classes are a real thing: What do future 'crypto experts' struggle with?",
      content: "There is no better proof that crypto is slowly taking over fiat money than seeing educational institutions launching degrees related to crypto.\n\nEven though the move has drawn plenty of attention, and many people consider blockchain degrees a fad, it's nonetheless a vital sign that the crypto world has been developing rapidly, letting people achieve financial freedom.\n\nBe that as it may, majoring in such courses is far from elementary. Many students have no prior finance or blockchain knowledge when enrolling in crypto programs. Just like many traders, students are led by fairy tales that crypto instantly means high profits and no significant efforts.\n\nThese illusions often result in students hitting rock bottom in their studies, with long tales of missed deadlines and, what's even more critical, insufficient knowledge in the area.\n\nWhat help do students in crypto finance classes look for?\n\nBut what help do students need and should get with finance crypto assignments? Let's examine the question more profoundly right below.\n\nFull-fledged help\n\nAs said above, some students aren't genuinely interested in crypto. Living in a dream that their crypto journey will take off and bring in enormous profits upon graduation, they forget to put enough effort to let that happen.\n\nThe time they start learning and comprehending the crypto industry will determine their ultimate success. In the beginning, it's OK to reach out to experts and get professional finance homework help. Such writing services will provide exemplary papers to know what an A-deserving work looks like.\n\nAlternatively, students are encouraged to turn to private tutors and attend crypto classes outside academia. This type of cooperation is more costly than the mentioned one. Many people often question the need for hiring tutors these days (precisely because of the number of available guides, tutorials, and videos on the web).\n\nBe that as it may, private teachers are still in demand today because they offer a personalized approach and focus on students' merits and demerits.\n\nExtra help\n\nNeedless to say that the vast majority of students are determined to become crypto experts (and work with crypto in various formats), interested in what they're studying, and enthusiastic about classes and lectures.\n\nAnd while a large part of those students demonstrates impressive progress learning individually, others still face tremendous difficulties dealing with the curriculum. In these instances, extra outside help may come in handy. But the question of what help can be advantageous might arise. The following are various things students would benefit from.\n\n\n  \n    Insight knowledge\n\n    Getting some specific knowledge in the crypto industry would be of great use for students because the latter often deal with ordinary things and follow syllabi, omitting many crucial elements. Not only will it help students apply their skills obtained during classes, but it will also provide them with the knowledge they can use when doing homework.\n  \n  \n    Thorough explanations\n\n    Although opening crypto degrees was inevitable, we can't praise such courses too vigorously. The main problem is that many teachers aren't professional enough to lead crypto classes. While they might indeed know how the industry operates and how to trade successfully, they may lack that ability to teach others and provide crystal clear explanations.\n\n    As a result, students may confuse various terms, from being unaware of the main differences between proof of stake and work to more solid aspects, like futures.\n  \n  \n    Experience\n\n    Another problem that might hamper students' success is insufficient experience. Instructors often lack it, so it is not surprising that students don't have it either and only start gaining it upon graduation. But that's not how it should work. In an ideal scenario, students should have ample experience trading crypto and know how to work with it, do technical analysis, etc.\n\n    Of course, that's a perfect way. Rarely do students of any degree get plenty of practical knowledge before finishing their studies. More to the point, students need to gain experience, at least in that observational form. Interacting with other skilled crypto traders listening to their thorny paths and recommendations will positively influence students and cast light on the actual field.\n  \n  \n    Real-life cases and lessons behind them\n\n    Besides communicating with crypto gurus themselves, it would be excellent to provide students with various cases touching upon cryptocurrencies. Finance degrees heavily rely on case studies. Learners often pick a case related to their specialization and study it, analyzing methods, results, and overall success.\n\n    The same goes for crypto; students will profit from studying cases and learning the lesson behind them.\n  \n\n\nAcademia and the crypto world\n\nLast but not least, it'd be reasonable to talk about academia and crypto.\n\nOnce again, there is no denying that this step is terrific. Colleges running crypto courses not only show they aren't influenced by the government, who are primarily against the spread of crypto.\n\nNonetheless, academic institutions in their current relationships with crypto have several issues to come to grips with and resolve swiftly.\n\n\n  \n    The crypto industry changes daily, curricula are static\n\n    Some altcoins fade away, while others keep fighting for the place in the sun and have a high chance of winning. The world of cryptocurrencies is fluid and changes daily, which we can't say about academic curricula. With all due respect to teachers, such fixed syllabi do no good to students, making them stick to things that have much more effective alternatives.\n  \n  \n    Provide outdated knowledge\n\n    Similarly, many learners are filled with knowledge they will never use in their professional careers. Instructors tend to carry out lectures and scratch the surface only, which doesn't clarify pressing matters.\n  \n  \n    Lack of focusing on practice\n\n    Cramming theory is sometimes necessary. Unfortunately, it's too much with cryptocurrencies. Although learning about DeFi, Coinbase IPO, Crypto Banks, Institutional Adoption, and a wide array of other topics by reading tons of literature is important, it's equally essential to have the chance to implement such knowledge from time to time to know what works and what does not.\n  \n\n\nRecap\n\nThe crypto industry is in the spotlight, sparking more and more attention every day. We'll only observe an increase in students willing to obtain academic degrees in crypto. Educational institutions know that and prepare to roll out new crypto courses to fill the demand.\n\nWith all their current flaws, the quality of such degrees will improve soon. For now, those students who've already started crypto courses and are seeking help can use some of the above suggestions.\n",

      title: "4 Benefits Of Using A Crypto Trading Bot",
      content: "Through the years, cryptocurrency trading has become a profitable venture, popular not only in the financial industry.\n\nWith proper trading strategies, many people have gained profits through trading or through staking and other means of decentralized financing.\n\nHowever, trading crypto can also be challenging, especially if you have no idea where and how to start. Since the crypto market operates round the clock, trading can become more complicated if you find yourself spending more time managing your portfolio.\n\nAlso, given the crypto market's volatility, you may have to deal with the emotional toll of checking your portfolio now and then to see if there are gains or losses. These situations can make crypto trading a much demanding and arduous venture.\n\nBecause of the psychological effects, some traders and investors have started to embrace the use of a crypto trading bot. A trading bot is an automated software is intended to analyze, monitor, and carry out trades across different exchanges.\n\n4 Benefits of Trading Automation\n\nWe’ve made a list of the best no-coding bots available for crypto before.\n\nHowever, if you're still uncertain about how this software can help, below are some of the benefits of using a crypto trading bot you need to consider:\n\n\n  \n    Ease Of Use\n\n    If you want your crypto trading experience to be as seamless as possible, then it's best to use a crypto trading bot from the get-go. It's an easy-to-use software because everything can be done with a few clicks. With a trading bot, you can list all the assets you want to trade, and it'll do the rest of the job for you. It can place trades on your behalf using the strategies you've chosen.\n\n    For example, if you're trying grid trading as a strategy, you can reduce the overall manual work by using an automated trading program. This means that even if you're sleeping at night, the bots for grid trading can execute the trades for you, making the entire process much easier and more convenient.\n\n    Thus, if you're looking for the perfect trading bot, you can visit some review sites to get familiar with the best options for your trading situation.\n  \n  \n    Time-Saving\n\n    Typically, cryptocurrency trading requires considerable time to obtain a more favorable outcome. If you want to succeed with this undertaking, you need a lot of time and patience to get it done right. However, pouring most of your time into trading crypto may not be a good idea, especially if it starts to affect your personal and work life.\n\n    As such, a crypto trading bot can be an excellent solution. With this automated program, you can save more time because it'll handle the job for you. You don't have to keep an eye on the software from time to time to check whether the price changes. Consequently, you still have extra time to do other essential activities without compromising your trading efforts.\n  \n  \n    Efficient Trading And Faster Processing\n\n    Another benefit of utilizing a trading bot for cryptocurrency is its ability to multi-task. Unlike humans, they can still carry out trades while concentrating on another task, such as analyzing multiple currencies. This setup makes cryptocurrency trading an efficient venture.\n\n    In addition, having a trading bot by your side can also help ensure that you won't miss a potentially beneficial trade. Since the market is highly volatile, it's essential not to take too much time to execute a trade.\n\n    So, if you want to get the most out of profits, it's best to use a free crypto trading bot capable of making instant orders. As a result, you can minimize the potential risk of financial losses in the long run. To ensure you pick the right one, you can check out some review sites to help you make a sound decision.\n  \n  \n    Emotions Are Eliminated\n\n    Generally speaking, emotions play a role in the success or failure of a specific trading effort. Most investors make the mistake of trading or investment decisions based on their hunches and feelings, which potentially results in significant financial losses. This is where using an automated crypto trading platform comes into play.\n\n    With a trading bot, you don't need to worry about emotions. The software doesn't have feelings or attachments to the trading positions involved. It can place a trade position for you with more clarity and better choices, thereby improving your chances of gaining more profits than losses.\n  \n\n\nBottom Line\n\nCryptocurrency trading can be a lucrative way of generating more profits and diversifying your portfolio. But, when it's done incorrectly, it can also lead to significant financial trouble as well as some mental and emotional issues. Due to these circumstances, utilizing an automated trading bot may be a good idea.\n\nBut, by keeping the benefits mentioned above in mind, you can decide whether this modern technology can be the perfect solution for your trading efforts. The more you know how the bots work, the more you can make your trading journey a success.\n",

      title: "Market Psychology: TradingView tools to read it",
      content: "Market psychology is the term used to describe the feelings, emotions and attitudes of traders on your market. The activity of traders and investors are what causes market prices to move. But it’s not only their market opinions that is typically reflected in price movements - it is their risk attitude and psychology as well.\n\nYou must have heard about fear and greed: For example, if a market falls by 10%, part of it may be that participants are selling on fear.\n\nReading the psychology of the market is one thing though, acting on it another one.\n\nIf you find out that majority of other traders act in a fearful way, it doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s a good idea to join in on that.\n\nWhen to follow the psychology and when to act contrarian?\n\nAs a rule of thumb, if you are going for a short term trade, like when you are daytrading or scalping, you will most often follow the prevailing psychology of the moment. Not always, but typically.\n\nIf you are building up a position that you want to hold for months, you will often often be contrarian at the start. You will typically be looking for an entry before the market has definitely turned in your direction. Again, there are other ways to do it, too.\n\nTools to check market psychology\n\nSo, it can be a good idea to follow the market just as to go against it.\n\nProbably the closest to a systematic rule is to look at patterns it makes, starting with the most trivial ones, progressing to more complex ones.\n\nCandlestick patterns, simple shape patterns and momentum indicator patterns are exactly the same on all markets. The difference is how the markets reacts to them.\n\nIn the most mature market you can then also look at how the big players are reacting to them by watching theor actions on derivative markets.\n\n1 - Simplest candlestick patterns that indicate market psychology\n\nThe simplest way of looking into the psychology of the market you want to trade is to look directly at its price action and the patterns it forms.\n\nBasically, all jumpy and abruptly changing patterns are indicative of either strong fear or strong greed.\n\nBRDs indicate fear.\nBGD and similar abrupt bullish jumps indicate greedy market.\nThis is pretty plain. In small altcoins that are just being hyped or just starting to crash you are usually better off following these sentiments literally. No offence in that - Bitcoin was like this once, too.\n\nTools\n\nYou get to see these simple patterns on any TradingView chart. If you want to get a bit richer information, use the spacetrader’s free TradingView script called “Volume Flow”. It will colour your candlesticks based on volume traded in that time segment.\n\n2 - Basic chart patterns that show market psychology\n\nWith markets where you can expect a bit more depth, it will pay off to look for some of the classic tell-tale patterns.\n\n\n  Bart Patterns and strong rejections on local resistance levels indicate weakness, traders bail easily.\n  Bull flags and retracements that bounce well and on good volume indicate strong market that is recovering easily.\n\n\nOn these markets, more traders are choosing whether to trade it for the short terms or whether to set up for a longer position.\n\nTools\n\nIn any market that can Bart well and bull-flag well, you will probably do good short term trading with daily volume profile. Here is the free 1D volume profile on TradingView and here’s how to trade it.\n\n3 - Technical patterns that show market psychology\n\nMarket ranges indicate the market is all-in-all strong and has loads of diverse participants. That itself is “good” market psychology for the long term.\n\nIf you are trading a market that is mature enough to make ranges, you will want to look at real technical indicators to gauge the situation. There is a bit too many diverse players to judge the overall situation simply from looking at the price action.\n\nUseful technical indicators for mature markets include:\n\n\n  Bollinger bands\n  Oscillators like relative strength indicators (RSI)\n  Movement indicators like Rate Of Change\n\n\nAs a note, when you are looking at these indicators, you are often looking for signs of reversal. In other words, you are looking for a way to enter the market in a contrarian way. This is a change from the previous section, and you should choose your markets carefully. Tons of alts do actually die and never recover.\n\nTools\n\n\n  \n    Rate of Change\n\n    ROC is the only one that can be used “out of the box” as a confirmation of a movement that is just starting. ROC is literally just measuring the rate of advance of the price action.\n\n    So, for a bullish action to have legs, it should be definitely safely in the positive area.\n\n    ROC is one of the default indicators available on Bitfinex.\n  \n  \n    BBands\n\n    BBands are just a rolling standard deviation of the price, they paint the threshold up to which the price most typically moves.\n\n    Bollinger Bands work remarkably well in crypto markets when it comes to the two most classic patterns: The three pushes to indicate topping out, the W-bottom for the bottom reversal.\n\n    You look at the highs and lows relative to the band, not in terms of price.\n\n    That can put you a tiny bit ahead of the crowd if the market makes, let’s say, a lower low in terms of price, but a higher low in terms of BBand position, which indicates strength.\n\n    The three-push top pattern is just a good way to understand the market is not as strong as all the buying makes it look like. The highs struggle to reach the maximum point of what’s “standard” for the market, which means it is not a strong market.\n\n    Aside from the basic bands, there are plenty of free scripts in the TradingView library that do variations of the default BBands or that will give you alerts based on different Bollinger bands strategies.\n  \n  \n    Divergences\n\n    As for oscillator divergences, Tradingview has free scripts that auto-paint the divs for you.\n\n    If you don’t want to use a black box, here’s a cheatsheet explaining all divergences.\n  \n\n\n4 - Market fundamentals to look at for market psychology\n\nBy fundamental tools I don’t mean on-chain in this case. When you look at onchain, you will usually see the situation is vaguely bullish, as long as there is lively activity in the network. That’s fine for long term investing but not very useful for trading.\n\nAnyway, I call them “market fundamentals” because these tools basically boil down to the fact that you cannot outsmart mathematics.\n\n\n\nFundamental tools for trading are metrics like open interest, margin funding prices and the pricing of futures and options.\n\n\n  High open interest on retail derivative markets usually indicates a lot of inconsiderate speculation.\n  High prices of fiat funding for spot margin markets are stifling for nascent bullish trends, because holding a position becomes too expensive. Just to clarify, if fiat funding is cheap, it does not mean the market will run up. It just means there is one bottleneck less.\n  Quarterly futures become cheaper than spot if the traders there mostly do not believe a bull trend will last, and vice versa.\n  High net worth players and funds will often show their opinions about the market by opening a massive hedge position on crypto option markets. You will know it’s probably a hedge rather than a speculation if the position is taken on an option with expiration date after 3 months or more.\n\n\nYou will not be able to consider these on most alt coin markets except ETH and a few other dinosaur alts. Vast majority of the thousands of alt coins in existence doesn’t even have derivative markets. If I had to guess, I’d say in small-cap alts you could probably use social media hype for “market fundamentals”.\n\nAs for open interest data, you can get it either as a separate chart or as an indicator in TradingView. The indicator version is useful if you like to put it to the bottom of your price chart. Futures premium is available for the bottom position as well.\n\nTools\n\nAs for options, CoinOptionsTrack is the general data source.\n\nFar easier to digest is the information you’ll get on Twitter from @DeribitInsights, though.\n\nAnd maybe read this post for 101 on how to read an option chart.\n",

      title: "NFT Games: What Are They and How Do Traders Make Money on Them?",
      content: "Crypto markets are taking a dive, but NFT fans are still ready to believe. NFT games are just a sub-niche, but just like it was with NFT art, some of the projects got absurd amounts of money poured into them.\n\nIn this article, we'll cover everything you need to know about NFT games and then we’ll how some people make money on them in 2022.\n\nThe obvious disclaimer: The fact that a crypto projects lures in copious amounts of retail or even corporate money does not say anything about its quality: Look at EOS. Hype exists, expectations get exaggerated, always do your own research.\n\nWhat is Play to Earn in Crypto?\n\nPlay-to-earn is a concept that allows players earn money directly through the game. Thanks to crypto, players get rewarded in the game token, which takes out any middlemen that would traditionally have to be present to pay gamers out.\n\nWhat Are NFT Games?\n\nSo, you probably stumbled upon the concept of NFTs. NFTs are an abbreviation for \"non-fungible tokens\", which essentially means they are unique, non-reproducible digital collectibles that are based on blockchain. They can have only one owner and can be traded in the same way physical works of art are traded.\n\nEver since blockchain technology started taking over the world, many talented developers have experimented with it, creating various cryptocurrencies, decentralised apps, NFTs and more. Some even had a brilliant idea: connecting cryptos and NFTs to the gaming industry. And the results were revolutionary.\n\nFinally, gamers had a chance to play games and earn assets that have real value. All games that have this type of approach are usually referred to as P2E (play-to-earn) games, and they typically revolve around the concept of NFTs.\n\nCutting out the middleman\n\nIt turns out that such a concept was perfect for the gaming industries, as game creators saw NFTs as an opportunity to create unique representations of characters, items, consumables and more. All of a sudden, in-game items received real-world value, and each game that revolves around this idea can be considered an NFT game.\n\nIs NFT Gaming the New Gold Mine?\n\nTo those who are willing to put in the time, it's a gold mine. It does require a lot of digging to get to the gold. Let us elaborate.\n\nWhen you use cryptocurrency as a type of investment, your goal is to wait for its price to go up, and then sell it to make a profit – correct?\n\nHowever, in NFT gaming, you're the one that can increase the price of your in-game asset. This is because your asset is non-fungible.\n\nImagine having a unique character and levelling them up by improving their skills. If someone wants to have a cool and strong character, they can buy it from you using real in-game cryptocurrency that you can later exchange for fiat money, or alternatively trade for other cryptocurrencies (or spend on other things in the game).\n\nYou'll basically have to work to improve the price of your asset, but it's not work per se – it's gaming, which is much more fun than work.\n\nIs there market for NFT game assets?\n\nAs long as the game retains some audience, your characters will always have value. You will be able to sell them to a player, as long as there are players.\n\nIf you know the game well, it’s also not difficult to see what attributes you need to build to increase your character’s value.\n\nThat’s why there is absolutely no wonder that NFT games are gaining in popularity much faster than NFT art:\n\n\n  In NFT art, traders need to hope their jpeg will enchant somebody.\n  They can’t change the artwork they purchased.\n  They can’t really know what attributes to look for in an artwork to make a killing either.\n\n\nArt is vague like that, but game characters aren’t.\n\nTypes of NFT Games\n\nPlease bear in mind that NFT gaming is a fairly new concept, so additional genres might appear in the future.\n\nFor now, there are three types of NFT games that are popular among players, so let's check them out.\n\n\n  \n    Play-To-Earn NFT Games\n\n    P2E NFT games are the most common type. You get to play the game and create a real-world value for your in-game assets.\n\n    Once they reach a certain value, you can sell them and make a profit.\n  \n  \n    Games for Players\n\n    This game type allows players to collect in-game items with value. These usually are weapons, vehicles or characters that are part of the gaming process. These items can be traded in the form of NFTs.\n  \n  \n    Free-to-Play Games\n\n    With these games, you do not have to make any initial investment to play. You can start playing for free and get rewarded with in-game assets in the process. The earnings in this type of game usually depend on randomised outcomes.\n  \n\n\nWhat Are the Best NFT Games to Play in 2022?\n\nLet's look at the NFT games that are currently considered the best (and the most popular).\n\n\n  \n    Axie Infinity\n\n    Developed by Sky Mavis from Vietnam, Axie Infinity is widely regarded as one of the best NFT games at the moment. It's based on Ethereum and uses two in-game cryptocurrencies to create an ecosystem.\n\n    Axie Infinity is technically a trading game, as players can collect, raise and breed virtual monsters called Axies. Each Axie is an NFT – it's unique and has a certain value. Of course, some Axies are more popular than others, and successful players can make a living breeding and trading Axies.\n\n    The other aspect of this game is battling, as players basically raise Axies to fight against other players.\n  \n  \n    Splinterlands\n\n    Splinterlands is very similar to Axie Infinity, but there is no raising or breeding. Instead, it's a trading-card game, with each card being a unique NFT. In other words, you can trade, collect and battle other players using your cards, and can earn money using the in-game cryptocurrency.\n\n    This game is still fairly new, but it connects the concept of trading cards and NFTs – which seems to be a match made in heaven, given that there are already cultures around the world revolving around buying and selling trading cards.\n  \n  \n    Decentraland\n\n    When you first load Decentraland, you'll enter a 3D virtual-reality (VR) world.\n\n    What makes Decentraland unique is that almost the entire world is player-made. There are thousands of parcels of land in the game, with each parcel being one NFT, meaning it's owned by a player.\n\n    You can think of it as a form of virtual real estate (or should it be called \"virtual real estate\"?).\n\n    The only difference is that you can use your creativity to build anything on your digital plot of land, which has resulted in some beautiful pieces of digital art and architecture.\n\n    Decentraland is the closest we come to the concept of the metaverse, but there's still a lot to incorporate to bring the metaverse to life.\n  \n  \n    The Sandbox\n\n    The Sandbox is pretty similar to Decentraland. It's an open-world blockchain-based title developed in 2012 by Pixowl, which was later acquired by Animoca Brands. This game allows users to monetise everything they create while playing and sell it for real money.\n\n    The Sandbox has already attracted plenty of investments and is one of the most successful blockchain games so far. It's so popular that some businesspeople, including Adrian Cheng, plan to build entire in-game worlds.\n  \n\n\nBottom Line\n\nTo sum up, NFT gaming is just around the corner, and there are already hundreds of thousands of people around the globe exploring NFT games, including the four mentioned in this guide.\n\nThe industry is still very young, but it's already competitive.\n\nOne thing is certain: the more people become part of the NFT-gaming community, the more money and time will be invested in these games and their NFTs. It means that now's not a bad time to consider incorporating this into your sources of income.\n",

      title: "Intro to risk budgeting and risk diversification (NOT hedging!)",
      content: "Are you tired of feeling like you’re always playing catch-up with the latest alt coin hype? Or are you the cautious type when it comes to investing? Do you stick to low-risk crypto assets, or do you dabble in low-cap alt coins?\n\nIf you’re looking for a way to keep your risk and improving your potential returns at the same time, it might help to consider risk diversification and risk budgeting.\n\nWhat is risk diversification (and what it isn’t)\n\nRisk diversification is a strategy that seeks to improve your risk-reward ratio by investing across a variety of different assets.\n\nRisk diversification is not strictly about lowering your risk, though: It is a technique that aims to maximize returns for a given level of risk.\n\nIt is used extensively in most forms of financial risk management. In 2022, that also includes the world of cryptocurrency.\n\nRisk diversification relies on the fact that not all risk factors are correlated with each other.\n\n\n  \n    Within your crypto portfolio, you can diversify your risk by spreading your investments between asset types that are starting to live their own lives.\n\n    That is: dinosaur cryptocurrencies, smaller volatile alt coins and any of the newer products (DeFi, NFT).\n\n    Note that for some long-term holders this part will actually increase to risk.\n  \n  \n    To further diversify the risk of your overall portfolio, add some non-crypto investment.\n\n    Spread your investments between stocks of companies of varying sizes, over different industries and over a range of geographic regions.\n\n    This element will lower the risk of your portfolio.\n  \n  \n    Neither point 1) nor point 2) aimed at creating a hedge for your portfolio.\n\n    As for risk hedging, think about a black swan type of event for which you’re offsetting the risk. Hedge is employed for a limited time only, to protect you from a catastrophic event.\n\n    The bad news is that hedge usually requires market timing. The alternative is a portfolio-wide stop loss, a common strategy on auto-trading platforms that you can set and forget. More on hedging a bit further down.\n  \n\n\nWhen to consider risk diversification\n\nYour crypto portfolio could possibly use risk diversification …\n\n\n  if you are over-exposing yourself to one particular area\n  if you are making subpar profits for your risk appetite (either through trading losses or through not risking enough)\n  … or both at once\n\n\nSince risk diversification is all about risk management, it needs to be used as a tool to help you achieve your goal of making risk-appropriate gains.\n\nYou may want to increase your total risk, too!\n\nExample: Same portfolio, different trader\n\nFor illustration, let’s taken an example portfolio of a crypto holder:\n\n  75% ETH\n  20% fiat\n  5% in ETH-based NFTs\n\n\nIs this an over-exposed portfolio? It is - there is no way around that.\n\nA basic way to find out whether your portfolio is over-exposed is to compare a chart showing your portfolio’s value with the charts of the assets you hold.\n\nIf you are over-exposed, the movement in your portfolio value will be following the value of one asset or one group of assets.\n\n\n  The example portfolio will be highly correlated with ETH. The NFT trading will make dents there, but not consistently enough. Also consider that since they are ETH NFTs, they are still somewhat correlated with ETH.\n\n\n“Over-exposed or not” is as far as objective thinking will take you.\n\nYou may be comfortable with the over-exposure, or you might not.\n\nThere’s no rule or table for that, it all depends on your risk tolerance.\n\nEnter Risk Budgeting\n\nThere is a risk management technique called “risk budgeting” which works with risk tolerance.\n\nIn risk budgeting, risk is based on volatility. You essentially rebalance your portfolio according to the size of the loss you are willing to take in a drawdown. Which, by the way, is a good habit to build, because you are evaluating your trading decisions with the risk-reward tradeoff in mind.\n\nLet’s return to the example portfolio - 75% ETH, 20% fiat and 5% ETH-based NFTs - and the possible risk budgeting scenarios different traders might consider.\n\n\n  \n    Not happy with returns: Too much money on the sidelines\n\n    AKA not enough risk in the risk budget. Some investors are aggressive and want to see the gains they feel are appropriate to being in crypto.\n\n    Here, the aggressive trader will be tempted allocate more of their portfolio into NFTs. NFTs are still super high-risk as the market is very young and not structured enough for any systematic speculation.\n\n    That’s OK for risk budgeting, but looking at it with risk diversification in mind, a better alternative may be to invest in DeFi alt coins instead or to get some high-leverage trading done.\n\n    This way the portfolio gains added risk, potential profit also increases, but at the same time the portfolio will not be too exposed to the whims of NFT shills.\n\n    \n  \n  \n    Happy with returns, not happy with risks: No limits to losses\n\n    Other investors would take comfort in knowing that in the “worst-case scenario”, their portfolio can only be down, say, 10% in its dollar value.\n\n    AKA, the risk is too high.\n\n    There is a few things you can do, and the easiest one of them is to set a portfolio-wide stop loss. Not to sell just yet - you still want those crypto-only gains - but to sell if the markets start dropping.\n\n    Shrimpy lets you do that automatically with no coding, as long as you hold your crypto in a wallet.\n\n    \n\n    Portfolio stop loss has a limitation though: If you are staking your crypto, you will need to use derivatives by way of a hedge, as the actual coin might not be available for you to sell when you need to.\n\n    The best way to do that at the moment is to set up triggers to open shorts in the FTX Quant Zone. The Quant Zone a quite a bit less user-friendly than Shrimpy.\n\n    \n  \n  \n    Happy with risks of crypto, but: Just too ETH-focused\n\n    A trader who is happy with the level of risk but not with the over-exposure to ETH obviously needs good old portfolio diversification.\n\n    The trick to diversify while keeping the level of risk roughly the same is in adding some assets that increase the overall risk as well as other assets that will lower it.\n\n    In the example portfolio, stocks or real estate would lower the risks and small alt coins would increase it. Depending on your successes there, your overall profits might increase.\n\n    If you don’t mind technical alt coin trading, you could set up a Coinrule bot for your low-cap alt coins to buy on some generic signal like RSI, and sell at 10% profit.\n\n    \n  \n  \n    Not quite happy, but also not willing to guess and speculate\n\n    Yet others may feel that hedging and rebalancing is equivalent to timing the market.\n\n    And that is out of the question as they want to focus the long term.\n\n    There are still ways to diversify risks without timing anything - more on that in the next section.\n  \n\n\nRisk diversification when you don’t want to speculate\n\nRisk diversification principles are pretty versatile.\n\nYou can still diversify risks even when there are too many unknowns and the risk factors keep changing: for example, during times of market turbulence.\n\nProfessional analysts usually find it difficult to estimate future risk in those times.\n\nBut you as an individual investor have the freedom to solve this problem in a lateral way: Investing in a business project or indeed starting your own business may do that.\n\nChoosing an unrelated industry for that will improve your risk diversification even better.\n\nEither way, this is a better way to risk diversify than by selling crypto to wait with fiat on the sidelines.\n\nThe difficulties with diversifying risk in crypto\n\nAs a final note, the difficulty with crypto risk management is not actually the correlation between alt coins.\n\nIt’s rather that there are so many risk factors involved with each crypto, and new risk factors are constantly being developed.\n\n\n  For example, the risk profile of Bitcoin changed when it became possible to trade BTC futures on unregulated exchanges with high leverage.\n  Some time after that, the risk factors changed again as institutional players entered the crypto markets.\n\n\nSome investors may decide that hedging risk is too expensive, either in terms of fees, time or opportunity costs. That is a valid decision. In this case, the reasonable thing to do is to research thoroughly and not invest more than you can survive losing.\n\nIf your problem with risk diversification is the time it consumes, try to automate your rebalancing and hedging, and use a stop loss. You won’t go broke taking profits.\n\n\n  Shrimpy (30% off from here!) specializes in portfolio management automation\n  Coinrule specializes in easy to automate technical trading\n\n\nBottom line\n\nRisk diversification is not just hedging or in other ways trying not to lose. It is about choosing which risk factors to invest in (such as small cryptocurrencies or NFTs) and which ones to pass.\n\nThis way you can capture much higher returns than by playing it safe, but by limiting your high risk investments to small part of your portfolio, making the wrong bet would not damage your net worth too much.\n",

      title: "Ethereum Classic: History, Fundamentals, 2022 Use Cases",
      content: "The currently known Ethereum blockchain is actually a 2016 fork of the original ledger.\n\nSince 2016, Ethereum Classic is the name of the continuation of the original Ethereum blockchain - the classic version preserving untampered history; free from external interference and rollbacks of transactions.\n\nWhat does Ethereum Classic bring to the table?\n\nOn the official website, ethereumclassic.org, the developers state that ETC is one of the purest and most decentralized blochchains out there.\n\nEthereum Classic provides a decentralized Turing-complete virtual machine, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (or \"EVM\"). This is the same feature as ETH has.\n\n\n  The Ethereum virtual machine can execute complex scripts known as “smart contracts” using an international network of public nodes.\n  The EVM also allows for peer-to-peer value exchange and permits users to create any type of application on top of it: financial derivatives, voting systems, auctions, lotteries, etc.\n\n\nThe success, as well as failure points in its history, are discussed below:\n\n2016: The Ether Fork\n\nIn July 2016, the original ETH blockchain went through the demise of the first ever DAO. Because some people believed that the DAO was not programmed correctly and had too many vulnerabilities, an attacker exploited one of these vulnerabilities and took 3.6 million ether from the DAO (at the time, around $50 million).\n\nWhile some members of the Ethereum community argued for a hard fork in order to return the stolen funds to their owners, others believed that this would violate the core principles of Ethereum - the immutability of blockchain.\n\nThis group went with what is now known as Ethereum Classic (ETC). After a brief time of uncertainty, ETC emerged as the minor cryptocurrency and an alt coin, while the forked chain that removed the DAO hack from history went on to be accepted as ETH.\n\nETC developers maintain a different view of the DAO hack\n\nThe developers who carried on to form around Ethereum Classic argued that the DAO hack was not due to a flaw in the Ethereum code, but rather a general weakness in smart contract coding.\n\nIn their view, any hard fork due to a smart contract hack would have set a bad precedent and could compromise the future of the cryptocurrency.\n\nIn their opinion, it will always be easy for a skilful hacker to steal funds from smart contracts and Dapps in general. Therefore it makes sense not to set the precedent of rolling back the whole ledger as people will come to require that again in the future and it undermines the decentralized nature of cryptocurrency.\n\nEthereum Classic nowadays\n\nEthereum Classic continues to be led by its original development team and is intended to be a platform for smart contracts and decentralized applications (Dapps).\n\nSince going independent, Ethereum Classic has faced a few challenges.\n\nFor one, because it is a continuation of the original blockchain, it does not have the same level of support from exchanges and wallets as Ethereum.\n\nSecondly, its mining difficulty has increased significantly, making it more difficult to mint new ETC.\n\nFinally, its price has been much more volatile than Ethereum.\n\nETC benefited from rising ETH fees\n\nDespite these challenges, Ethereum Classic is still actively traded and used. ETC has been added to a number of exchanges, including the major ones like Binance and Coinbase.\n\nThere are now over 100 Dapps built on the platform, and its use cases do not stop there.\n\nNow there are even online casinos which let you play online casino games using Ethereum classic, which makes it easier and safer for the casino player. Casinos online are online games of chance, and online casinos on ethereum classic are no different, except that take bets with cryptocurrencies like Ethereum Classic (ETC).\n\nSome NFT art creators have likewise started creating digital art on Ethereum Classic, leveraging the fact that NFTs on ETC are still rare which makes it easier to stand out.\n\nThis development speaks about the popularity of ETC that, at least for a time, benefited from the 2021 exorbitant transaction fees on the ETH chain.\n\nSome Platforms Adopted Ethereum Classic for Lower-Fee Payments\n\nA recent example from another industry - the music industry - is VOISE, a decentralized music platform that allows artists to release their music and receive payments in Ethereum Classic.\n\nThe platform uses the blockchain to streamline the music industry and cut out the middleman. Artists can use VOISE to upload their music, set prices, and receive payments directly from fans.\n\nThe VOISE platform is just one example of how Ethereum Classic can be used to revolutionize various industries. As the platform continues to grow and develop, more and more businesses will adopt it as their preferred blockchain solution. For those looking for a secure and censorship-resistant option, Ethereum Classic is well worth considering.\n\nBottom Line\n\nEthereum Classic continues to be a viable alternative to Ethereum and in 2021 has continued to grow in popularity.\n\n\n  For those who believe in the original principles of Ethereum, it is a more secure and censorship-resistant option.\n  For those who are comfortable using Ethereum but less so with its transaction fees, ETC likewise presents a good option.\n\n\nIt is also still in development, meaning that its features and capabilities are constantly evolving. For these reasons, Ethereum Classic is worth keeping an eye on.\n\nThe future of Ethereum Classic is yet to be determined. While it has made significant headway and continues to add Dapps and features, it still faces challenges related to adoption and volatility.\n\nThis positive support is also growing in some business models which start to use Ethereum Classic for payments or deposits.\n",

      title: "Ethereum Fundamentals Recap: List of 2021 events and their impact on price",
      content: "Cryptocurrency markets have made a rapid rally following a series of violent price crashes in May and June 2021.\n\nThe so-called dinosaur cryptos, Bitcoin and Ethereum, as the two dominant market movers pushed up other cryptos along with themselves after bottoming out by July-end.\n\nThis is to recap the most important fundamental changes on the Ethereum markets in 2021 and their impact on the markets.\n\nIn spring 2021, the narrative was at Ethereum gas fees\n\n\n\nBack in May 2021, Ethereum started to crash from its all-time high price of $4,500 per coin after its network had gotten severely congested and transaction (gas) fees had exploded skywards.\n\nThis was followed by large, long-term Ethereum holders taking substantial profits from their Ethereum holdings.\n\nThat information comes from onchain data, as Ethereum runs on a public blockchain just like Bitcoin. There were long-term holders selling in spring 2021, but it’s possible that they were just befitting the typical \"sell in May and go away\" tradition in crypto and tradfi markets.\n\nDuring these sell-offs, Ethereum fell as low as $1,700 per coin as of July 20, 2021.\n\nHowever, for a little time only, it stayed at those low prices, as we could observe on CEX.IO.\n\nEthereum London Hard Fork (EIP-1559)\n\nOn August 5, Ethereum launched its \"London\" hard fork, which in practice is a technical upgrade on its network. This particular upgrade was called the EIP-1559.\n\nBefore the EIP-1559 upgrade, all of the gas fees in the Ethereum network used to be paid to miners as a return for validating transactions in the network. During times of high traffic however, this leads to people outbidding each other to get their transaction through, and in turn to the well known exorbitant transaction costs.\n\nTo disincentivize the outbidding activity, gas fees are now burned and removed from the circulating Ethereum supply with the launch of EIP-1559.\n\nGas fees being removed from Ethereum's supply has, in return, started to create a shortage of liquidity in Ethereum markets. In fact, the upgrade removed an increasing amount of Ethereum supply from circulation due to the network being used more and more every day. This has led to the burning of more than 1 million Ethers in only 3 months, since August 2021.\n\nThe shrink in supply has caused a deflationary pressure and contributed to the price of Ethereum rallying upwards. The surge was additionally assisted by the rally in Bitcoin throughout August, with which Ethereum has been known to be strongly correlated throughout its market history.\n\nEthereum managed to move back to its May high in a matter of only 45 days after making its $1,700 low on July 20, 2021. Bitcoin bounced from $30,000 to $53,000 during the same period.\n\n\n\nEthereum Altair Upgrade\n\nFollowing a brief consolidation period throughout September, a new catalyst for Ethereum came in October 2021 - the Altair upgrade.\n\nAltair was an update for Ethereum 2.0's new blockchain that runs on a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. You may already know of it even if you’re not up to date with ETH news: Ethereum 2.0 is among the highest paying alt coins for cold staking.\n\nAltair brought a number of improvements in the operation of this new blockchain, which is expected to expedite the migration process of the existing PoW Ethereum blockchain to its new 2.0 PoS counterpart.\n\nThis development helped Ethereum propel to a new all-time high price at $4,800 on November 10, 2021.\n\nSince that day, all eyes have been on the developments in the crypto ecosystem in an effort to understand whether the market still has juice for further upside price action.\n\nEthereum On-Chain Activity in 2021 Grew Substantially\n\nIn terms of Ethereum, although the on-chain activity has cooled off a bit since the Altair update, holders are still showing strong signs of accumulation as the number of prospective ETH 2.0 validators keep growing and coins are leaving exchanges at an accelerated rate.\n\nMonitoring on-chain activity is useful to understand the supply and demand dynamics of a cryptocurrency asset. When the number of illiquid coins in a network increases, it decreases the circulating supply, which likely ends up with a surge in coin price.\n\nThe number of prospective Ethereum 2.0 validators has increased by over 10% since the July lows (from 105K to 120K).\n\nETH 2.0 has a minimum locked amount for validator nodes. A validator needs to have at least 32 Ethers and stake them to qualify, which means at least 480,000 Ethers have become illiquid since the summer of 2021.\n\nIn addition, the total number of Ethereum coins locked in the smart contracts of Ethereum-based applications (dApps) reached an all-time high of 28% by the end of October 2021. This means 28% of the entire Ethereum supply is illiquid, not in circulation and not to be sold.\n\nA higher number of Ethereum being passively held in wallets and locked in smart contracts adds to the growing supply shortage.\n\nEthereum balances in cryptocurrency exchanges further support this picture.\n\nThroughout 2021, there was a 25% drop in the Ethereum balance of cryptocurrency exchanges, which have been transferred to wallets (either for cold staking or for holding) and into smart contracts (for defi staking).\n\nAll these factors signal that the big money is still in an accumulation phase for Ethereum.\n\nOf course, Bitcoin's next-round price action is still a key for the path of Ethereum, but as long as the big money does not sell a significant volume of their long-term Bitcoin holdings, Ethereum's fundamentals suggest that it is poised for another run in the coming months.\n\nWhat Could Be Ahead for Ethereum?\n\nBitcoin is meant as a form of payment, Ethereum has utilitarian goals that could grow into a number of industries.\n\n\n  As we all know, Ethereum has smart contract functionality. In 2021, smart contracts have blown up into endless opportunities in the areas of finance and media, such as decentralized finance (DeFi), and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n  While Ethereum has a lot of competitors, it still constitutes the only truly decentralized blockchain other than Bitcoin.\n  The utility role of Ethereum could strenghten its position. Even if cryptocurrencies do not replace the traditional currencies that we use, Ethereum can still survive and keep growing due to its decentralized smart contract capability.\n\n\nEthereum is an open-source blockchain, which means anyone can create a new smart contract or an application that consists of multiple smart contracts on the Ethereum network.\n\nIn that sense, Ethereum's potential is limited only by the creativity of developers.\n\nWhile no one knows how far Ethereum can become part of our daily lives, a large number of people believe that if today's internet is Web 2.0, Ethereum and all its decentralized applications could become Web 3.0 in the future.\n\nWhile Bitcoin is still the alpha cryptocurrency that drags the market along with itself, Ethereum has numerous technology advantages over Bitcoin. However, there is never any guarantee when investing in cryptocurrency.\n",

      title: "NFT Platforms: Where is the value on NFT Marketplaces?",
      content: "Non-fungible tokens might seem like a passing fad, but with over $15 billion traded in 2021, it's clear that this blockchain-based tool for monetising digital content is transforming into a big industry.\n\nFollowing the auction of Beeple's tokenized digital artwork that sold for $69.3 million at Christie's auction house, firms and individual creators have begun exploring ways to use NFTs.\n\nEven traditional art brokers are now exploring cryptocurrency, with sites like https://www.cryptovantage.com/ providing  the information they need to understand decentralized finance.\n\nThe popularity of blockchain-based digital artworks doesn't show any signs of slowing down and NFT marketplaces have likewise boomed.\n\nNFT Marketplaces\n\nSome NFT art creators have tried building their own marketplaces, but most creators have found it more feasible to partner with larger, already established platforms.\n\nThird-party NFT platforms reduce upfront costs, give the creators access to a larger customer base and offer valuable add-on services like legal and technical support.\n\nWhat's an NFT Marketplace?\n\nAn NFT marketplace is a digital platform that connects art collectors, brokers and investors with NFT creators.\n\nThese platforms are continually trying to differentiate each other, with some appealing to gamers' aesthetics, while others are about fine art.\n\nWhile you don't need a middleman to trade NFT art, at this stage, partnering with an NFT marketplace is becoming essential. The market is getting crowded and unless the creator already has a loyal audience of their own, they will need to gain exposure through an NFT platform.\n\nTypes of NFT Marketplaces\n\nNFT marketplaces are divided into two main categories – open markets and closed marketplaces.\n\n\n  Open markets are free for anyone to join.\n  Closed marketplaces (sometimes also called premium) only allow creators to register on the invitation.\n\n\nThe value of the art you can get at either of them in general differs.\n\nOpen Markets for NFT art\n\nWhile open markets are free to join, they're known to have fewer premium values than closed platforms.\n\nHowever, every creator goes through the minting and listing process, before building their careers as NFT creators to get an invitation to closed platforms. Here are popular open NFT marketplaces online:\n\n\n  \n    Opensea - https://opensea.io\n\n    \n\n    Opensea is the oldest and currently the leading NFT marketplace.\n\n    It was launched in 2017 and boasts the highest number of registered artists. The platform supports various NFT formats, including video, images, 3D, and other types of physical and non-physical assets.\n\n    While Opensea charges a lot of gas fees for your first contract, creators are not charged more gas fees on their consecutive NFT minting. That makes the platform relatively friendly to artists compared to other pricing systems, only taking 2.5% of the sales value as their commission.\n\n    The only negative side of Opensea is that each NFT listings gets less engagement compared to closed communities due to the high number of registered users. So, the audience at NFT is larger, but the amount of art to choose from too, which dilutes the engagement.\n\n    However, users on the platform can search NFTs by keywords to discover your work from the millions of listings available. That makes Opensea among the best choices for creators who can promote their works on social media or other platforms.\n  \n  \n    Rarible - https://rarible.com\n\n    \n\n    While Rarible only came to life in 2020, it's also among the most reliable NFT marketplaces online.\n\n    Rarible allows artists to NFT on the original token known as \"RARI\" and ERC721, supporting images, audio, and video.\n\n    The defining feature of Rarible is the use of their original token (RARI), which can be used to buy or sell NFTs on the platform. The token also allows users to vote or propose improvements, curate featured artwork, moderate community members, and propose community grants. That means it functions like a virtual stock that involves the users in platform management.\n\n    Like Opensea, Rarible charges a gas fee for the initial contract. You'll also be paying for minting and listing fees every time you try to sell your works, which explains why Rarible artists often lament over finance.\n\n    However, with their 2.5% service fee, Rarible is still very popular as a user interface, useful to both creators and collectors.\n  \n\n\nClosed Marketplaces for NFT art\n\nFor artists who have done well trading in open marketplaces and are ready to move forward, here are the best premium (closed) marketplaces to join.\n\n\n  \n    Foundation https://foundation.app (Promote your NFT art on Twitter for invite code)\n\n    \n\n    Foundation is arguably the most populated and best accessible closed NFT marketplace.\n\n    The platform was officially launched in 2021 and rapidly grew in popularity to host thousands of creators. The invite codes are mostly given away on Twitter to unique NFT artists that are rising in popularity. An invite code can occasionally be traded for non-fungible tokens or money too, though.\n\n    The main advantage of being a Foundation creator is in its reputation. NFT art collectors know that the platform only hosts works that deserve a high value.\n\n    However, the Foundation’s 15% sales commission is larger than most marketplaces and their gas fees are also remarkably high.\n\n    Additionally, the platform only supports PNG, MP4, and JPG, but Audio, 3D, and AR are coming soon.\n  \n  \n    Makersplace https://makersplace.com (Submit portfolio to get invitation)\n\n    \n\n    Makersplace is a premium NFT marketplace that is less accessible than Foundation.\n\n    Unlike Foundation, Makersplace isn't based on community invitation. Instead, creators can join the platform by submitting their portfolio and profile as an audition and they can get an official invitation after passing.\n\n    The audition process is relatively smooth, but you might have to wait for a few months as there is an increasing amount of interest.\n\n    Thankfully, the fee structure at Makersplace is a little more favorable than Foundation. Creators only pay the gas fees once per minting and their sales commission stands at 15%.\n\n    Makersplace also supports more file formats, including JPEG, PNG, TIFF, GIF, and MP4.\n  \n\n\nBottom Line\n\nOpen marketplaces get more of both NFT art and visitors, which lowers the amount of attention per artwork. Premium marketplaces list high-value NFT art, which is convenient for art collectors who are willing to pay premium.\n\nFor NFT traders and art brokers, a value opportunity can be found on open marketplaces, if they manage to find an upcoming artist who ends up gaining in popularity later.\n",

      title: "5 Questions To Ask Yourself Before Investing In NFTs",
      content: "Collins Dictionary recently declared the term 'non-fungible token' (NFT) as 2021's word of the year after recording a staggering 11,000% increase in its use in conversations and other media.\n\nFrom financial articles to social media, the prevalence of NFTs in discussions says a lot about the digital currency market and where it's headed. (1)\n\nThanks to NFTs, any drawing, Tweet, or even meme template can be worth millions of dollars.\n\nThis reason alone has people putting their hard-earned money into this new yet high-risk investment.\n\nHowever, anyone wanting to make it big in this market needs to ask themselves some hard questions, like the following:\n\n\n  \n    Do I know what NFTs are?\n\n    A prominent figure once stressed that there could be no compromise when it comes to learning the basics. As such, the journey to NFT success should begin with understanding what it means and how investors can turn it into a lucrative opportunity.\n\n    NFTs are a type of digital currency tied to a specific medium, be it an illustration or text. The keyword here is 'non-fungible,' meaning it's unique to that medium and irreplaceable, unlike other digital currencies like tradeable cryptos.\n\n    In a way, the nature of NFTs helped manage a problem plaguing artists and other intellectual property (IP) owners. Even with duplicates making rounds on the internet, NFTs enable them to confirm their works as the original. Anyone can make the same Tweet as Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey did in 2006, but only his Tweet—the first of its kind—can sell for USD$2.9 million.\n\n    Given how it has dominated online discussions, NFT basics are abundant in websites such as NFT Club and others. Aside from talking about how NFT works, these sources also detail tips and tricks in buying NFTs and choosing the right marketplaces.\n  \n  \n    Do I have a good reason to invest in NFTs?\n\n    This next question doesn't necessarily talk about the advantages of investing in NFTs, like their uniqueness among one another. Instead, it focuses on the reasons to consider putting thousands or millions on original art and media.\n\n    Experts point at two reasons, the first being the satisfaction of owning such works. Avid fans will go to great lengths to obtain something significant, if not irreplaceable, from various IPs. Buying NFTs grants them ownership rights to that particular work.\n\n    The second is the crypto market's continued boom, specifically the rise in the value of Ethereum. Despite some price drops, Ethereum has been on the rise this year––from USD$730.97 at the start of the year to over USD$4,000 this November. Coupled with the COVID pandemic and falling confidence in the U.S. dollar, NFTs are sending people on an investment frenzy. (2)(3)\n\n    It's also worth noting that millennials are driving this significant shift in investing due to holding more purchasing power than other generations. These investors have money to lose and can risk investing in decentralized markets, though this shouldn't make them less cautious.\n  \n  \n    Does buying NFTs make the work mine?\n\n    Since NFTs are concerned with buying rights to a specific work, this question should be on any investor's mind. While they grant ownership rights to the buyer, NFTs don't give rights to distribution and reproduction. In other words, anyone who buys original media through NFTs shouldn't expect to be named the copyright owner.\n\n    Copyright law guarantees copyright owners' rights to their works, even after selling them via NFTs. As mentioned earlier, NFTs only serve to confirm art or media as original among the duplicates and derivatives circulating on the internet. The same law also mandates that only the owner has the authority to turn their works into NFTs. (4)\n  \n  \n    Will NFTs retain their value in the long run?\n\n    NFTs may be the talk of the town, but it doesn't necessarily make them good—at least the way it is now. One industry expert believes that the current market is within a 'bubble' similar to the dot-com tech boom that defined the late 1990s. The more people invest in NFTs, the bigger the bubble gets and the greater the risk of popping.\n\n    Ironically, according to experts, the same technology that gives NFTs their advantages also has its disadvantages. Apart from NFTs not granting absolute ownership over a medium, below are other risks explained.\n\n    ◼ Being Ethereum-based makes NFTs decentralized currency, meaning no third party (let alone a regulatory body) overseeing the market. The values are highly speculatory, unlike physical money that bases its value on gold.\n\n    ◼ Anyone can make their own NFTs out of anything, which presents the risk of fraudulent NFTs and markets. More often than not, such activities would sell art and media without consent from their creators, a clear breach of copyright law.\n\n    ◼ NFTs aren't known for their liquidity, as selling them requires looking for someone who would pay top dollar for a collectible. An investor who paid for six figures in an NFT might suffer if the market value suddenly nosedives.\n\n    ◼ Lawmakers in countries like the U.S., the U.K., and Japan have yet to classify NFTs in a specific manner. Without this, they can't formulate a legal framework to protect investors if the market goes south. (5)\n  \n  \n    How much can I afford to lose?\n\n    If you're still adamant about investing in NFTs despite the pros and cons, this last question will matter. As with any big-ticket investment, it pays to ask how much you can afford to invest.\n\n    Experts highly advise against putting every dollar in high-risk investments like NFTs; they suggest spreading capital over different (and much safer) ones. Placing the bulk of your money on safe investments will ensure financial security regardless of the direction the NFT market heads. That way, even if NFTs tank, you'll still earn when other assets increase.\n  \n\n\nBottom line\n\nNFTs may be a buzzword in today's economy, but they're relatively new and lack essential protective measures. Thanks to being at the heart of financial discussions and the influx of professionals to manage the market, NFTs will eventually get better. Until then, asking these hard questions and doing due diligence are any NFT investor's best means of protection.\n\nReferences\n\n1 \"NFT or non-fungible token is Collins Dictionary's word of the year\", Source: https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-59401046\n\n2 \"Ethereum price\", Source: https://www.coinbase.com/price/ethereum\n\n3 \"We talked to crypto-art investors to figure out what's driving people to spend millions on NFTs, despite no guarantee their value will increase\", Source: https://www.businessinsider.com/why-are-people-buying-nfts-investing-in-nft-crypto-art-2021-3\n\n4 \"What are the copyright implications of NFTs?\" Source: https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/what-are-copyright-implications-nfts-2021-10-29/\n\n5 \"Non-fungible Tokens: bubble or future?\" Source: https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/21162/non-fungible-tokens-bubble-or-future\n",

      title: "How Crypto Trading Affects Your Mental Health (Positive and Negative Effects)",
      content: "A timely post for once, isn’t it?\n\nWe all know that trading has a negative effect on mental health for so many traders. And it doesn’t have to be crypto: Markets have been cornered way, way before crypto was even a gleam in Satoshi Nakamoto’s eye and there was always plenty of people on the wrong side of the trade.\n\nSo, trading is a stressful, competitive and cut-throat endeavour. You have to be able to handle the highs and lows of the markets in order to succeed.\n\nBut believe it or not, trading doesn’t have to be something that will make your life miserable.\n\nIf you’re miserable, quit\n\nIf the last sentence describes how you feel though, by all means, stop trading. There are easier ways to make money and keep them. Seriously.\n\nIn this blog post we’ll discuss some of the effects - bad and good - that trading can have on your psychology and mental well-being, so that hopefully the traders who enjoy trading can continue to develop their skills with no more setbacks than what’s necessary.\n\nCan trading have good effects on your mental health?\n\nOne of the most asked questions Google will suggest to you on the topic of trading and mental health is How to overcome fear in trading.\n\nIndeed, controlling fear and emotional responses in trading is a big issue. I personally think nobody can really teach you that. The matters of psychology are too individual for that.\n\nBut let’s first look at this fear that traders get. You’ll have to do some soul searching to figure this one out for yourself, but for the sakes of this post let me just make a blanket statement: In many cases it’s actually an adrenaline rush, not fear, what traders get.\n\nA pretty normal response. Some people are wired so that it makes them happy, others will freak out; in any case it is not difficult to learn to control an adrenaline rush.\n\nWhy is this in under a headline talking about the positive effects of trading on mental health?\n\nControlled exposure to adrenaline is healthier than you think\n\nWhile the term “mental health epidemic” has been well contested, psychiatrists still seem to agree that there has been an upsurge in mental health issues, especially in all sorts of trauma-related ones.\n\nThe standard treatment nowadays are coping strategies, which is something like a lame sister of affirmations, and then meds of course. Some psychiatrists criticise that and propose what is basically a systematic exposure to stress, anxiety and adrenaline. There seems to be some neurological research to back that up.\n\nAccording to Judith Herman, M.D., author of Trauma and Recovery: The Aftermath of Violence from Domestic Abuse to Political Terror, this practice teaches people to analyse their experience with adrenaline first, before freaking out.\n\nHere’s your Bitcoin killer app, I think.\n\nYou still need a trading strategy though\n\nLet’s now go through some of the more practical tips.\n\nControlling an adrenaline rush doesn’t mean erasing it. It means you just carry on doing whatever you planned to do, aware that you are also having an adrenaline rush.\n\nIt’s whatever you planned to do, let’s repeat it for the people in the back. If you do not have at least a super basic plan, adrenaline is not going to help you.\n\n\n  \n    Risk management\n\n    Risk management is a practice through which you try to reduce the amount of risk in your trading by setting up rules for yourself when trading.\n\n    A good rule is the one that says nobody ever went broke by taking profits. It is better to take profits too early than too late. Nobody has the crystal ball, at best you can be fairly confident that you are right. It makes sense to “price” the alternative of actually being wrong.\n\n    \n      Close positions by 10% or 20% based on your targets. You can use this sort of plan even when you just DCA and hodl.\n      Sell the altcoins that start to perform worse than the rest of the market - more in Market Timing Strategy.\n      Use stops. You can use them as a functional part of your trading - more in Scalping Strategy.\n    \n  \n  \n    Take a break regularly\n\n    There are ways day trading can make your mental health worse. The constant stress of the markets, even for those who are good at controlling their emotions, can cause problems with anxiety. A steady trader must learn to control their emotions, which isn’t possible without proper rest. Skipping rest eventually leads to burnout.\n\n    There are a few things you can do to avoid burnout in trading. You can start by being aware of your responsibility for your profits. If you have a losing streak, remind yourself that it’s not because the markets are rigged against you, but rather because you’re missing some key information.\n\n    \n      What is it that you didn’t consider?\n      And what are the things you did consider but chose to ignore?\n    \n\n    This will give you the motivation needed to try new strategies and make changes to your trading habits.\n  \n  \n    Do not make trading more emotional than it has to be\n\n    A person must learn to control their emotions when it comes to financial decisions because overreacting could cost a lot of money that in the worst case he doesn’t even have.\n\n    The following are three major things that keep you organized in a way to help your control your emotions when trading:\n\n    \n      Reviewing your trades before you go to sleep for the evening. Using a trading log is a good idea. It can be a simple Google Spreadsheet.\n      Have a dedicated block of time for analysis. Look at the charts, read the news, skim the message boards, make notes. Don’t just do that whenever you feel like procrastinating.\n      Identifying emotional triggers at their source. For example, if watching the market all day makes you feel anxious, stop watching it! Submit your orders and go do something else.\n      Allowing yourself time off from trading when you feel like your emotions are getting out of control.\n    \n  \n  \n    It’s just trading\n\n    When you’re having a bad day trading, remember that it’s just trading. It’s not your life. You can always come back tomorrow and try again. The markets are not going anywhere.\n  \n\n\nBottom Line\n\nYou may have been asking yourself if trading is bad for mental health. There is no simple answer. But it is safe to say that well-handled crypto trading has more psychological benefits than it has drawbacks.\n\nIt is likewise safe to say that it does take discipline to trade successfully though. Disregarding at least rudimentary risk management is a sure way to fail.\n",

      title: "Why are millennials into cryptocurrencies and trading?",
      content: "Millennials are responsible for driving a mass shift in the investing industry.\n\nGone are the days of them being backseat drivers; time has put them behind the wheel and has millennials determining the direction of the industry.\n\nMillennials have brought some of the most significant changes in the stock trading and investing industry, with companies like RobinHood leading the way to change.\n\nCryptocurrency Markets as The Poster Child\n\nThe shift in the way people invest is no more evident than in cryptocurrencies; millennials have taken crypto to new heights.\n\nWhile most gen Xers and boomers saw crypto as nothing more than a passing fad, the dedication, and work that millennials have put into cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum has made it clear that cryptocurrencies are here to stay.\n\nMillennials currently hold more purchasing power than any other generation. This power, coupled with the highest investment knowledge of any generation before them, makes their influence over the investment industry undeniable.\n\nMillennials and Investing\n\n\n\nThe Covid pandemic has seen Millennials uphold some of their leading points of view, at least in terms of their approach to financial decisions:\n\n\n  \n    Increased Cryptocurrency Investments\n\n    In the past two years, the value of some younger cryptocurrencies and DeFi tokens has increased by over ten times their original values.\n\n    Even with established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum rising by six times in the past year, millennials' investments have shown their power to drive healthy investments.\n  \n  \n    MEME Stocks\n\n    \"Meme stocks\" are those of companies that faced heavy shorts from powerful Wall Street shops.\n\n    Still, due to a crowd of ambitious Millennial Redditors, these companies saw a short but profitable jump in share prices that gave many a hedge fund a headache.\n\n    You might not agree with their ethos and execution. Still, the ability to get coordinated on an anonymous message board where anyone can easily lie, and to coordinate without a leader, deserves to be praised.\n  \n  \n    Blockchain Tech Boost\n\n    Millennials played a massive role in driving the rise of decentralized finance that uses blockchain technology to evolve business practices. The Millennial purchase power has been cited as the main reason for blockchain's success.\n  \n  \n    NFT Pioneers\n\n    Millennials are responsible for creating and selling non-fungible tokens (NFTs), with the NFT industry skyrocketing to over $2 billion in value in the first six months of 2021.\n  \n\n\nMillennials and Cryptocurrency\n\nWhile Millennials have shown interest in all forms of investing, cryptocurrency is by far the industry of choice for them. The activity displayed by Millennials is clear as day to those who look at companies founded and supported by this generation.\n\nShortly after going public, Coinbase's value rose to close to $50 billion due to the swarm of new investors, most of whom are Millennials.\n\nRobinhood, which boasts an average user age of 31yrs old, saw an early valuation of over $30 billion, not just for its stock investments but mainly for its dealings with cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin and Bitcoin.\n\nWhy Millennials Love Cryptocurrency\n\n\n\nThere is no doubt that Millennials have fallen in love with cryptocurrencies. With no foreseeable end to this relationship coming, new cryptocurrency exchanges are popping up every month. Here are just a few reasons why Millennials are crazy about crypto:\n\n\n  \n    Massive Potential\n\n    Millennials have taken notice of cryptocurrencies' undeniably higher yields when compared to traditional stocks. (Higher yields are not always higher yields on cost though.)\n\n    While benchmark indices have only seen a rise in the region of 20%, some digital currencies have grown by a whopping 500%. With new crypto options regularly available, getting in on early and cheap buy-ins is an attractive prospect.\n\n    One needs to look at Bitcoin's initial value and compare that to the present to see why purchasing new cryptocurrencies is a worth risk; returns on even the most minor investment could be life-changing.\n  \n  \n    Pandemic Relief\n\n    With the pandemic costing many Millennials their jobs, liquidity increased, and banks provided more loans to people, there was a sharp increase in the number of people investing in cryptocurrencies as a potentially high return way to supplement a now reduced income.\n\n    NFT games like Axie Infinity have created an income opportunity that anyone with a mobile phone can take advantage of. These games have led to thousands of Millennials deciding not to return to work as things return to normal. Instead, they earn a better living from home thanks to blockchain and crypto.\n  \n  \n    Social Influence\n\n    Social media is flooded with cryptocurrency influencers posting video tutorials on how to get started.\n\n    There are also tons of success stories that seem too good to be true; the difference with these crypto stories is that most are true. A growing number of people in their early 30's becoming millionaires thanks to cryptocurrencies, while their “smarter” peers are rotting away trying to make it in corporate.\n\n    With the news of this spreading on social feeds, Millennials feel like there is no better time than the present to get into crypto trading.\n  \n  \n    Future of Finance\n\n    Blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies are creating a decentralized financial landscape. This landscape offers many new apps that make getting a loan or using crypto collateral a reality. Millennials understand that this decentralization is the future of finance.\n\n    If you look back ten years, it was impossible to earn a living by playing a game on your mobile phone, but thanks to cryptocurrencies, that is now not only a possibility, it is also relatively easy to get started. The market is flooded with new NFT games with cheap buy-ins and high potential returns for those willing to take a chance.\n  \n  \n    Simple Processing\n\n    Using cryptocurrency for payments is simpler than ever before; it is also easier to start investing and earning yield and interests from crypto than it is to open a traditional bank account.\n\n    Companies like Skrill and PayPal understand the demand for fast transactions and have built their business simply on catering to Millennials' need for speed.\n\n    But traditional investing and trading has not innovated yet, and stock picking and waiting ages for the right time to sell do not meet Millennials' expectations.\n  \n\n\nBottom Line\n\nMillennials' love for cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology, NFTs, and other digital currency is clearly not a fleeting feeling.\n\nThe success of top cryptocurrency trading apps during an otherwise financially dire time of pandemic is clear evidence of Millennial purchasing power and the ability to drive change.\n\nWith the growing cryptocurrency market and more Millennials acquiring the knowledge and financial ability to invest, this generation's future of finance is being shaped.\n",

      title: "Volume profile trading on TradingView - ScriptSpotlight",
      content: "This article uses free pine scripts from TradingView - sign up now and maybe go PRO on Black Friday?\n\nVolume profile trading is one of the popular, but tricky trading styles. It’s also expensive: It needs large amount of market data and that’s not usually what charting apps want to give away for free.\n\nVolume profile definition\n\nVolume profile is a histogram that shows volume traded by price level.\n\nA popular indicator is VPVR, or volume profile visible range, which re-paints your volume histogram as you move through the chart back in time.\n\nThere are other ways to do volume profiles too, such as showing a histogram for each trading day.\n\nTradingview’s Volume Profile Indicators\n\nTradingView has several free alternatives in the public library. It is worth noting that all of them are estimates - they do not work with the exact live volume data on the market and so they will not be 100% accurate.\n\nMost often, TradingView volume profile scripts will give you a single histogram for a selected time range. That is the so-called volume profile fixed range. It is easy to read but accumulates back in time.\n\nSo, unless you make notes into your chart, you will never be able to see the exact volume profile as it appeared let’s say last Monday. When checking volumes back in time, you will only get the histogram of the full timespan between now and last Monday.\n\nThat may be a deal-breaker, depending on your habits and style of trading. On the other hand, the only other option right now is volume blocks - one volume profile histogram per trading day.\n\nThat may or may not make sense in crypto, as crypto markets trade 24/7 and there are several hi-volume sessions that coincide roughly with certain times of the day in Beijing, London and New York.\n\nCryptowatch has Volume Profile for visible chart range\n\n…And so this is the first moment in the history of crypto trading where Cryptowatch delivers where TradingView is failing, and not the other way around.\n\nAnyway, Cryptowatch in the website version has volume profile that (swiftly!) recalculates for your visible chart range.\n\nThe full range of technical analysis tools on Cryptowatch is still very limited, but if you want to trade volume profile for free, you will most likely need to check back with a Cryptowatch chart, at the very least.\n\nTrading with Volume Profile\n\n\n\nThere are a bunch of “volume profile” indicators on TradingView, but the top ones were so data-heavy that they didn’t even render on my machine.\n\nThis is a problem traders complain about a lot even in the comments of the scripts I ended up using.\n\nIf you cannot render a volume profile indicator, go to its settings and lower the number of lookback periods or the numbers of rows (as in rows of price levels).\n\n\n  Lower lookback period value will place the histogram closer to current price action. This is because it will use shorter time span to calculate the traded volumes.\n  Lower rows value will make the histogram sparse. The price-volume levels will be farther apart.\n\n\nVolume Indicators used in this ScriptSpotlight\n\n\n  Volume profile fixed range by LUX on TradingView. This is a fixed range histogram that works ok on crypto charts in default settings. It was developed in 2021 specifically for crypto.\n  Volume profile per day by juliangonzaconde on TradingView. This has optional support and resistance lines which you will have to tweak a lot or switch off for crypto: the script was developed on a legacy index market and cannot handle the volatility of crypto too well in default settings.\n  Cryptowatch VolProf with Lock Range set to “visible”.\n\n\nI encourage you to test all three of the indicators and see how comfortable you are working with each of them.\n\nEach of them has pros and cons and needs to be traded in a certain way. I think it will be clearer with examples to show you what’s a long setup and what’s a short setup with volume profiles.\n\nTo make it clear what you are looking at, I will first list out the three common volume profile patterns you will need to search for regardless of the style of your volume profile.\n\nHow to Read Volume Profile Patterns\n\n\n\nIn any iteration of volume profile, you will get a vertical histogram on a side of your chart.\n\nThe histogram will get highlighted through one part - those are the prices of higher traded volume, or the value area.\n\nSomewhere around the middle of the value area, the histogram will give you a horizontal line. That’s the price of highest traded volume, or the (volume) point of control - shortened POC, or VPOC.\n\nIn a balanced market that is going perfectly sideways, the value area and POC will be around the middle of the histogram. In markets that are trending or taking a breather before trending, the value area will be shifted upwards or downwards.\n\n\n  \n    “p pattern”\n\n    The high volume area is near the highest price of the timespan for which your volume profile was calculated.\n\n    \n  \n  \n    “b pattern”\n\n    The high volume area is below the highest price of the timespan for which your volume profile was calculated.\n\n    \n  \n  \n    “B pattern”\n\n    There are two high volume areas in the range you are using, one at the top and one at the bottom. Wheread in p and b patterns the POC area of the chart is most important, in B patterns it is often the lowest volume zone (or the “gap”) that is worth considering.\n\n    \n  \n\n\nFirst look: LUX’s Fixed Range Volume Profile\n\nI will start with Volume profile fixed range by LUX on TradingView. This is what it looks like in the default settings:\n\n\n\nFigure 1 - Volume profile fixed range by LUX on TradingView\n\nYou see it renders to give you a histogram pretty much over the visible range of the chart.\n\nThe range is fixed by the number of candles, so you can go ahead and switch to other timeframes to get the same type of view. The time span used will be different, but the number of candles used the same.\n\nTrading with LUX’s Volume Profile\n\nThe disadvantage of fixed range volume profile is that it can easily show you a skewed snapshot of the market.\n\nFigure 2 shows what you get for lookback of 250 and 100 rows gives on the 4H BTCUSD chart.\n\nIn this case, the settings of 250 just about captures the latest leg up and the consequent flag. You see that there was very low volume on the actual advance (typical of crypto) and the high volume area is around the current flag.\n\n\n\nFigure 2 - 250 lookback - Volume profile fixed range by LUX on TradingView\n\nThe standard reading of volume profile will say that this is a p-pattern, a bull flag with healthy volume distribution, and that’s likely a continuation.\n\nBut let’s now look what happens if you change lookback just by 50, to 300.\n\n\n\nFigure 3 - 300 lookback - Volume profile fixed range by LUX on TradingView\n\nOn Figure 3 you can see that suddenly it is the B-pattern, with two high volume areas. This is because now the volume profile picked up the tail of the previous flag.\n\nThe standard reading of a B-pattern would say that the market may want to retrace to the lowest volume area and bounce from there. This is the somewhat infamous expectation of “filling the gap”.\n\nWhat gives?\n\nYou need time records\n\nTo trade volume profile reasonably, you need comparison between different time periods.\n\nUsing fix range profile, you will have to check it at regular intervals, with the same lookback value, and make notes on the chart to mark that day’s value area and POC.\n\nIf you simply increase your lookback, it won’t be the same thing because your histogram will always count back from the present moment.\n\nA bit prehistoric, but you get what you pay for.\n\nWhy the daily volume profile may be easier to read\n\nThe reason for getting the comparison is that you need to see how the volume profile developed over time to gauge the type of the market. Think of it this way: The traded volume in the value area is just volume, it doesn’t have a direction. They are trades made, each one of them with a buyer and a seller.\n\nTo get directional information, just look at your previous time periods. Example: Last high-volume block was at price X, how did traders react? - The buyers ended up prevailing, because at the moment the market is trading higher.\n\nThe interpretation of this is not set in stone either, I warn you. If you’ve ever heard of Steidlmayer’s market profile, you probably get it. Continuing the last example:\n\n  What is the mood on the market, now that buyers have got the upper hand?\n  Is this the kind of market that is “reactive” and will now sell off back to some mean value?\n  Or does the market have the “initiative” and will just keep making legs up?\n\n\nGetting strictly bound data is helpful\n\nHere the alternative TradingView’s volume profile might be of use: Volume profile per day by juliangonzaconde on TradingView paints one histogram per trading day, which is from midnight to midnight UTC globally. This is useful in that it gives uniform chunks of time, but it only does 24-hour spans which means you won’t get reasonable data from it on long time-frames. On a 1D chart it will give you one POC per each candle.\n\nBut on a 1h chart or lower you will get data that is easy to understand - see Figure 4: On 2 Nov the POC was around 63000 USD. What did traders do? Ended up shorting it. The day after? POC was still too high. The 5th and 6th of November? The POC stayed almost the same, some buyers must have shown up at these levels.\n\n\n\nFigure 4 - Volume profile per day by juliangonzaconde on TradingView\n\nThe LUX’s fixed range script actually offers an optional POC line rendering that kind of simulates the historical development of the volume profile. On Figure 5 it is shown as the red line.\n\nIt needs a bit to wrap your head around how to use it, but it is essentially just supply vs demand thinking: Did the POC act as a support, or as a resistance?\n\n\n\nFigure 5 - POC charting - Volume profile fixed range by LUX on TradingView\n\nFor more fluid data you will need to go to Cryptowatch, or at least double check back with it. The volume profile there is just the plain visible range. It will show you the full histogram as it develops in time.\n\n\n\nFigure 6 - Cryptowatch\n\nKeeping your eye on the price action and on the high volume area at the same time, you will be able to see which side of the market ended up prevailing in the high volume ranges. But be careful - having too much freedom in your charting can make you paint the picture you want to see.\n\nConclusion\n\nFrom my point of view, the daily volume blocks are the most useful to analyse the market for the longer run and getting the bigger picture.\n\nThe fix range or visible range volume profiles on the other hand give much better information for short-term charting and trading. Filling of the gap is also something more likely to happen on your 15 minute time frame than in a massive weekly range.\n",

      title: "5 Things to Know Before You Buy BNB (Binance Coin)",
      content: "With a 3.34% of market dominance and #3 market rank at the time of writing, Binance Coin has become quite a big deal among cryptocurrencies.\n\nSo what is BNB, or Binance coin?\n\nBNB is a cryptocurrency launched by Binance Exchange. Represented by 'BNB,' the CoinMarketCap declared Binance the largest cryptocurrency exchange market in 2021, with more than 1.4 million transactions processed on this platform every second.\n\nWhat has made Binance so popular that it has surpassed other cryptocurrencies in terms of transaction volume? Strong fundamentals, traders would say.\n\n\n  Binance exchange is easy to use\n  New alt coins are listed quickly\n  There is both DeFi staking and network staking available\n\n\nIn this post, we will walk you through the details of BNB and a few things you should know before buying these coins.\n\nNot the first exchange coin, not the last\n\nBinance originally operated on the Ethereum network, which currently is and has been notorious for high fees and congestions.\n\nOver time, Binance has moved on to its native cryptocurrency of the Binance Chain, the company's own ledger. The network is run and managed by a Chinese company, \"Beijie Technology.\"\n\nChangPeng Zhao, the developer of Binance, and his team have done a tremendous job taking Binance to the bleeding edge of the quickly developing cryptocurrency trading industry.\n\nThe creation of BNB is certainly one big part of that. It is not the first exchange token that came to existence, but it is the first one that took the industry by a storm.\n\nHere's a look at the five essential things you should know if you invest in Binance Coin.\n\n\n  \n    Buy Binance Coin from a safe exchange\n\n    Despite being a popular cryptocurrency network, Binance is not accessible from all countries out there. Many people are looking for alternatives.\n\n    Cryptocurrency offers robust security. Still, you cannot prevent scams. Your safety is in your hands.\n\n    Consider the quality, security, and compliance of the crypto exchange before buying Binance Coins. You can't just buy BNB from any local crypto exchange.\n\n    The safest place to buy BNB is the official Binance exchange. That's also the place where a vast majority of crypto traders buy Binance coins.\n\n    Just like with FTX, there are two versions of the Binance platform — the international version (original) and the US-limited Binance. The latter does offer BNB for trading, but it has a limited number of crypto markets overall.\n\n    Crypto.com is another cryptocurrency trading platform that offers Binance coins. However, it is a bit difficult to navigate since the app is crammed with many features and cryptocurrencies.\n\n    Research is important. Whichever cryptocurrency exchange platform you choose for buying any alt coin, research it well.\n\n    Read reviews, check the website's licenses and encryption, and buy Binance only if it looks like a credible place. It is better to stick to the safest exchange \"Binance Exchange\" to avoid any scam or other security issues.\n  \n  \n    Learn about BNB before making an investment\n\n    Binance may be the world's most popular cryptocurrency, but that doesn't mean you should buy these coins without any research.\n\n    The prices of cryptocurrencies keep fluctuating every second. Binance is not an exception.\n\n    You might be getting a good deal now, but what if the prices dip after you have purchased the coins?\n\n    It's a fact that you cannot tell whether the prices of BNB or any other cryptocurrency (for that matter) will rise or dip in the future. Trading strategy, however, can help you make an informed investment decision.\n\n    Like any other investment, it is important to learn more about Binance, how it is traded, what are its prices, and its current market capitalization. Research makes the job easier. Plus, it tells you how many BNB coins you should buy initially.\n\n    Binance is most commonly used for reducing trading fees, as the Binance Smart Chain is cheaper than the Ethereum network. But that's just one reason why its popularity has skyrocketed in no time.\n\n    Binance Smart Chain supports complex Smart Contracts, which gives the crypto trader an opportunity to borrow money, make payments, and execute advanced financial activities right on blockchain, without the interference of a middleman. There is no government or any corporate worker involved in the process.\n\n    The concept was started by Ethereum, but Binance really took it to the next level, or so it seems.\n\n    Just remember one thing — spend only what you can afford to lose. You might have heard of the stories of the investors becoming millionaires and billionaires with crypto investments. That may sound tempting, but be aware that BNB is a risky and volatile asset.\n  \n  \n    Binance doesn't have any headquarter\n\n    Surprisingly, Binance doesn't have any headquarters. Despite being the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange and the owner of CoinMarketCap, Binance does not have any location that it can call home.\n\n    It does have physical locations. In fact, many offices of Binance are located in different corners of the world. It also has more than 2000 employees. They follow the crypto ethos that believe cryptocurrency should be borderless.\n\n    The company's CEO has mentioned that they don't need a physical border or a traditional setup to run the cryptocurrency exchange.\n\n    Binance has, however, purchased licenses to run its exchange in the US and other countries that have made licenses a mandatory requirement for running a crypto exchange. The company tried to have a similar setup in the UK, but it did not proceed with its application.\n\n    Not having a headquarter clearly indicates Binance's commitment to the Bitcoin principle. However, if it has to keep expanding on the global level, the company has to have headquarters.\n\n    Fortunately, Zhao said that they were in the process of building headquarters in different parts of the world, according to Economic Times.\n\n    He added that the team decided to follow the original principle of cryptocurrency, i.e. keeping it open and decentralized with no physical borders. However, to operate a centralized exchange, a physical and legal structure is very important.\n  \n  \n    Consider its regulatory challenges\n\n    It is getting harder and harder for crypto networks to comply with the current regulatory requirements.\n\n    We've seen Binance as a popular and the leading cryptocurrency exchange platform in the world. So, why would the UK ban it? Or, why does Binance no longer operate in Ontario, Canada?\n\n    Binance is safe; there is no denying that. However, it is associated with many regulatory challenges that each investor should consider before buying this coin.\n\n    For example, you cannot buy Binance if you are from the UK or are currently living there. Similarly, you cannot buy and sell Binance in Ontario.\n\n    The government and authorities are getting concerned about people's safety. That's why the rules regarding crypto trading are getting stricter in many countries.\n\n    The concern is about cryptocurrency being used to hide criminal activities and for money laundering. There is also a concern about the investors using the modern trading tools that increase the trading risks, especially in the market that's already pretty risky.\n\n    Fortunately, Binance has always taken its regulatory compliance seriously. They are investing in these compliances to provide a safe environment for crypto traders. In fact, in a recent interviewwith Bloomberg, Zhao said that they have the highest number of crypto licenses (as compared to other crypto networks in the world).\n\n    The other networks getting licenses in places where Binance is not considered an authorized trading network can hamper the coin's growth. So, for any investor planning to buy Binance, it is important to consider its regulatory compliance before making any decision.\n  \n  \n    Binance has witnessed a 900% growth since 2019\n\n    Another reason for the growing popularity of Binance is that it has converted $10,000 into $100,000 and more in the past two years. This means if you purchased Binance Coins in 2019, in 2021 they were worth 900% more than your purchase price. That's quite a big achievement for any investor.\n\n    If Binance could grow at such a rapid pace in just two years, you can very well imagine where this cryptocurrency can reach in the next three to five years. The sooner you buy these coins, the better the chances you will secure a good deal.\n\n    Maybe, one of the reasons for this exponential growth is the fact that Binance is not only a crypto exchange but a programmable ecosystem as well. The credit goes to the qualified and powerful team that manages its operations and makes it one of the safest cryptocurrencies on the market.\n\n    Unlike other cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin has a clear and easy-to-use system. The company has done its best in educating people about the risks associated with Binance trading. They have also made it easier for investors to use the complex Binance products.\n\n    Binance will definitely keep growing if the team launches more innovative products that make Binance a smoother, safer, and lucrative cryptocurrency exchange market.\n  \n\n\nConclusion\n\nThe most attractive part about BNB is that its use case is plain and simple and that the liquidity, backed by the largest crypto exchange in the world, is always good.\n\nNo wonder people are gravitating towards Binance Coin. The crypto trading industry is expected to grow.\n\nBarring any catastrophic accidents, if the company behind Binance keeps introducing new features and innovative trading tools, there is no reason why BNB coin should lack behind.\n",

      title: "From the industry: 5 Top Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Solutions",
      content: "Financial crimes are on the rise everywhere in the world.\n\nMoney laundering is a persistent problem in all financial sectors. Billions of dollars are lost every year to money laundering crimes.\n\nIn 2020,2,300 criminals were arrested for money laundering within the United States alone. It goes on to show how pervasive the issue is. But as financial crimes are on the rise, organizations are keeping up with effective Anti-Money Laundering solutions.\n\nA special set of software works exclusively to protect organizations and companies from money laundering. They are known as AML or Anti-Money Laundering software.\n\nAt the same time, AML regulations can be a bottleneck in user on-boarding to the point that good AML solution can give a company a real competitive advantage.\n\n\n  Onboarding at Coinbase is completely painless, because they probably use a software solution with behavioural analytics.\n  Contrary to that, when onboarding to CEX.io you are required to fill out a 22-page Typeform and wait for manual evaluation.\n\n\nWhat does AML software do?\n\nFrom the practical point of view, AML solutions serve the function of ensuring compliance with AML laws and regulations.\n\nTechnically speaking, anti-money laundering software solutions work by surveying huge datasets and identifying suspicious patterns.\n\nAML software is a complete solution for detection and evaluation of these patterns. By doing that, it protects organizations from unwillingly serving money launderers.\n\nAnti-money laundering solutions work in different ways. All the different functional components work together to provide all-around security for any organization. From protecting you against criminals to making sure you are not breaching laws, AML solutions do it all.\n\nWhile machine learning facilitates the pattern identifying features of AML solutions, other features primarily work to monitor customers and transactions. They also assess risk and ensure compliance with regulations.\n\nTop 5 Top Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Solutions\n\nAML solutions are a necessity for any firm dealing with money or sensitive information.\n\nThe cryptocurrency industry was an exception to the rule when it was in its infancy, but those days are long gone. AML/KYC is required on most trading platforms and in many cases, it may be more difficult to take your cold storage profits if those cryptocoins have a bad history and you cannot prove you only bought them afterwards.\n\nLet's explore the five top anti-money laundering solutions that ensure complete security and maintain compliance terms.\n\n\n  \n    Oracle Financial Services\n\n    \n\n    Image Source: Oracle.com\n\n    Leading banks and businesses around the world trust Oracle for their AML solutions, and the blockchain industry will probably move in the same direction. Oracle Anti-money laundering solution is a complete set of features for top-notch security.\n\n    Oracle AML solutions are active in over 140 countries. That directly translates to a huge database of users, which means better data to work out fraud patterns.\n\n    It also helps in compliance with CDD and KYC regulations. When dealing with potential money launderers, Oracle automatically scans their credentials with global watchlists.\n\n    Prebuilt regulatory analytics make sure that you are never breaching AML regulations. Once you start using Oracle AML solutions, you need not worry about the technical complications and nuances of AML regulatory statutes. It is a complete solution for comprehensive protection against money laundering.\n\n    Deutsche Bank, HDFC Bank, and CaixaBank are some prominent users of Oracle AML solutions. They manage and bill a total of $200 billion.\n  \n  \n    Refinitiv\n\n    \n\n    Image Source: G2\n\n    Refinitiv World-Check Risk Intelligence is a part of Refinitiv Financial Solutions.\n\n    Founded in 2018, the company has gained a good reputation in a short time. Its breakthrough product in the AML field is the World-Check Risk Intelligence. It takes care of all your compliance policies, protects you from criminals, and warns you of threats.\n\n    Refinitiv takes pride in its research methodology, claiming to bring only reliable intelligence to you. Their evaluation criteria are strict to minimize chances of slip-ups.\n\n    Some of the Refinitiv analysts are former employees of central and federal governments, which is a good guarantee of quality. They know and in and out of AML policies and threats, do a great job of offering protection.\n\n    Data from the World-Check Risk Intelligence report can be integrated into third-party platforms, such as cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\n    Being the smaller player, Refinitiv is winning through interoperability and productivity.\n  \n  \n    Verafin\n\n    \n\n    Image Source: Verafin\n\n    Verafin offers a cloud-based cross-platform AML solution that more than 3000 companies use to protect against money laundering. You get all standard AML solutions like high-risk customer management, fraud detection, AML compliance, and information sharing. With Verafin, you can keep things simple while ensuring robust security.\n\n    The biggest challenge to detecting financial criminals is their use of multiple platforms.

However, with Verafin you can be sure of outsmarting criminals.\n\n    Verafin uses machine learning and collaborative investigation to alert you of all potential threats. You get a comprehensive solution encompassing detection, investigation, and reporting.\n\n    Verafin also comes with a very useful feature that keeps companies updated about the latest trends on financial crimes. They use information from their large datasets and combine it with customer feedback to detect threats and identify patterns.\n  \n  \n    SEON\n\n    \n\n    Image Source: SEON Resources\n\n    SEON is another complete anti-money laundering software solution that protects your enterprise from every aspect of money laundering.\n\n    SEON is popular especially in the gaming industry. Their software beats other solutions with its accurate behavioral analytics and real-time alerts - both are important aspects of the entertainment business.\n\n    SEON offers the best services with respect to the KYC processes. With extensive support for the entire process, SEON makes sure all your KYC requirements are fulfilled. It has a smart real-time identity verification system that makes its KYC solutions so effective.\n\n    Another reason why gaming (and other) startups choose SEON in particular is the transparent pricing and hassle-free set up it provides.\n  \n  \n    SAS Anti-money Laundering\n\n    \n\n    Image Source: SAS\n\n    Our last entry on the list is SAS Anti-money Laundering services.\n\n    SAS implemented artificial intelligence and machine learning to detect behavioural patterns and warns you in cases of threat.\n\n    The biggest perk of using SAS Anti-money Laundering is its out-of-the-box interface. With this intuitive interface, analysts can work faster and with more ease. On a broad scale, it leads to increased productivity and faster result generation.\n\n    With multi-jurisdictional watchlist coverage, customer behaviour monitor and a host of other features, SAS Anti-money Laundering is a complete AML solution for any enterprise.\n  \n\n\nIn conclusion\n\nEvery year, 2% to 5% of the global GDP is lost to money laundering activities. For financial firms, industry leaders, and last but not least the governments, this is a primary cause of concern.\n\nIn 2022, AML solutions are non-negotiable for almost all types of cryptocurrency businesses.\n",

      title: "Ledger Phishing Attacks: 3 Easy Tips To Protect Your Crypto Stash",
      content: "If you have any online footprint related to crypto, you probably got a phishing email at least once.\n\nLedger wallet owners have been under attack from scammers through most of 2020. Ledger wallet customers have been debating whether Ledger sold their data. Ledger finally admitted in December 2020 that the company suffered a data breach in July 2020 and customer data are being sold online now.\n\nIn this article we are going to list out the most dangerous phishing techniques you’ll come across.\n\nWe are also going to touch on the subject of why phishing works even though EVERYONE knows they should not click on links in suspicious emails.\n\nAnd lastly we will give you a couple of easy tricks to improve your protection against phishing. They are not anything technical.\n\nCrypto Phishing Techniques Targeting Wallet Users\n\nSince mid 2020, the Ledger phishing campaign has been most active via e-mail and on the official Ledger Reddit forum, r/ledgerwallet.\n\nThe emails will typically come from an email address such as legder.com. This is a misspelling of “ledger” but it is barely noticeable at first glance. The email contents looks like legitimate Ledger emails.\n\nThe Ledger phishing scam exists in several variants.\n\n\n  Sometimes the phishing urges you to download a security update for your Ledger wallet. It will offer a button for you to click to get the update.\n  In some variants of the phishing, the link will take you to a website that will ask for your seed. Once you enter your seed there, you lose your crypto.\n  Alternatively, it may download a malicious copy of the Ledger Live application that will steal your seed through a more sophisticated method. This is pretty much a malware.\n\n\nThe same email list has been repurposed to phish Exodus staking wallet users, Electrum users and more.\n\nWhat you need to know\n\n\n  Ledger, Exodus nor Electrum never asks for your seed in any website interface.\n  Specifically to Ledger: Updates to Ledger Live can be downloaded through a note that appears inside the Ledger Live app when an update is available. Do not download software from an email link.\n  Exodus, Electrum and any other software wallet is always a free software wallet that you can use anonymously. That means, the developers of these wallets cannot know your email address! Consequently, any email that claims to be from Exodus is necessarily a scam.\n\n\n\n\nWhy do so many people fall for phishing?\n\nNow for the fun part.\n\nEveryone and their grandma knows we should not click on links in unexpected emails. It has been hammered into our heads for the past twenty odd years.\n\nSo why do we still click then?\n\n\n  \n    We are stressed out\n\n    Crypto exchange support imposters leverage this extremely well.\n\n    Imagine your laptop gets stolen and you can’t find your crypto exchange 2FA backup. You try to open a support ticket from your phone, but the browser wants you to log in first. You cannot do that, so you go to their Reddit or Telegram page and try to get a support rep there.\n\n    Like magic, a support staff messages you, happy to assist. It’s someone with the exchange logo in their avatar, it looks legit, you start explaining your problem…Yeah they are not real support staff. They are an imposter trying to lock you out of your account.\n\n    But you’re not thinking straight because you have 1000 other things on your mind if your laptop just got snatched. You go with what seems most likely, and fall for the scam.\n\n    Solution: Repeat after me - In crypto, if somebody looks like they really want to help you, they are probably a scammer. Count to 5 before you tell somebody anything about any wallet or any account you might have.\n  \n  \n    We are not yet awake\n\n    Scrolling through social media and emails is is in fact the first thing we do in the morning. Usually while we are still in bed.\n\n    It is extremely easy to click on anything that looks somewhat plausible when you are not yet fully awake. You just don’t really judge very well.\n\n    Solution: Ignore any messages that want you do more than yes vs no (or like vs dislike) until you actually get up.\n  \n  \n    They sound professional\n\n    This is most dangerous during work, because you get a lot of legitimate emails that are like that. Chatting with clients or managers primes you to understand every incoming email as work communication.\n\n    This is why the wallet update scam is so successful: It sounds technical, professional, just like any work email.\n\n    Solution: Update your wallets regularly. Once a month is fine. Just do it on your own, directly from the wallet app. This way you can relax and completely ignore any wallet update alerts you get per email.\n  \n\n\n\n\nAnd Btw…How did the cybercriminals find your email address?\n\nLeaked e-mail address is no big deal, as long as you use 2FA everywhere and as long as you are aware that phishing exists and you should use your brain before clicking on any links.\n\nJust in case you’re curious how did we come to rampant phishing campaigns in the crypto industry, here’s a short list of the most common ways crypto enhusiasts’ emails get out there.\n\n\n  Big crypto companies like Ledger or Coinbase do not sell your data. As explained in the intro, have been breaches that leaked email addresses along with physical addresses, though.\n  Contrary to crypto exchanges, airdrop and ICO people DO sell their email lists. You may want to use a single-serving email alias if you are curious who sells and who doesn’t.\n  Sadly, your email could also leak through a marketing agency’s CRM, if it was breached. In this case your email might be known even if you never used it to sign up anywhere because agencies often collect contact data through automated data mining.\n  If you run a crypto related blog, your contact email addresses are on every phisher’s list.\n\n\nYou can check if your email leaked through a breach on HaveIBeenPwnd.\n",

      title: "Start Here: Beginner&#39;s Primer to the Crypto Trading Industry",
      content: "On October 5, 2009, a historic event took place. It was on that day that the first bitcoin rate against the US dollar was published on the New Liberty Standard website, $ 1 = 1,309.03 BTC.\n\nYes, yes, for one dollar you could buy more than a thousand bitcoins, and not vice versa.\n\nThe cost of bitcoin at that time was determined based on the average power consumed by the computer miner, multiplied by the cost of electricity, and divided by the number of generated bitcoins.\n\n\n  In the beginning, the price of 1 BTC was determined by the cost of mining alone.\n\n\nThis is how the fair price of bitcoin was worked out in the early days: Derived strictly from the network fundamentals, namely the energy consumption of the Proof of Work algorithm.\n\nThe price discovery done via speculative trading has shifted the price per coin a whole lot - to more than $ 57,000 as of the time of writing.\n\n\n  Speculative trading of cryptos started at scale in 2010.\n\n\nOn July 17, 2010, the MtGox exchange was founded, which quoted the main national currencies against bitcoin. MtGox was the first international bitcoin exchange where speculative trading became possible at scale.\n\nEventually, Bitcoin's growing popularity has spurred the emergence of other cryptocurrencies, with a total market capitalization $2.39T as per coinmarketcap.com at the time of writing.\n\nDozens of different cryptocurrency exchanges have emerged, and considering the active growth of the blockchain industry, many more are yet to come.\n\nThe state of the cryptocurrency market in 2022\n\nAs time passes and the crypto markets become more mature, the global cryptocurrency markets show increasingly more stability.\n\nIt is certainly worth pointing out that this trend of maturing towards stability is occurring in spite of the lack of legislative regulation.\n\nThe main characteristics of crypto markets remain their transnational nature, the chaotic emergence and sometimes disappearance of new cryptocurrencies as well as of exchanges.\n\nAs per coinmarketcap.com, the global market is dominated by Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and other currencies that happen to be trending at the moment, such as Cardano, AVA or Kusama.\n\nGo here to exchange AVA to Kusama.\n\nLegacy brokers adopting cryptocurrency derivatives\n\nThe Chicago Mercantile Exchange, or CME for short, is a major US platform for trading futures contracts for energy, currency pairs, metals, and agricultural products. In December 2017, the CME launched futures contracts for the BTC rate against the US dollar. That was the first instance of a legacy financial institution launching a cryptocurrency product.\n\nIt is only logical that legacy brokers would start with derivatives. The decentralized nature of blockchains requires for cryptocurrencies to be stored in a specific way.\n\nTo hold actual cryptocurrency, legacy brokers would need to hire a provider of crypto custody and connect that custody to the brokerage’s current trading engines. That is expensive and technically so cutting-edge a solution that it is not yet very well established.\n\nLaunching a derivative market on the other hand is much simpler. The items that are moved through the order book operations are just contracts, not the actual cryptocurrency. All the broker needs to make sure of is that they have a cold storage with enough cryptocurrency to fully back the volumes that are traded in contracts on their platform. The cold storage is separated from the trading platform, which makes everything easier and most importantly cheaper.\n\nTraders like leveraged derivatives for their volatility\n\nOne of the reasons why cryptocurrency trading gained in popularity is the volatility of cryptocurrencies.\n\nFluctuations in the Bitcoin dollar rate per day often reach 10%, and Bitcoin is the most stable cryptocurrency at that. Intraday price changes in ratio markets between bitcoin and alt cryptocurrencies can exceed 100% per trading session.\n\nSweeping fluctuations of this size mean that there are opportunities for earning more money per day trading cryptocurrency markets than you could possibly earn with comparable skill and capital on legacy markets in the same time period. For comparison, the S&amp;P 500 index usually moves by less than 1.5% per day.\n\nHowever, the high volatility is also the reason why you get risk warnings everywhere: Do your own research, do not invest more than you can afford to lose, be careful with leverage.\n\nRead about the worst margin trading mistakes that new crypto traders make.\n\nPassive Investing Enters The Crypto Space\n\nAs explained in the beginning of the article, the cryptocurrency space is not regulated and neither are the crypto trading platforms. Those of you coming from simple legacy investing like IRA, you will need to get used to a bit more due diligence before you send money anywhere on the crypto markets.\n\nGood news is that you do not actually need to trade anymore to make regular profit in crypto.\n\nFor those of you used to the idea of investing as putting money into index funds and waiting, there is now an equivalent in crypto. It is increasingly more common for alt coin wallets to let you stake your coins and earn interest just for holding crypto. This is the closest analog to the old-school passive investing of 1980s.\n\nWhat if you do actually want to take up active trading?\n\nThen you will first need to decide on the exchange. The best way to go about that is the systematic one: Make a list of criteria.\n\nWe suggest focusing on the following:\n\n\n  exchange turnover (traded volumes)\n  variety of products (spot, futures, big and small currencies)\n  trading with borrowed funds (AKA margin trading or leveraged trading)\n  deposit requirements\n  registration requirements (do you need to pass KYC/AML?)\n  supported order types and their reliability (can you set a stop loss?)\n  the stability of the exchange to hacker attacks\n  fees charged for trading, deposit, and withdrawal of funds\n\n\nYou will find most of this data on aggregator platforms such as coinmarketcap.com or its smaller equivalents that we list at our Tools page.\n\nFinal words\n\nThe crypto markets of 2022 are stabilizing and calming down in spite of the lack of top-down regulation. The crypto trading industry now has products for the risk loving derivatives traders as well as for the passive investing types who until now had to stick to legacy index funds.\n\nAs always though, do your own research before you put your money at risk. And also: Not your keys, not your coin.\n",

      title: "What is Terra and How to claim Terra Airdrops?",
      content: "Author’s Update Jun 16, 2022: Sorry for everyone’s loss.\n\nTerra is one of the most hotly trending and promising crypto projects around right now. As Bitcoin and other volatile cryptocurrencies are continuing to fluctuate wildly in value, some investors are now jumping on the Terra bandwagon in order to diversify their portfolio.\n\nTerra money is a DeFi fintech payment network that uses fiat-pegged stablecoins (backed by Luna cryptocurrency) to allow for programmable payment and financial development.\n\nOverseen by Terraform Labs, the Terra crypto project has gained widespread popularity over recent years. Through the Terra team, top investors such as LightSpeed Venture Partners, Arrington Capital, and Pantera have agreed to commit $150 million to help expand various projects related to the promising cryptocurrency.\n\nTerra Labs and their partners have developed an application running on the company's blockchain tech to permanently record the firm's crypto financial transactions.\n\nOfficial wallets can be downloaded at https://www.terra.money/.\n\n\n\nIf you’re interested in Terra Airdrops, you might want to read about our tools for (diversified) trading of DeFi tokens\n\nWhat is the Terra Stablecoin\n\nThe Terra stablecoin, like most stablecoins, has been designed to manage the volatility problem of regular cryptos such as Bitcoin.\n\nIOU Stablecoins like Tether (USDT), are pegged to traditional fiat currencies such as the U.S. Dollars through cash and are backed by a cash equivalent.\n\nIn the case of Terra stablecoin, the backing is done via the Luna alt coin.\n\nTo create new Terra Money (UST stablecoin tokens), the developers burn a percentage of another digital token called Luna. When the demand for UST goes up, more Luna tokens are automatically burned and channeled to a community pool; this balancing strategy helps stabilize the value of Terra to a certain degree.\n\nAccordingly, Luna directly varies with the economic growth rate of the Terra ecosystem, as explained by Terra CEO, Kwon.\n\nAnytime a user buys something with UST, transaction fees are applied in a similar way to debit card and credit card transactions. These fees are distributed among people who hold Luna tokens like stock dividends.\n\nHow to Claim Terra Airdrops\n\nWe will first list the two most convenient ways to be eligible for an airdrop and then list the ways in which airdropped money is distributed.\n\nThis is a long-running airdrop campaign.\n\nLoop market\n\nIf you join Loop Market, you stand the chance to benefit from airdrops on Terra.\n\nApart from cryptocurrency airdrops, Terraform Labs operates several projects including the Anchor app, which provides a high-yield savings account for alt coin holders of the group's digital currencies.\n\nThere are more yield options to choose from though - the Terra group currently has 50 projects in the pipeline.\n\nOrion Money and Terra Airdrops\n\nOrion Money forms another part of Terra's ecosystem.\n\nIt introduces an easy way for users to gain stable yields from Anchor Protocol and other stablecoin chains.\n\nWhile Orion Money traces its origins to Terra's ecosystem, its central target lies beyond the scope of Terra. Orion aims to leverage the power of Terra's platform and channel its energy on the ETH network to ensure a smooth energy flow between Terra and other systems out there.\n\nAirdrops on Terra will be distributed in the following way:\n\n\n  \n    Luna stakers: a fraction of genesis airdrops will be shared between all Luna stakers according to their stakes with some caps\n  \n  \n    Orion delegators: a separate share of genesis airdrop will be given to all delegators who stake their Luna with Orion validators during the time the initial snapshot is taken.\n  \n\n\nIn addition to that, delegators who keep staking their Luna with the Orion validators will receive monthly airdrops for one year.\n\nTerra hopes that its airdrops will serve as good rewards to Luna stakers and Orion validator delegators for their maximum support shown to the project.\n",

      title: "IOTA (MIOTA): The Complete Guide",
      content: "Years of effort on digital currency technology saw hundreds of cryptocurrencies on the financial markets. But if you are looking for the IOTA coin specifically, this complete guide should be your best choice.\n\nThis content will tell you all about the IOTA coin, including how much is one IOTA to BTC. Let's get started.\n\n\n  Basics of IOTA\n  Why IOTA?\n  Top IOTA Exchanges\n  Final words &amp; Further Reading\n\n\nBasics of IOTA\n\nDefining IOTA\n\nUnlike most other cryptocurrencies, IOTA does not use a traditional blockchain-type of ledger. IOTA has a tangle technology which works better with IoT, because it is more scalable and allows for lower transaction fees.\n\nThe transfer of data inside tangle technology is quite safe, although it is important to remember that tangle is a new concept and hiccups may occur.\n\nThanks to tangle’s microtransaction capacity, you can easily transfer without charges.\n\nThe most recent practical application of the advantages of tangle is in automated KYC and solutions for identity verification.\n\nMIOTA vs IOTA\n\nIs it MIOTA or IOTA? If you are new to IOTA or cryptocurrency as a whole, this may look confusing.\n\nMIOTA is a unit of IOTA. This is why you will see MIOTA on almost all alt coin exchanges, and the price of IOTA is usually quoted in MIOTA. The “M” stands for “million”, because 1 MIOTA is the equivalent of 1,000,000 IOTA.\n\nAll crypto trading platforms currently use the MIOTA scale to trade the IOTA cryptocurrency.\n\nHistory of IOTA\n\nThis digital coin technology relates to the use of the IoT ecosystem. It started as a project to save money and energy from hardware. IOTA had three co-founders making a big shift in digital currency technology without the need for blockchain as a structure.\n\nWhy IOTA?\n\nAlliances\n\nThe IOTA coin aims to spread through application in day-to-day small, routine transactions. That is why the IOTA team focuses on creating alliances with the business world.\n\nThey managed to get some large and famous companies as their partners, including DELL or The Linux Foundation.\n\nA Bright Future\n\nWith all the investments in technology-based structures, the Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to cross the $250 billion mark in the years to come.\n\nThe IOTA coin is targeting this market and actively working towards getting a good share of it.\n\nAdvanced Tech\n\nAs explained before, IOTA uses the tangle technology, which provides infinite scalability and enables microtransaction fees to be zero.\n\nBecause tangle enables such drastically lower fees than both traditional proof-of-work and the new proof-of-stake algorithms, adding some IOTA can be a reasonable way to approach portfolio diversification.\n\nEnvironment\n\nTo generate an energetic populace, IOTA has created an effective environment to speed up its technology development and adoption.\n\nTop IOTA Exchanges\n\nGodex.io\n\nCreated around three years ago, it is a platform that enables swift and anonymous conversion between cryptocurrencies, providing a simple yet efficient user experience.\n\nPros\n\n\n  Offers over 200 different coins\n  No limits on order sizes and types\n  High-speed transactions\n  Bonuses awarded by its affiliate program\n\n\nCons\n\n\n  Currently, the platform doesn't allow fiat currency trading\n\n\neToro\n\neToro is a renowned Israeli exchange platform that has been operating for more than a decade. It serves clients from the UK and Australia through better financial regulatory bodies. As for its other clients, it uses a unit operated by a commission in Cyprus.\n\nPros\n\n\n  No charges for stock and ETF trading\n  Swift account opening\n  You can observe and learn from strategies used by other traders\n\n\nCons\n\n\n  Apart from trading, fees related to withdrawal and inactivity are high\n  Cash is only available in U.S. dollars\n  Contacting customer support is hard\n\n\nBinance\n\nFinance is an exchange that got popular fast. It has now become one of the most renowned exchanges in the world of cryptocurrency.\n\nPros\n\n\n  Charges lower fees than other cryptocurrency exchanges\n  Provides more than 100 cryptocurrency and trading pairs\n  With its two-factor authentication, it has more advanced trading tools\n\n\nCons\n\n\n  It is not supported in seven U.S. states, including New York.\n  Compared to other countries, it provides fewer trading pairs in the U.S.\n\n\nFinal Words\n\nThis was a brief intro into the IOTA coin and the technology it uses.

      content: "No doubt, search engine optimization takes a lot of work and its results are never fully predictable due to the changes in search algorithms that are beyond the SEO experts’ control.\n\nAdd to it the only somewhat predictable volatility of crypto markets, and we have a hot mix. Or do we?\n\nIn this report we looked into the search trends for crypto with the crypto SEO experts from UniK to see how the crypto marketing industry is doing.\n\nAnd more importantly, can we actually see any signs of the blockchain space becoming mature?\n\nThe Current State of Cryptocurrency SEO\n\nCryptocurrencies are not exactly a new thing in 2021, and neither is the branch of marketing industry that supports them.\n\nIn spite of that, the state of crypto search engine marketing is still quite abominable. Google was even banning cryptocurrency search ads until August 2021.\n\nTo understand the reasons for this lack of development, we need to look at who are the entities interested in crypto SEO.\n\nWho Buys Crypto Marketing Services?\n\nThey are not long-standing financial institutions, they are not even fintech startups and they are certainly not technology service providers. Most often, SEO services are procured by people who take care of the marketing for token launches.\n\nThe exact flavor of the launch changes with the trend of the season. It could be a plain new alt coin launch, a new DeFi or an NFT.\n\nBut the tactic is typically the same, short term one: Generate a huge amount of press releases and SEO posts to gain some quick reach and hopefully convince some investors. Once the token sale is over, SEO and PR go by the wayside, because the money is already collected anyway.\n\nShould Crypto Marketers Raise The Standards?\n\nThere is nothing wrong with short term tactics. I think nobody will argue with me if I say that they have worked very well for some of the alt coin creators.\n\nBut let’s pull out some Google Trends data.\n\n\n\nThe latest hype of the blockchain industry are of course the NFTs, or non-fungible tokens.\n\nGoogle search stats from Adwords puts the top number for NFT monthly searches to one million. That’s certainly a lot of interest, and a lot of opportunity to make a mark.\n\n\n\nOn the face of it, everything looks super healthy and the traction this new niche is getting seems unstoppable. That’s great, isn’t it?\n\nNow let’s lay over the search interest for the other three-letter word that everyone in the crypto world knows only too well:\n\n\n\nOne picture for a thousand words, right?\n\nThe thing that is happening to blockchain tech innovation vehicles is essentially what all the legacy finance experts keep predicting for the price of bitcoin since maybe 2011.\n\nThe music stops, and nobody ever starts caring again.\n\nCrypto SEO as an opportunity\n\nI don’t think that anyone believes that all ICOs and token launches must be a scam. It’s just that the vast majority of past ICOs were really just devices to extract money from retail investors.\n\nIt was an easy way to get money without any strings attached, so a bunch of people just went and took the money. That’s not the fault of ICOs though.\n\nThe year 2022 is coming and to this moment, there have been some 4500 different cryptocurrencies created. Fungible cryptocurrencies, mind you.\n\nIt probably doesn’t make sense tracks the amount of non-fungible tokens, since each one of them is unique. So let’s just stay with the currencies and tokens of the cryptoworld for now.\n\nOut of that sheer bulk of different blockchain-based currencies, maybe three to five different brand names stuck in the minds of any regular person who isn’t a cryptocurrency enthusiast.\n\nI am not trying to say that crypto SEO is the one secret trick that will get your crypto project up there among the biggies. But it is a fact that there is an immense opportunity for crypto entrepreneurs who have a genuine idea that they are willing to develop and promote over the span of a few years.\n\nThe current state of cryptocurrency SEO reflects how few people have been doing that until now.\n\nAt the same time, the opinions exchanged among established marketers suggests that crypto is being taken seriously: The people who are interested are young, spendy and with a lot of disposable income.\n\nIn line with this, there is a growing number of media agencies that are adding a crypto angle among their list of services. This shows the trends might start changing in 2022.\n\nFinal Words\n\nTo state the obvious, among nearly five thousands tokens, even the most genuine project will not stand out without some marketing.\n\nBut other than that, good crypto SEO with its strategic work over time can really be the tool that takes a project beyond the spam of press releases announcing a token launch.\n",

      title: "Adoption of Cryptocurrencies as Means of Payment and Opportunity for Wallet Recovery Services",
      content: "Although the pandemic was an unfortunate event, it contributed to the popularity of cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe growth of the crypto industry was not only evident in investment processes but also in adaptability as a means of payment. Even major social platforms such as PayPal and Facebook are currently working on the integration of cryptocurrency payments.\n\nFacebook's colossal platform can attract a large audience and thanks to crypto can compete with the traditional financial institutions as a tool for transfers of money.\n\nThe evolution of cryptocurrencies can be seen in the current issues the cryptocurrency community deals with. Over the years, people have wondered about the sustainability of cryptocurrencies. But since big companies adopt it as a payment method, the prominent bone of contention is how to use cryptocurrencies as the mainstream.\n\nAdoption of Crypto as Means of Payment in the World Today\n\nIn the U.S., FED network has been working with MIT to build a digital currency platform already since late 2020.\n\nThis really shows that the once thought impossible is now coming true and cryptocurrencies are aiming towards being a daily means of transaction, a regular medium of exchange.\n\nIf collaborations regarding cryptocurrency adoption don’t stall, there is no doubt crypto will thrive.\n\nThe CBDC and Crypto Adoption\n\nThe Central Bank Digital Currency, known as the CBDC, is one of the early use cases. It is a stable coin, pegged to a non-crypto asset and therefore not volatile.\n\nOne of the goals of CBDC is to make crypto transactions more manageable through decreased volatility and also more accessible to broader range of people, especially those who are not as internet-savvy as crypto enthusiasts.\n\nThis novelty is expected to enhance the security and oversight over digital currencies, including cryptocurrencies. Some consumers will be able to access their digital wallets as they nowadays access legacy financial services online.\n\nThe commercial sector has also taken a significant turn in cryptocurrency. The most recent rage is the non-fungible token, the NFT, which is traded mostly in form of artworks.\n\nAll this development puts the pressure on individuals and businesses alike to learn the ins and outs of the management of storage of cryptocurrencies. However, it is a common knowledge that this does not always work out. People make mistakes - in private and on behalf of companies as well.\n\nChinese entrepreneurs are known to take a big step in this, offering wallet recovery services becoming a rapidly growing niche.\n\nThe reason for that is the Chinese government has been trying out its digital platform known as eCNY or digital yuan. Using digital currencies is aimed to provide an anti-money laundering solution, but considering it is running on blockchain technology, wallet recovery services are projected to become even more sought-after in the near future.\n\nFuture Opportunities for Virtual Cash\n\nAlthough virtual cash still cannot compare with fiat currency as for its general usability today, digital money offers some great benefits and opportunities. That has drawn the attention of many individuals and businesses all over the world.\n\nGiven the three benefits of cryptocurrencies listed below, many business strategists will recognise the possibility of needing a wallet recovery in rare cases of an accident will still be outweighed by the benefits of being in crypto.\n\n\n  \n    Individual Control of Digital Wallet\n\n    Some businesses and individuals prefer the cryptocurrency mode of payment to the legacy form because of its lack of intermediary.\n\n    Users can perform transactions without waiting until the bank clears it, with no regard to current economic blockading or other government actions, and with no need of contacting any regulatory body for validation. Crypto uses a public ledger for validation and transactions are processed automatically.\n  \n  \n    Record Details of Every Transaction\n\n    Except for a few non-traceable alt coins, which are quite niche, regulators can track down transactions because each one is recorder in the cryptocurrency’s ledger forever.\n\n    Hence, blockchain technology is not actually the best tool to process illegal transactions!\n  \n  \n    Constant Smart Contracts Innovations\n\n    Digital coins developers keep working to develop new functionalities on major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. For some specific niche purposes, there are altcoins which is an industry that is constantly developing as well.\n\n    But it’s not only about adding new capabilities, such as smart contracts.\n\n    Initially, we had the Proof of Work mechanism to validate transactions on the first cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Many alternative cryptos now operate with the Proof of Stake mechanism, which is a faster, more eco-friendly and less expensive transaction validation system.\n\n    This movement makes it evident that virtual money will keep increasing its capacity to serve a better purpose for its users, contributing to its extended stay in the financial industry.\n  \n\n\nFinal Words\n\nThe future of cryptocurrencies as a store of value has been established by 22 but their future as means of payment is still a topic of discussion.\n\nEither way, there is no doubt that as long as cryptocurrency exists there will be the need for wallet management and recovery services on the individual as well as business level.\n",

      title: "Top 10 Things to Know Before You Buy Bitcoin",
      content: "Jumping into the world of cryptocurrencies can be thrilling, especially when you begin to discover and unlock the great uses of Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nBy 2022, you probably know someone who owns fractions of it—or perhaps you're already among those folks.\n\nBut if you haven't started your crypto journey yet even though you have been planning to do so, here is a list of top ten tips and things you should know before you buy Bitcoin.\n\n1 - You can buy fractions of Bitcoin\n\nFirst things first, you don't need to buy 1 BTC to get started in your crypto endeavor—unless you have the money, of course. At the time of writing (September 2021), Bitcoin is selling at over 46,000 USD and that's a huge amount to spend if you're just starting.\n\nBitcoin is a highly divisible asset, which is why you can buy fractions of BTC on a wide range of different crypto exchanges.\n\nSome even allow you to start with as little as 10 USD worth of BTC (like Paxful!), making it easy for you to get started.\n\n2 - A reliable and secure crypto wallet is a must\n\nBitcoin is a virtual currency that runs solely digitally. It has no physical representation like paper bills that could pile up in your wallet or coins that could jingle in your pockets or purse. Instead, it runs and operates with the help of technology or computers and smartphones connected to the internet.\n\nBefore you buy Bitcoin, you need a digital wallet where you'll send, receive, track, and manage your BTC funds and transactions.\n\nMake sure you get a secure and reliable crypto wallet from a trustworthy provider. Remember, we're talking about your money here, so it's better to be safe than sorry!\n\nSome crypto marketplaces like Paxful let you enjoy a free Bitcoin wallet right after signing up. Using wallet directly on an exchange or a p2p marketplace is the easiest and fastest way to set up a crypto wallet.\n\nA platform wallet is less secure than cold storage wallet with which you own your private keys, but it is convenient for small amounts of crypto or for your trading stack. Most traders opt to leave part of their trading stack on platforms where it is easily accessible.\n\n3 - You can buy BTC from trading and P2P exchanges\n\nLooking for the right place to buy Bitcoin? Your options include traditional and peer-to-peer (P2P) exchanges.\n\nTrading platforms have been around for a long time. This type of platform operates using order books that match buyers and sellers. Think of them as middlemen that help you complete a trade or transaction.\n\nYour other option is P2P exchanges, where you can transact directly with a buyer or seller instead of having an intermediary.\n\nYou get to choose your trading partner, how you want to send or receive payment, and which payment method you prefer, among so many other customizations. Simply put, you and your trade partner complete transactions yourselves.\n\n4 - Not every bank supports crypto transactions\n\nBitcoin's early years were far from being perfect. Like any innovation, BTC wasn't immediately accepted and trusted by many people when it first came to light.\n\nSome concerns about privacy and uses have circulated in the fintech space, which is why some banks and other financial institutions remain skeptical about it.\n\nIf you choose to fund a cryptocurrency purchase directly from your bank account, you will likely need to answer some questions. The exact same routine awaits your off-ramp, that is, selling crypto for fiat and withdrawing into your bank account. Be prepared to document the origin of your money.\n\nOn the flip side, you don't need a bank account to launch your crypto adventure—which brings us to our next important point.\n\n5 - There are tons of ways to quickly buy Bitcoin\n\nBelieve it or not, buying Bitcoin is not complicated at all. Different crypto platforms offer numerous ways to help you get your hands on BTC right away. Paxful, for example, allows you to buy BTC with the nearly 400 payment methods it supports.\n\nYou can buy Bitcoin with Paypal, bank transfers, online wallets, cash payments, and so many more. All that's left to do is choose the payment option that best suits your needs to get started.\n\n6 - Bitcoin is a highly volatile asset\n\nWhen Bitcoin was introduced by Satoshi Nakamoto, its value was nothing.\n\nFast forward to today (September 2021), Bitcoin's market price is at over 46,000 USD—insane, right? This dramatic price change is proof that Bitcoin is a highly volatile asset, which is why many investors and crypto enthusiasts became fascinated with it right away.\n\nIn case you didn't hear, Bitcoin reached an all-time high of about 65,000 USD in April of 2021—that's the kind of volatility we're talking about!\n\n7 - Trading and investing are two different things\n\nCrypto trading and investing are often interchanged by many.\n\nWhile both are great ways to make money, trading and investing are different. When you're investing in crypto , you're geared up for the long-term potential of the assets you choose, with the goal of selling them in the years to come. This means that short-term price movements aren't really your thing and those don't bother you.\n\nBut when you're trading crypto , you're more concerned about the hourly and daily movements of crypto prices in the market. Crypto traders make money by buying BTC at low prices then selling them at a higher price—could be in the next minute, hour, day, or week. This is why they're always closely looking at the market trends and making quick decisions about how to earn money out of the price movements.\n\n8 - Use 2FA and keep your password safe\n\nCyber hackers are always looking for their next potential target, so it's essential to always keep your crypto account passwords safe.\n\nMake sure it's a unique, strong, and complex combination that's difficult to guess. You should also never reuse passwords, especially not for accounts related to money.\n\nThis way, all of your accounts won't be easily compromised in case one of your passwords has been successfully cracked. And as always, keep your passwords to yourself.\n\nMost crypto wallets also allow you to enable two-factor authentication (2FA) to add another layer of protection to your Bitcoin funds. Remember, if your crypto is lost or stolen, it's gone forever.\n\n9 - You can buy BTC with minimal to no fees\n\nWhen you buy Bitcoin, the percentage of fees varies depending on the platform or exchange and the payment method you choose. Some marketplaces offer higher fees, while others allow you to buy fractions of Bitcoin with lower to no fees.\n\nPlatforms like Paxful enable you to buy Bitcoin with zero charges regardless of which payment option you choose. This makes it even easier and more affordable to get started with crypto.\n\n10 - Bitcoin is pseudonymous\n\nContrary to (still) popular belief, Bitcoin transactions aren't entirely anonymous.\n\nBitcoin transactions are pseudonymous. People's identities on the blockchain network aren't stored, but every transaction they make is publicly broadcasted and permanently recorded.\n\nNow it's important to mention that Bitcoin addresses, private and public keys, and transactions are all read in lengthy alphanumeric text strings. This means that you won't quickly identify who the person behind those long text strings is.\n\nHowever, if your real-world identity is directly linked to a Bitcoin address, people in the network can track or trace the other transactions you've made or took part in.\n\nReady to buy your first fraction(s) of Bitcoin?\n\nAfter more than a decade of existence, more and more individuals and businesses from different industries have started to get their hands on crypto.\n\nHow about you?\n\nWhen are you planning to join millions of Bitcoin holders worldwide?\n",

      title: "3 Things Are A BIG NO If You Are New To Crypto Investing",
      content: "Investing in cryptocurrency has become simpler over the years. It is now relatively easy to invest in crypto and there is more of a variety of virtual currencies to choose from as well.\n\nHowever, the industry still remains new and there are still a few things to bear in mind before entering the investment market to avoid losing money.\n\nIn this post we'll go over a list of the things that should be a hard pass for you if you want to get started in crypto investing.\n\nAlso read: How to pick the right crypto exchange for you.\n\nThe original niche and purpose of cryptocurrencies\n\nBitcoin was the first virtual currency, launched in 2009, but thousands of other alternative cryptos have since developed.\n\nThere are fallacies about cryptocurrencies that are spread solely to discredit them, but their progress is continual and growing.\n\nSome virtual currencies were designed as a replacement for the traditional payment system, which relies on physical money.\n\nSociety lost faith in banks as a result of the global financial crisis, and cryptocurrencies were seen as a way out. Bitcoin is a decentralized virtual currency, meaning it is not backed by any existing institution or government. Although the blockchain technology on which they are based is the most important feature, it is a currency, which is one of its most valuable aspects.\n\nThere are other cryptocurrencies with different fundamental goals though. An alt coin that does not aim to be a currency can still be a valuable part of your portfolio, if it gains a solid user base like for example Ethereum.\n\nIf you decide to dive into the world of crypto investing, you should first learn more about the different types of coins in the market. The jargon can sometimes feel like gibberish - for instance, nobody knew knows the difference between stablecoins vs altcoins vs bitcoin.\n\nIn short, always do your due diligence before investing, and keep in mind the following three basic things to avoid.\n\nThings not to do when investing in cryptocurrencies:\n\n1/ Don't take out loans to buy high risk assets\n\nIf you don't have enough money to invest in cryptocurrencies, you should just avoid investing.\n\nYou don't need to take out a loan; instead, save some money and then invest.\n\nOne of the most essential investment guidelines is to invest with money that you can afford to lose.\n\nThat is why having a financial cushion is preferable, and why buying crypto on credit is a bad idea. Consider this advice.\n\n2/ Don't go out and buy the first cryptocurrency you come across\n\nThere are various types of cryptocurrencies in which you can invest. Read some news and stay updated with the latest releases.\n\nYou should not invest in the first coin you come across; instead, you should conduct research, study, and observe several before making a decision. Make sure the cryptocurrency you buy in is the greatest option for you to reach your objectives.\n\nYou don't need to purchase a large number of cryptocurrencies, not even to diversify. Simply knowing which ones to purchase is sufficient.\n\nIt is a good idea to buy more than one cryptocurrency, but we don't recommend purchasing a large number of them. Examining the one that best meets your requirements is more efficient. Keep your impulses under control!\n\n3/ Don't invest without first learning about cryptocurrencies\n\nBefore investing in bitcoin or alt coins, we recommend that you first learn about them.\n\nUnderstand how cryptocurrencies work, how they differ, how they were invented, and why they exist.\n\nYou are setting yourself up to fail if you put your money in anything about which you have no information.\n\nThe best ways of investing in cryptocurrencies\n\nA multitude of methods are available for purchasing virtual currency.\n\nThere is no one-size-fits-all solution; the way to onramp that will be a good fit for you is dependent on your location, amount you want to invest as well as what you want to achieve with your investment.\n\nBelow there are some of the most prevalent methods:\n\n\n  \n    Use investment funds: They are made up of a foundation on which various assets are placed. You can store your cryptocurrency investment if you use an investing fund wisely and securely. One of the most powerful and positive factors of developing trust in the individual who invests is safety. Knowing that your investments are secure gives you more confidence.\n  \n  \n    Cryptocurrency mining: This is a popular strategy for acquiring new virtual currencies. To carry out this method, you'll need to build a mining rig and have a decently cheap supply of electric power. Mining gets more resource intensive with time, so this won’t be a one man operation unless you’re mining a brand new cryptocurrency. In established cryptos, such an operation will need a computer-savvy technical team, as they'll be performing tasks that require a particular amount of computer expertise.\n  \n  \n    Purchasing virtual currencies through a crypto trading platform: This is the most common method. This page has a list of the most popular trading platforms where cryptocurrencies may be bought and sold as well as exchanged. Furthermore, it allows traders to deal directly with the market, which makes actions easier and faster.\n  \n\n\nThese are also other options available. Did you know who they were? What are your thoughts about it? If you've previously invested in cryptocurrencies, you've almost certainly done so in one or more of them.\n\nDo you wish to invest in cryptocurrencies but are unsure how? Virtual currencies are not as complicated as they appear. It's an alternative in which you can choose to utilize money that is digital rather than traditional. Dozens of platforms throughout the planet are waiting to provide you access to thousands of coins.\n\nAnd, in order to choose the best one for you, you must first choose which attributes are most significant to you. Choose wise and be wise.\n",

      title: "5 Ways To Spend Digital Cash",
      content: "With all the excitement surrounding Bitcoin and other digital currencies making waves as an investment choice, some investors are wondering if they can spend some of their crypto like real money.\n\nNot only that - even governments and establishment in general is recently opening up to digital currencies as a means of payment.\n\nWith that said, here are some obvious and less obvious ways to spend digital cash beyond the infamous daily coffee.\n\n1 - Purchasing Goods and Services Online\n\nLet’s start with the obvious. Of course you can use cryptocurrencies as a means of payment on the internet.\n\nCashless spending is becoming a convenient way to pay for goods and services without cash on hand.\n\nNot all online stores accept bitcoin or alt coins to settle your bill but you can always use prepaid cards to shop both at physical shops and online stores. You may even use these cards to pay with bitcoin online.\n\nThere are a few apps that let you spend your hard-earned cryptocurrency by linking it to a debit card so you can use it like you would fiat currency. The actual tools vary in availability depending on your location. Just to name a few big prepaid card providers, that would be Binance, Bitpay or Coinbase.\n\nMajor credit card companies and most banks now no longer have a problem with crypto transactions, making it easier to shop wherever Visa and Mastercard are accepted.\n\nKeep in mind that prepaid crypto cards come with fees, though. Fees being the main income of the card provider, these can be hefty. Also, many cards only allow bitcoin, only some work with wider range of digital cash. You can search for companies that accept Ethereum, Dogecoin, and more.\n\n2 - Investing in Legacy Assets\n\nYou can take advantage of cashless payments via cryptocurrency, but even more opportunities are opening thanks to tokenized stocks and other blockchain-based financial vehicles that you can easily trade on platforms like FTX. That innovation finally opened the eyes of legacy finance as well as luxury goods and real estate corporations. Some of these have slowly and perhaps reluctantly started to accept cryptocurrencies as a means of payment.\n\nIt’s not only Tesla! These days, you can buy what you want with bitcoin, including investment assets.\n\nIn New York, brokerage firms are accepting digital currency for the sale of client properties. There is even a website that allows Ethereum and Stablecoin holders to purchase any of its listed distressed properties using the digital currencies they have.\n\nSome websites accept Bitcoin and Ethereum savers to buy real estate shares simply by registering their personal information and selecting how many shares they need. Clients can also invest in companies and retirement accounts. The big advantage in the latter case is that this is also open to international investors.\n\n3 - Donating To Charity\n\nIf you feel your luck turning around and want to share some of your blessings, you can pay it forward and spend your cryptocurrency on charities.\n\nThere are non-profit charitable institutions now accepting Bitcoin as a way to lower taxes as an advantage. Bitcoin is decentralized and is not under the control of the government. Likely, you won't have to pay capital gains taxes on digital cash sent to charity, but always check with your country’s laws.\n\nMost importantly, your favorite charity will receive a more significant donation compared to giving away free fiat money.\n\nIf you're also following content creators, you can support them with digital cash donations to make them less dependent on the advertising industry.\n\nVarious platforms allow users to purchase digital gifts in return for cryptocurrency to show appreciation to the people they follow online.\n\n4 - Paying in Crypto For Telecommunication Services\n\nThe first telecommunication corporation to allow Bitcoin payments was AT&amp;T. Mobile users with bitcoin stashed away can pay for their mobile bills using cryptocurrency.\n\nThe company isn't accepting bitcoins directly for now. A designated cryptocurrency processor affiliated with AT&amp;T will take the digital payment on their behalf after user verification.\n\nYou can also pay for your phone services with a combination of fiat and digital currency. The business working with the payment processor may choose a payment of whole fiat currency. When it comes to the fees, you can use bitcoin to pay for the transaction fees instead.\n\n5 - Online Gambling and Gaming\n\nIf you have some experience in online gambling and have cryptocurrency dust to burn, you may want to try your luck in adult entertainment, gaming or online casinos.\n\nOne can say that while digital currency is still not entirely mainstream, in the realm of online gambling it has been fairly common for a few years now.\n\nOne thing to note about gambling and gaming sites is that it is not a good idea to try and deposit crypto if you have zero previous experience with it. Usually gambling platforms are not the most intuitive and some may also allow you to use different cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum, which can be confusing for newbies.\n\nRemember that when choosing a platform to place bets, it's essential to do your research. This is not the most regulated of industries and owners of these sites may be fraudulent. And of course, gamble responsibly.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe success of cryptocurrency as a form of currency is gradually making its way into consumer society.\n\nThere are now many ways to spend bitcoin and alt coins in the exact same way you would spend fiat currency.\n\nWell-known companies have seen its potential and are making it easier for cryptocurrency investors to use digital money in exchange for goods and services. It won't be as surprising if it finally works like the paper bills or coins in your leather wallet one day.\n",

      title: "A Beginner&#39;s Guide to Understanding Altcoins",
      content: "Altcoins are cryptocurrencies that are not Bitcoin. They are the alternative currency to Bitcoin and they have been seeing a rise in popularity since about 2016.\n\nAltcoins were originally created to circumvent Bitcoin's limitations. Many in the early crypto community believed that Bitcoin would hit a wall and only the blockchain technology with its transparent nature would remain. That is why alternative cryptocurrencies were created.\n\nMany of the early altcoins have been created to try out new features or solve problems that Bitcoin was not able to solve on its own (e.g., Monero’s full transaction privacy was a response to Bitcoin’s pseudonymous blockchain).\n\nThroughout the history of cryptocurrency, there has been lots of volatility in price of altcoins. This is a beginner article, hence a quick risk note:\n\nAltcoins, just like Bitcoin, do not come with central banking authority backing it like dollar or euro through governments and central banks. The value of altcoins can be based fully on speculation. There is no regulatory body taking care of that and it is your own responsibility to do your due diligence.\n\nWhat is an Altcoin?\n\nAn Altcoin is a digital currency without any central authority or issuing bank. It runs on a decentralized peer-to-peer network and uses cryptographic techniques such as mining, encryption, and hashing to manage its transactions.\n\nAn altcoin is also referred to as an alternative cryptocurrency or a cryptocurrency alternative.\n\nTypes of Cryptocurrencies&amp; Their Differences\n\nCryptocurrencies have different uses. Some are more anonymous than others, some have very limited use cases while others are more general. We go more into the different types of cryptocurrencies in our article about fundamental value in crypto.\n\nBlockchain technology is what makes cryptocurrencies possible. Cryptocurrencies do not have a centralized form nor a physical manifestation, they exist only digitally on a blockchain with all transactions recorded in the same ledger.\n\nThe first cryptocurrency was Bitcoin, but it's not the only one out there; there are hundreds of other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, Monero etc.\n\nHow Do I Buy Cryptocurrency?\n\nIf you want to know how to buy cryptocurrency, there are quite a few different options out there.\n\n\n  You can buy crypto through an exchange such as Kraken and Poloniex.\n  Another way is to use your credit card and purchase the cryptocurrency at the market rate.\n  There are P2P markets for anonymous no-KYC purchases too.\n\n\nIf you're interested in buying crypto with your credit card, then you might check out Abra or TenXs services which let you purchase digital currency with your debit card and spend it on Visa/Mastercard credit cards respectively.\n\nHow Do I Store Cryptocurrency?\n\nCryptocurrency is not just a new form of payment anymore. It has now evolved to a whole new level and became a hotbed of activity that has been increasing every day.\n\nThanks to blockchain technology, it is now possible for anyone with an internet connection to freely exchange currency. No real need to depend on financial institutions such as banks or PayPal. And the use of cryptocurrency as digital assets has grown exponentially over the years.\n\nNo central regulation also means lots of individual responsibility, though. One should be cautious when choosing where to store their crypto holdings.\n\nMost exchanges are vulnerable to cyber attacks, most personal computers to viruses. The best solution would be storing your digital assets in hardware wallets which will provide an extra layer of security.\n\nThose are the so-called offline/cold storage wallets that come with higher levels of encryption.\n\nThe Pros &amp; Cons of Using Altcoins Over Fiat Currencies\n\nAs the final words, in case you are still on the fence about whether to buy cryptocurrency or not, let’s look at the pros and cons of using cryptocurrencies over fiat currencies.\n\n\n  Pros: Cryptocurrencies are decentralized, anonymous, and have no centralized issuer or government to control them. No central authority can take your cryptomoney away from you due to a ‘law’ or a policy.\n  Cons: Cryptocurrency transactions can be difficult due to their complexity and lack of trustworthiness. The storage asnd security of your cryptocurrency stash is your own personal responsibility.\n\n",

      title: "BTC to Doge Migration: The Fee Structure Policy on Dogecoin Core",
      content: "High transaction fees on major blockchains is one of the main issues for which small altcoins can provide a solution.\n\nBitcoin, being the first cryptocurrency, incurs high transaction fees. As a result, many traders have been migrating their coins from BTC to DOGE at least temporarily, whenever they need to make quick and cheap transfer of value between addresses.\n\nUsing a dino altcoin to move money between crypto exchanges is a long known practice that has been around at least since 2016.\n\nIn response to this practice, DOGE developers keep working towards making the coin compatible with that.\n\nDogecoin market does not stand on influencers\n\nAlthough big shots like Elon Musk show their support of the DOGE cryptocurrency, that on its own is not enough to support its market in the long run.\n\nTo make sure DOGE keeps a steady user base, the founders proposed a structured policy for its transaction fee to disincentivize spam and support the use of Dogecoin as a vehicle for fast and cheap transactions.\n\nThe original fee policy was first presented by Dogecoin founder Patrick Lodder in 2014. In 2018, a new policy took full effect to prevent users from spamming the on-chain transactions. Further updates were introduced in 2020 and 2021 in response to the changed market conditions.\n\nThis article explains the key points in Dogecoin’s fee structure policy and its impact on DOGE’s fundamental value.\n\nImpact of Recent Dogecoin's Price Surge on Transaction Fee\n\nAs you probably know, early in 2021 the Dogecoin price surged substantially. This along with increased trading and transfer volume had an effect on its transaction fee.\n\nIt was simply impossible to retain the old fee level of one Dogecoin per kilobyte of transaction data at the higher market price. Users kept trying to apply the old transaction fee which quickly clogged the mempool, leaving many transactions unverified.\n\nPatrick Lodder then proposed a policy to reduce the minimum relay fee to 0.0001 DOGE. That fee level would allow microtransactions to go through and at the same time promote the use of Dogecoin as a faster and cheaper vehicle to move Bitcoin.\n\nAt the same time, relay operators were allowed to set their own relay fees.\n\nThis increases the sovereignty of each node and decreases their dependency on the entire blockchain system. The policy ensures miners do not receive a sudden relay fee from a random node in the system. It reduces a miner's chance of connecting to a node even though they can tweak a customer's relay fee. Doge developers ensure a minimal relay fee is lesser than the recommended fee to ensure the sustainability of a low transaction fee.\n\nExchanges stepping in\n\nAmidst Dogecoin's new policy, exchanges are getting involved in creating a better trading experience through the fast and low costs of the transaction.\n\nEvonax said its platform ensures smooth transactions between parties without any delay.\n\n\"The average time it will take to get the confirmations will vary depending on the currency. The Bitcoin network operates with an average block time of 10 minutes. It means that on average, it will take up to 60 minutes to get the required confirmations, and the transaction is considered final and irreversible. Once the confirmations are completed, the Bitcoins will be exchanged and we will send the exchanged Dogecoins to the wallet you provide.\"\n\nThe proactive approach from crypto exchanges helped a lot to keep the market liquid and the DOGE cryptocurrency usable for fast transactions and easy exchanges between DOGE and BTC.\n\nDogecoin vs Litecoin\n\nIn the first months of 2021, high lending rates led investors to holding their coins on centralized platforms. In this way, investors to stayed ahead even in times when cryptocurrencies were losing value.\n\nEvery slump in crypto prices and trading activity is an opportunity to make changes in code and implement innovations though. With cryptocurrency like Dogecoin, it makes sense to reduce transaction fees because there’s a chance in it to beat DOGE’s closest competitors like Litecoin.\n\nAlthough every cryptocurrency is technically decentralized and uses the cryptography mechanism, its market valuations depends on the laws of supply and demand.\n\nSince the past free transacts were abused for spam, the current free structure policy aims to provide a reliable free transaction to increase users' investment chances by eliminating the network clog caused by spam.\n\nCryptocurrency enthusiasts observing this new development encourages investors to own a btc to doge wallet, flip the two currencies easily. Bitcoin’s drawbacks are reportedly still the same and therefore the market opportunity for a cheaper transactional cryptocurrency still exists.\n\nThanks to its network upgrades, Dogecoin has gained significant credibility as a coin to fill that demand, creating a promising future expectations.\n\nFinal words\n\nReducing blockchain transaction fees in altcoins already widely adopted for quick transactions between platforms builds users' confidence and reduces spam rates.\n\nDogecoin’s GitHub has also lately shown its support in allowing users to use alternative nodes and participate directly in keeping the network decentralized. This is not a bad way to build up a fundamental value of a cryptocurrency that is trying to profile as the cheaper and faster coin used as a vehicle for transactions.\n",

      content: "Automated trading can be a gold mine, if done well. There are traders who have a well set-up and backtested bot for scalping their favorite crypto market, and they run it whenever the market is ranging to save up their limited attention for more profitable situations.\n\nBut sometimes all you need is just a simple programmed buy order based on a few conditions, so that you don’t have to spend two months babysitting the charts when all you want to do is a spot buy on a decent bounce.\n\nWell, turns out that in 2022 some crypto trading platforms let you do that natively. Not only there is no need to write code, there is no need to get a third party tool either.\n\nDifferent trading platforms offer various degrees of complexity in what you can automate.\n\nWe’ll start from the most easy to use solution here.\n\nAlso read about these crypto programs if you’re interested to learn about some interesting affiliate networks.\n\nAuto Trader on Independent Reserve\n\nThe AutoTrader feature on the Aussie exchange Independent Reserve is very simple, but good rnough for most of your non-degen pursuits. Independent Reserve itself is an exchange built mainly for fast and legitimate onramp and offramp between cash and bitcoin or altcoins, not for daytrading and scalping.\n\nBut what it can do it does very well, and it will make your DCA or diversification work easier.\n\n\n\nThe AutoTrader is a free, user-friendly feature that currently has the three following strategies live:\n\n\n  Auto Buy on Deposit: Automatically buy or Dollar Cost Average (DCA) your way into bitcoin or altcoin once a fiat deposit is credited to your account.\n  Auto Basket for Diversifying: Automatically buy a weighted basket of cryptocurrencies once a fiat deposit is credited to your account.\n  Audo Schedule: Scheduled buying or selling of cryptocurrencies on a regular schedule. You can deposit once a month and then run the auto schedule to DCA parts of that deposit on regular intervals.\n\n\nYou will find the AutoTrader in your Accounts section at Independent Reserve. Supported fiat currencies are AUD, NZD, SGD and USD with fast deposits and withdrawals worldwide.\n\nSign up\n \nMore about Independent Reserve\n\nFTX Quant Zone\n\nFTX Quant Zone is where you can natively automate your crypto trading based on quite a lot of parameters.\n\nYou will need to set up your rules in pseudo-code, but you will find they are easy to work out. Nonetheless: The FTX quant zone gets confusing for portfolio management where you handle a lot of assets, and for trading on technical indicators.\n\n\n  Here are examples of third party trading bots for FTX\n\n\nVolume trading on FTX Quant Zone\n\nHere’s a simple rule that lets you buy a high volume breakout:\n\n\n\n\n  Another volume trading setup on FTX Quant Zone here in the VPVR trading strategy post\n\n\n\n\nTo add parameters, click the question mark icon next the rule field. You’ll get the manual with all of the rules that are currently implemented.\n\nMarket timing on FTX Quant Zone\n\nNot only you can program a trigger based on how much and on which volume a market moves within any time period of your choice, but you can also build your own stats if you want to.\n\nThere is a full library of basic arithmetic operators implemented. I am sure it will be painstaking if you’re not used to working with low level commands, but with a little bit of trial and error you can build triggers for basic TA metrics. You just need to google the formula on which they are built or copy and adjust it from a TradingView pine script.\n\n\n\nIt is worth pointing out that the market on which you set up your trigger does not need to be the same as the market on which you execute your order.\n\n\n  A simple example: Let’s say, you own BTC, you want to buy a BTCUSD bounce but you also want to limit your potential losses in case you’re wrong. In this case you could set up a trigger on the spot market and direct it to act on BTC perpetual swap with a stop loss, or you can direct it to buy a call option. FTX global does support options trading.\n  A market timing example: FTX provides several basket indices to work with: You can trade on the comparison of a single market vs an index. More on that in market timing article.\n  You could also work out a relationship between crypto and stocks, and direct the action to one of FTX’s tokenized stock markets…Tons of possibilities here.\n\n\nSign up (5% discount)\n \nMore about FTX (US and Global)\n\nBitfinex\n\nBitfinex currently does not offer an automation tool for trading.

      title: "The Effects of crypto crackdown and bans on crypto betting",
      content: "The act of gambling via the internet, as the name indicates, includes the firmly established niche of crypto betting. To bet, you can use a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Ripple instead of legacy payment methods like a debit/credit card or an e-wallet. Other than that, crypto betting sites function the same as any other betting platforms. You will gain access to popular games such as Baccarat Slots Video Poker Roulette Blackjack.\n\nBut, given the sharp decline in cryptocurrencies and the bans enforced by several nations on cryptocurrencies, how has crypto betting fared? This article will assist us in determining how much the restrictions and economic downturn of cryptocurrency have impacted Bitcoin betting sites.\n\nA China Case Study\n\nThe government's toughest anti-cryptocurrency effort since 2017 has largely unconcerned China investors, highlighting Beijing's challenge to curb the speculative growth of digital assets.\n\nAs domestic exchanges have been banned by the Chinese in 2017, knee-jerk selling has been replaying a slow comeback on over-the-counter marketplaces. The exchange rate between the China yuan and the stable coin Tether collapsed as much as 4.4% after official warnings earlier but has regained more than half of the loss subsequently, according to Feixiaohao, the Chinese version of CoinMarketCap. In the course of six months, the Communist Party has increased its concerns about the risk of fraud, money laundering, and trading losses by regular investors following a frenetic development of bitcoin and other tokening.\n\nChina is intensifying its election campaign. However, since local OTC and peer-to-peer transactions are difficult to track, authorities will have difficulty imposing a comprehensive ban. Concerns over a fall in Chinese purchasing power led to the only about $1 trillion digital ramp-ups in mid-May, so worldwide crypto enthusiasts might be comfortable in doing so.\n\nA Redditor who claims to be a consultant in Shanghai says, \"I don't care\" about losses or crackdown. Since 2017, he claims to have invested in cryptocurrencies and claims to have lost 11 million dollars over three days in the current sales. \"To me, the profits I have made in a previous couple of months are returned,\" he explains. \"The next 10 to 20 years I'm watching.\" Domestic investors controlled around 7 percent of world Bitcoin and accounted for over 80 percent of trading in accordance with state media before China banned crypto exchanges in 2017.\n\nChinese Crypto Turned to OTC\n\nWhile it is difficult to quantify these numbers today because of the exchange restriction, China's investment in the crypto sector is widely considered to have a large presence on local OTC platforms and offshore venues that they access through virtual private networks. The Chinese Government cannot detect domestic yuan and digital coin trades, as they usually take place in two phases.\n\nThe first happens on OTC platforms, such as Huobi and OKEx, allowing traders to publish offers and offerings. When the parties agree that a price would be paid, the purchaser would send yuan to the seller via a separate payment channel running by his bank or a fintech company such as Ant Group Co. After the OTC platform maintains them in check until the payment of the yuan is cleared, digital coins are then relayed to the buyer.\n\nUsing the OTC process in China, regulators are often unable to connect one transaction to another.\n\nThere is a minimal threat of large-scale capital outflows, given China's domestic banking system fully supports the yuan leg of agreements. But the government has taken a caution against cryptocurrencies by financial institutions and private investors.\n\nRegulators warned Chinese banks and payment firms earlier this month to detect and obstruct suspicious transactions and to regularly breach banking laws by enabling cryptocurrency sales. The Chinese State Council pledged to \"resolutely\" avoid financial hazards and to undermine bitcoin trade and mining. Political authorities might be keen to avoid any major market disturbances on the heavily charged centenary of the ruling Communist Party on 1 July.\n\nThe Mining and Trading Crackdown\n\nHuobi stated it stopped its mining services in mainland China and, as a consequence of the government statement, reduced future contracts, and leveraged investment products on certain markets.\n\nThe firm does not know whether its OTC platform is being shut down. According to a source aware of the issue, Chinese authorities have refused to declare trafficking illegal, but a public safety agency would be involved in the attack because some of the activities had been suspected of supporting money laundering and terrorist financing. Police of Beijing issued written warnings about potential cryptocurrency hazards.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg's warning, anybody \"in fear who has difficulty distinguishing or who doesn't know what to do\" should contact the local police.\n\nCertain investor in cryptocurrency have made unverified claims on social media that local governments have been calling recently with warnings against investment in cryptocurrency. Local officials pushed him to sell his assets and remove the app from his phone, according to the investor.\n\nPast crackdowns as a template\n\nChinese officials view the fact that they have managed to clean up the peer-to-peer lending sector a few years ago as a template for their bitcoin response, according some. In the past, the government reorganised the P2P lending industry after a wave of frauds and defaults, which led to suicide and large demonstrations.\n\nThe huge price fluctuations of cryptocurrencies have had their influence already. Local media reports that following a massive bitcoin wager loss in June of 20 million yuan ($3.1 million), a Chinese man from the eastern city of Dalian murdered his three-year-old daughter and tried to commit suicide together with his wife.\n\nBased on the word of mouth in the sports betting community, we can assume confidently that a substantial shift in use of gambling platforms has been the result of the government's economic crackdown on cryptocurrencies over the world. Nonetheless, gamers and traders still seek methods to exploit any current market situation to better their financial condition without the government officials discovering it.\n",

      content: "So, DeFi trading. It sounds almost absurd, the noisiest thing about DeFi are the various kinds of yield farming products.\n\nThe whole business of liquidity provision relies on the existence of a market that demands the liquidity though. Even now already traditional network staking relies on the existence of transaction activity.\n\nIn this ScriptSpotlight we will look at pine scripts for monitoring of this quieter part of DeFi. Some are already out there thanks to the TradingView community.\n\nWe give you three ideas in this Script Spotlight:\n\n\n  DeFi dominance script\n  Today’s liquidity for single glance volume overview\n  DeFi basket indexes for market timing\n\n\n\n\nDeFi Dominance and Altseason Tracking\n\nTrader Hemlocked created this script for people to be able to track AltSeason.\n\nThis simple but clever comparison script pulls price and marketcap data of various cryptocurrencies and divides them into three categories.\n\nThe coins are grouped based on the type of their fundamental value proposition:\n\n\n  Cryptocurrencies that store value: BTC, BCH, XMR...\n  Cryptocurrencies that generate value through DeFi: ETH, TRX, UNI, ADA, BNB...\n  Meme cryptocurrencies like DOGE\n\n\nTransforming these three categories into a single ticker each gives a quick overview of where is most of the market’s money located at any moment.\n\n\n\nThe script is over two weeks old now, which obviously makes it desperately out of date.\n\nIt disregards SHIB and many other memecoin projects of the week.\n\nBut the pine code is so simple that I’m sure everyone will be able to make adjustments as needed. Take a look:\n\n\n  Link to script\n\n\n\n\nLiquidity Single-Glance Tool\n\nIn 2021 we have DeFi vapourware and dog money, it was ICO shitcoins a few years back, yada yada, get out of those in time.\n\nHere is a super simple TradingView tool that will give you today’s volume as compared to the average daily volume.\n\nVolume trading is a discipline in itself, but this handy single-glance tool is free (unlike VPVR) and gives you the gist in just a second.\n\n\n  Link to script\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeFi Indexes: Study\n\nBasket indexes are used as a technical tool for market timing strategies. There is already a whole bunch of basket products that group top DeFi markets into a single ticker.\n\nDPI Index\n\nA good basket index is the DeFi Pulse Index (DPI) that monitors Uniswap, AAVE, Compound, Sushi and other Ethereum token valuations. This index is a market-cap weighted one. It is reasonably managed by an independent entity, rebalanced in the last week of each month.\n\nDPI can be traded on DEXes like Uniswap, Sushiswap and Honeyswap, but custodial trading platform offer their own baskets.\n\nNotably, FTX has a perpetual swap of a DeFi basket that is not DPI, and Binance has their own one too. These differ quite a bit from the independent DPI, which can bring opportunities.\n\nTradingView member BilzerianCandle created a set of studies to compare these. The actual scripts are outdated, do not copypaste them: They use an old composition of DPI that has been changed since. The idea is still useful as a study and easy to replicate in any multi-chart layout as DPI is now available as its own ticker on TradingView.\n\n\n  Currently available DeFi baskets: DPI, DEFIPERP (FTX), DEFIUSDTPERP (Binance), PIPT, sDEFI.\n  Link to the outdated idea for inspiration\n\n\n\n",

      content: "Until DeFi came around, our only way to generate income from crypto holdings was either active trading or margin lending to other traders.\n\nDeFi and PoS changed that…Kind of.\n\nNeither yield farming nor staking are super groundbreakingly new concepts.\n\n\n  \n    Yield farming\n\n    …is just a way of providing liquidity to traders.\n  \n\n\nAs a yield farmer, you depend on active trading of your token.\n\n\n  Cold Staking\n\n\n… is just a way of automated lending to the whole network.\n\nAs a staker, you get rewarded for confirming transactions, you depend on the blockchain being active.\n\nIn this blog we’ll focus on yield farming in 2022.\n\nNow that so many services around cold staking and yield farming developed, it is quite easy for everyone to earn some extra income from their crypto.\n\nThat also means that the actual yields got much lower, because the market is now more saturated. In line with that, we outline a way to stay up do date with the latest markets to snatch early opportunities.\n\nBest Yield Farming Platforms\n\nTo start off, here’s a list of some of the currently popular yield farming platforms. And a little explanation of how to navigate the space to maximize your yields.\n\nOG yield farming platforms and more successful clones\n\n\n  \n    Uniswap\n\n    Chains: Ethereum, Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum\n\n    In v3 there have been a lot of changes to the yield farming protocol. Read how to provide liquidity using the new Advanced functions.\n  \n  \n    Curve.Finance\n\n    Chains: Ethereum, Polygon, AAVE\n\n    The Curve is a DAO that launched on ETH in August 2020. Curve allows liquidity providers to take decisions on adding new pools, changing pool parameters, adding CRV incentives and other aspects of the Curve protocol.\n\n    \n  \n  \n    1inch\n  \n\n\nChains: Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum\n\n1inch is an aggregator of large amount of DeFi markets, either on ETH or on BSC or some of the newly added blockchains. Only launched in summer 2021, it got quite a traction and v2 is in the works.\n\n\n  \n    SushiSwap\n\n    Chains: Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum and many others\n\n    SushiSwap supports the largest number of different blockchains to use to trade and yield from tokens.\n\n    In addition to yield farming, Sushi Swap now offers classic lending without automated-market-maker, which means no impermanent loss. Some of the rates are interesting.\n\n    \n  \n  \n    PancakeSwap\n\n    Chains: Binance Smart Chain\n\n    PancakeSwap did not add support to other chains, it’s still only BSC. It did add NFT trading though, which keeps people interested.\n  \n\n\nSmaller clones\n\n\n  CoinSwap BSC\n  PooCoin BSC, MATIC, KCC\n  BakerySwap BSC (focused on NFTs)\n\n\nWhy Yield Farming paid so much (in the beginning)\n\nYield farming is the new DeFi type of lending where alt-coiners have been generating crazy returns until midway through the year 2020 or so.\n\nLet’s explain in broad strokes how it earning yields works.\n\n\n  In yield farming, you lend your money to a trading platform with automated market-making (AMM) system.\n  DeFi trading platforms rely on their liquidity being crowd-sourced like this.\n  Because of that reliance they will pay a lot to get their liquidity in. Without it, there could be no trading.\n  The demand side: The more popular the platform gets, the more liquidity it demands, the more you can earn from providing it.\n  The supply side: The more people start providing coins to generate yields, the higher the supply of the coin, which decreased yields as the demand is met.\n\n\nYield Farming Got Crowded\n\nClearly, if you want to keep earning as much as you can from your farming, you need to keep track of two things:\n\n\n  which DeFi platforms people currently trade on.\n  which coins that have some hype around them are getting newly listed there.\n\n\nYour opportunity is on any platform where traders want to trade and where there is not enough liquidity to meet that demand.\n\nSo far, it’s still not one-and-done. The top platform is the one that (still, despite regulations) has the highest volume - Binance. Token traders are opportunistic and move between platforms quite a lot, though.\n\nWhy DeFi traders move platforms a lot\n\nWhy will an alt coin trader switch exchanges? Usually it’s one of the two following reasons:\n\n\n  The fees are too high and they want to move from ETH to the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) or some other novel chain.\n  The shitcoin of the week is not yet listed on their old exchange and they want to trade it.\n\n\nIf you are a DeFi liquidity provider, you will need to know where the traders flock and follow them.\n\nOn decentralized exchanges, you don’t even need to make an account. You simply plug in a wallet like Metamask and trade directly from it. That’s one thing that makes it so easy to switch between DEX platforms.\n\nOnce a trader stops liking their DeFi exchange, they might do a quick skim through Reddit to see where else people are trading, and go plug your wallet to the new place.\n\nYield Farming Strategy for 2022\n\nIf you want to know about new DeFi markets to provide liquidity to, go to the same places where traders go.\n\n\n  \n    Shill exchanges where coins get shill\n\n    Here’s a couple of forums where shills post about the latest DEXes, alt coins and NFTs:\n\n    \n      r/cryptomoonshot\n      r/altcointrader\n      r/cardanonfts\n    \n\n    Alternatively, you need to make sure they hear about the exchange you work on and get curious. That is why there are so many DeFi shills everywhere these days.\n  \n  \n    Look for clones of current yield farming platforms\n\n    New decentralized and DeFi swaps crop up all the time. They are almost never written from scratch. In almost all cases, they are a clone of a different DeFi swap.\n\n    So, you can get ahead if you go to GitHub and search for Uniswap clone, Sushiswap clone, Yearn finance clone…Anyone can make their own clone and try to get the traders in.\n\n    Here is a list of the more OG places traders still talk about a lot. You can use them as a starting point for your searches:\n\n    \n      \n        \n          DEX\n          Chain\n          What draws the traders in\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Uniswap\n          ETH, MATIC…\n          Advanced functions in liquidity provision\n        \n        \n          Curve.Finance\n          Ethereum\n          Low fees and minimum slippage\n        \n        \n          SushiSwap\n          Ethereum\n          Network effect at this point\n        \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    Look for yield farming platforms with rising volume\n\n    Two words: Dune Analytics.\n\n    NFT traders will find the data valuable, too.\n\n    \n  \n\n\nBottom Line\n\nMaybe one day the DeFi market will mature and vast majority of people will have the same go-to DEX for yield farming. But for now, your yield will change wildly from platform to platform.\n",

      content: "The increasing popularity of cryptocurrency has led to an unprecedented shake-up in the global financial industry over the past decade. It was only in 2009 that Bitcoin — the first decentralized digital coin — was created, its supporters lauding the arrival of a currency not regulated by any one government body.\n\nBitcoin has been a hugely successful venture, and now accounts for USD$6 billion’s worth of online transactions occurring daily. There are more than 40 million crypto users globally; the success of Bitcoin has spurred an array of alternative cryptocurrencies known as altcoins.)\n\nPolkadot and Cardano are just two of the newer digital currencies available. Reputable resources can provide a list of Australian exchanges to buy altcoins on, but how can you tell which one is likely to reign supreme in 2021?\n\nWhat is cryptocurrency?\n\nBefore comparing altcoins, it’s important to understand what cryptocurrency is, and how it can be used. At its core, crypto is digital money which is not regulated by any one government entity, and therefore can be used in more than 100 countries globally.\n\nThere are more than 5,000 types of digital coin currently available, Polkadot and Cardano being just two of these.\n\nDigital currency can be gained through mining, and can also be purchased on reputable exchange sites. Some users buy cryptocurrency in order to diversify their investment portfolios, and some utilize staking strategies to make passive income by holding various digital currency. The intended purpose of digital coin is for owners to use it as real currency to buy goods and services; many businesses worldwide now accept Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as payment methods.\n\nAbout Cardano\n\nCardano’s boost in popularity has been largely influenced by its impressive scalability when compared to popular currencies Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nBitcoin is capable of processing seven transactions per second, with Ethereum performing 15, which may not be sufficient for some large-scale users. Cardano has improved their technology to the point where it can comfortably handle thousands of transactions per second, breezing past the competition in this regard.\n\nCardano was founded by Charles Hoskinson, who is also the co-founder of Ethereum. If its recent value increase is any indication, Cardano is well on its way to becoming a cryptocurrency powerhouse; the digital coin ended 2020 valued at USD$0.18, and has since rallied by more than 500%.\n\nThe first ever crypto blockchain to be founded on peer-reviewed research, the platform requires transaction validators to stake ADA coin (the name of the Cardano currency coin).\n\nCardano is also now 100% decentralized, an important milestone in making the platform less vulnerable to attacks and other risks. Decentralization is an attractive prospect for investors, and we may see this feature continue to improve the perceived value of the currency this year. The ADA coin is currently available to trade on some large exchange sites, making it available to a wide range of budding investors.\n\nPotential drawbacks to the Cardano cryptocurrency include the fact that it does not support smart contracts at this point in time, and it does not have an NFT token (although this is rumored to be in the works.)\n\nAbout Polkadot\n\nPolkadot is currently among the top five cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, and has provided a return on investment of 89.3% since its launch.\n\nPolkadot uses a virtual coin referred to as DOT, which is able to be used by the owner for bonding or staking. The Polkadot system allows trusted validators to mine on the platform, and features a parallel processing blockchain ability, which allows individual blockchains to operate in tandem with other parachains.\n\nInterestingly, like Cardano, Polkadot was created by a co-founder of Ethereum: Gavin Wood.\n\nRecent announcements by Polkadot to launch the Tether coin on their network have piqued the interest of digital coin investors. Although no launch date has been set, this integration will be welcome news for those running projects requiring stable coins across multiple networks; if this launch provides the intended functionality, it could be a very attractive prospect for investors who value stability and affordability.\n\nOne major selling point for Polkadot is its low transaction fee structure; providing a reduced-cost service could help to give Polkadot a boost among everyday crypto users.\n\nWhich cryptocurrency should I invest in?\n\nWhile various market experts may speculate on which of these digital currencies will outperform the other in 2021, there are no guarantees when it comes to crypto investment. Both Polkadot and Cardano have strong pedigrees, thanks to their founders’ prior experience in creating popular digital coins; however, each one is likely to appeal to a different type of investor.\n\nPolkadot is expected to become popular among investors with a vested interest in stability, and projects requiring multiple networks; Cardano’s incredible transactions-per-second capability may put it in strong favor among larger traders, who value raw processing power.\n\nCryptocurrency trading tips\n\nWhichever digital currency you decide to invest in, you should be aware of some basic trading tips:\n\n\n  \n    Use a reputable exchange site. There are more than 300 cryptocurrency exchanges operating globally; ensuring that you use one that’s well-regarded is critical to protect your investment. You should also check to make sure that the exchange site you’re using is registered to operate in your country; resources such as Crypto Head can help you to do your due diligence in this regard.\n  \n  \n    Stay updated on the trends. While past performance or current hype may not be a solid indicator of future success, staying on top of industry speculation and activity can help you to make informed investment decisions. Bitcoin tycoon Mike Novogratz believes the digitization of everything and the global pandemic are accelerating the cryptocurrency industry; read up on what leaders in your area think and are saying about digital currency.\n  \n  \n    Diversify your investments. A good rule of thumb when it comes to investing, is to never put all your eggs in one basket. Consider whether you hold assets in stocks and property already; crypto could be a good addition to your current portfolio. If you have purchased one form of digital currency, consider branching out and adding some different forms of digital coin to your online holdings.\n  \n\n\nConclusion\n\nThe world is rapidly turning toward digital solutions in many areas of our lives, and money is no exception; for the foreseeable future, cryptocurrency is here to stay. By staying up to date on industry speculation and thoroughly researching your options, budding investors could make smarter decisions for their portfolios.\n\nWhile Cardano and Polkadot are relatively new to the cryptocurrency game, they both have significant benefits that could see them perform very well long-term. These are certainly two digital currencies to watch in 2021.\n",

      title: "How to read option charts: Market sentiment analysis based on crypto derivatives",
      content: "Options are underused on the crypto markets, at least for now.\n\nOption markets have been getting more attention recently, as a result of the GME action. The GME pump was actually the (option-based) gamma squeeze, not a regular spot market short squeeze.\n\nUsing options for market analysis\n\nThere are interesting, non-speculative uses for options in the crypto space.\n\n\n  You can use options instead of a stop-loss order for instance. Not a bad idea if you trade with leverage on exchanges that crash under heavy load, like Kraken or Coinbase or Binance.\n  Options can be used for hedging and to manage your risks. When used well, options limit the amount of money put to risk better than any futures or spot position.\n\n\nHowever, this is a blog about technical analysis for the crypto markets. We’ll keep it focused around the use of options for analysis.\n\nThis article will explain how to use the option markets to look at market sentiment and whale activity. It is written for people who never traded options and perhaps don’t even want to. The point is really just to understand what goes on in the option charts.\n\nWe won’t go into “the greeks” and other technical stuff, but there is a list of resources at the bottom.\n\nOptions basics\n\nOptions are a derivative, a financial instrument based on an underlying asset. Crypto options are based on cryptoassets - typically bitcoin, less often ethereum and other altcoins.\n\nAn option contract gives its owner the option to make a trade with the underlying asset for a price agreed in advance (the strike price). The date when the trade is meant to happen is also agreed in advance (the expiration date).\n\nCalls and Puts explained\n\n\n  Buying a call option means getting the option to buy the asset for strike price at expiration date. The call option is making money if the spot price is above the strike price, because you’re getting the asset cheaper than it currently trades.\n  Buying a put option means getting the option to sell the asset for strike price at expiration date. The put option is making money if the spot price is below the strike price, because you’re selling the asset dearer than it currently trades.\n\n\nOn crypto markets, that “optional” final trade happens always and traders get paid out in crypto. For traders who use options to speculate, biggest share of their profit or loss will come from the difference between the strike price and the spot price of the asset when the final trade executes.\n\nThere are other ways to yield profit or information from options, though.\n\nPremium\n\nBuying an option costs. There are other fees as well, but for the purposes of analysis you only need to know that there is a one-off fee for buying an option contract, and that this fee goes to the seller of the contract.\n\nThe price of the contract (the premium) changes based on supply/demand logic, just like any other market would. That is where market sentiment is reflected.\n\nThis was the bare minimum you need to know if you just want to understand what is happening on the options markets.\n\nBasic options chart cheatsheet\n\n\n\nDownload the cheatsheet in full resolution from here\n\nOption chart from Deribit options exchange.\n\nHow to read options charts\n\nSkew\n\nThe way option’s premium changes based on the option’s strike price is called skew.\n\nIf the price for buying an options contract was the same for every strike price, that would be called flat skew. Flat skew is unlikely to happen. There is supply and demand in play, and supply and demand are skewed by the prevailing bias.\n\nSkew tells you whether the market, in total, puts more money into the view that the underlying asset is underpriced, or into the view that it is overpriced.\n\nArguably following the actual money is a better information than getting your sentiment from social media. As we all know, often the smaller fishes make sure they are heard the most.\n\nSkew on legacy vs crypto markets\n\nOn stock markets, call options are cheap and put options are expensive. There is a large demand for put options because stock holders use them to hedge against falling price of the stock they hold.\n\nThe demand for call options is not matching it, which results in the skew.\n\nOn crypto markets, traders in general have some expectations to the upside. There is some hedging activity but all in all call options are relatively expensive due to the high demand.\n\nEven “out of the money” calls are more expensive in crypto than they would be on legacy markets. (Out of money call is a contract to buy the asset at a price that is even higher than the current spot price.)\n\nIf the skew changes, it shows an important sentiment shift on the market. The skew is a good sentiment indicator - it is backed by actual money and it’s very difficult to paint it.\n\nWhale watching on option markets\n\nCrypto options are a market small enough for Deribit Insights still highlighting individual whale positions on Twitter. You can follow significant trades on any market, sure. But only options make it possible to speculate on very specific targets.\n\nHere is one large bitcoin options trader letting himself be heard that he expects BTCUSD to range for the next 5 days: One ‘Fund’ logically decided the range was set for the next week, selling 5th Feb 28k Put 40+42k Call Strangles (Selling both) x800\n\nIf you typed those numbers into the position builder spreadsheet linked in resources, you’d get the following chart.\n\n\n\nThe chart shows that the position of that ‘found’ would earn money as long as BTCUSD would be between ~35k and ~48k on 5th February. The maximum profit would have been for spot price around 40k.\n\nThe position was large enough to move the options market, that’s why it was highlighted in the tweet. Needless to say, it ended up making money.\n\n\n\nYou will not get this level of accuracy from sentiment analysis of social media posts. And I’m not even taking into account that your average crypto-redditor hardly has any money in crypto.\n\nFair warning\n\nThis is just another method for technical analysis, based on what other traders anticipate. There is no guarantee any of that activity is in touch with reality at all.\n\nIf you made it this far though, chances are it will be easy enough for you to learn to read the option markets and use that information as a piece in the puzzle.\n\nNot many people will give it the time it needs, which is always a good thing for a trader.\n\nWhat follows now is a list of typical participants on the crypto option markets to give you an idea of what you’ll be looking at.\n\nWho are the crypto option markets participants?\n\nThe following list sums up the most typical entities on crypto options market, including the positions they like to trade.\n\n\n  Directional funds, or whales\n\n\nDirectional funds are large crypto holders who open simple positions to express their views on where the spot price will go. These “funds” trade options for speculative profits.\n\nTypical positions expressing the “fund’s” views:\n\n  buying calls (bullish)\n  selling puts (bullish)\n  buying asset on spot and buying puts as a hedge (bullish)\n  shorting futures and buying calls as a stop loss (bearish)\n  multi-leg option constructs that limit risks (uncertainty)\n\n\n\n  Yield enhancement traders\n\n\nYield enhancing traders in crypto options markets are larger spot crypto holders who use a lot of hedged and arbitrage strategies. They are trading to generate yield from their spot holdings but without explicitly speculating on the direction of the future price movements.\n\nTypical yield enhancing positions:\n\n  cash &amp; carry arbitrage and other strategies that collect the premium regardless of how the spot price moves\n  strangles and other option constructs that make money when the spot price leaves a trading range to either direction\n  covered calls, which is a low risk strategy of earning income from an asset you already own by selling its call options\n\n\n\n  Bitcoin Miners\n\n\nMiners are a category of option markets participants specific to bitcoin.\n\nTheir activity can be focused on yield generation or hedging:\n\n  yield collection on the bitcoin they hold and pay the bills of their mining operation\n  hedging through buying put options as a protection against bitcoin price drop\n\n\n\n  Volatility funds\n\n\nVolatility traders are among the more technical options traders. They trade speculating on the volatility of the spot market, not its direction.\n\n\n  Market makers\n\n\nMarket makers provide liquidity. As in other markets, they will get in at extreme prices and out with a small profit, making this activity a numbers game.\n\nAn oversimplified example:\n\n  market maker buys option contracts when they are extremely underpriced just after a whale sold a lot of them\n  then the market maker will offer those contracts for sale a little less underpriced, collecting the difference\n\n\n\n  Retail\n\n\nLast but not least, retail is the diverse and splintered group of small traders.\n\nEven though retail traders are usually not coordinated, they will often trade in agreement based on influential news or common sentiment. Technical analysis itself can be a tool generating crowd agreement.\n\nWhen the retail is in agreement, market sentiment is most clearly visible but it is also the good time to start looking for large traders who trade in the opposite direction.\n\nResources\n\nFor the technical basics of option markets:\n\nBrief but pretty complete intro to technicals of the option markets is hanging on the Twitter profile of Tony Stewart @pelioncap who is a pro trader with long experience on legacy and crypto option markets. The PDF link below goes to a document compiled from that Twitter thread (which has nearly 100 chained tweets!)\n\nTony Stewart's options intro in PDF\n\nFor the market analysis:\n\n\n  Deribit Options flow is a weekly-ish blog series at Deribit that explores exactly the sentiments that can be read out of the changes in options pricing on the BTC options markets.\n  Deribit Insights on Twitter get tweet threads also focusing on sentiments on the options market. They even highlight individual positions, if they are big enough.\n  Options position builder is a Google spreadsheet that you will need to read the above two links, unless you are a seasoned options trader. The position builder will chart and visualize the positions reported in the option flow and Deribit insights above.\n\n",

      title: "What’s Better For Betting Sites: Ethereum or Bitcoin?",
      content: "Ethereum betting sites are competing with Bitcoin betting sites, but which one is better for you?\n\nBitcoin has some pros over Ethereum, and vice versa. Is there one factor that might be the deal-breaker in general? Or is there one that might be specifically better for you?\n\nLet’s take a look.\n\nBetting with Ethereum\n\nA solid Forbes article explains the 2021 rise of Ethereum’s price as well as the mechanisms behind Ethereum itself.\n\n\n  “Ethereum began a long-awaited upgrade designed to improve scalability and security. It will see the Ethereum network move from the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus algorithm to the proof-of-stake (PoS) algorithm.”\n\n\nThe move from PoW to PoS essentially means that those who receive Ethereum’s ether tokens as a reward for maintaining the network will now not be needed anymore.\n\nEthereum’s network upgrade optimizes the settlement of transactions on Ethereum and users who want to contribute to network security will instead of mining now be able to deposit their tokens to secure the network and earn rewards for staking them.\n\nThis much-anticipated launch of Ethereum 2.0, along with the booming DeFi market that’s almost entirely built on top of Ethereum’s blockchain, has caused developers to pile onto the network.\n\nDo these affect betting with Ethereum?\n\nVolatility\n\nAs for the ether’s price point, they surely do.\n\nIf you deposit crypto to a betting site, the site will convert the Ethereum to dollars or other onsite casino tokens which you then use to play. When you’re ready to withdraw, the money will be converted back to Ethereum.\n\nThe problem with Ethereum’s price volatility is that betting apps work with fiat value of ether. Due to volatility, you can deposit Ethereum, play for a while and even if you win, still walk out with less fiat than you would have if you’d simply held onto the Ethereum in the first place.\n\nThen again, the price action could go the other way. You might deposit Ethereum, play for a while, and then as you withdraw (and the app converts your fiat winnings back to Ethereum), you might get more Ethereum than you put in.\n\nThe point to be aware of here is that the price of Ethereum is more volatile than most other cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin.\n\nSpeed\n\nThe speed of transferring funds using Ethereum is faster than Bitcoin.\n\nTransferring funds with Bitcoin takes an average of ten to thirty minutes. Ethereum slashes this transaction time down to a handful of minutes.\n\nIf speed is important to you – such as wanting to fund your account or withdraw your winnings fast – then you might want to consider using Ethereum gambling sites.\n\nBetting with Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin is the king of cryptocurrencies for a reason.\n\nBitcoin has been around longer and its network is more stable than Ethereum’s.\n\nSecurity\n\nOne of the benefits related to the network stability is that the Bitcoin network is more secure than Ethereum. Bitcoin mining network spans the whole globe. The possibility of a 51% attack on the Bitcoin blockchain is near impossible.\n\nEthereum’s mining network was also vast. However, this is changing with the recently introduced Ethereum 2.0 upgrade – which aims to slowly decrease the blockchain’s reliance on physical miners and put more on the backs of people who stack Ethereum.\n\nThis move is great for the environment. It limits the use of electricity to secure the Ethereum blockchain. However, Ethereum 2.0 and staking in general is a new technology that’s untested on this scale.\n\nIt might lead to new hacks and create previously unknown vectors of influence.\n\nLongevity\n\nBitcoin may outlast Ethereum.\n\nIt’s a tough possibility to think about, but it’s a real possibility.\n\nEthereum aims to be a “world computer” but its transaction speeds lag behind other cryptocurrencies that have risen up to compete with it.\n\nBitcoin, on the other hand, has perfectly established itself as a form of a digital store of value. Its code is simple and its blockchain is massive. No other cryptocurrencies have been able to compete.\n\nWhen you start betting with crypto on betting sites, keep Bitcoin’s longevity in mind. Especially if you’re a VIP or long time player who does not pull funds out for a while. Bitcoin will be almost definitely around in a few years time, Ethereum might have failed like most other altcoins in the meantime.\n\nOr Perhaps You Don’t Need to Choose\n\nFortunately, many of the top betting sites don’t make you choose between using Ethereum or Bitcoin.\n\nYou can use Ethereum or you can use Bitcoin.\n\nIf you want to deposit or withdraw faster, use Ethereum.\n\nIf you want safety in your deposits or withdrawals, use Bitcoin.\n\nIt also depends on which blockchain you’re more comfortable using. Make sure you also have wallets that are secure. And make sure the site you choose keeps your deposited crypto safe through cold wallets that are multi-signature secured.\n\nEither way, crypto betting sites surely have an edge over traditional betting sites. So if you’re not using a crypto betting site, then perhaps now is the time to experiment with it and see if crypto betting is for you.\n\nStay safe and have fun!\n",

      title: "OBV: On-Balance Volume Divergence Crypto Strategies",
      content: "In this ScriptSpotlight:\n\n\n  Why OBV works\n  OBV Oscillator Tradingview Script Review\n\n\nIf you are looking for a more short timeframe type of volume indicator, you should probably read the ScriptSpotlight on Volume Profile (free) scripts from TradingView and Cryptowatch.\n\nOn Balance Volume (OBV)\n\nOn Balance Volume is a technical analysis indicator best known from the stock market. Swing traders use OBV to identify periods of quiet accumulation.\n\nDuring such times, entities dubbed “smart money” are buying up the asset in question, but their activity has minimal effect on price.\n\nTraders who are able to use OBV, Wyckoff method or fundamental analysis to discover the “smart money” accumulation is happening can choose to enter the market at a better entry price than breakout traders.\n\nThere is also the use of OBV to improve your exit price or minimize the risk of drawdowns. Traders who spot a bearish OBV divergence can sell as the “smart money” starts selling into retail, typically all the while the news sites and social media are still insanely bullish.\n\nHow OBV works\n\nOn Balance Volume is a way to graphically express the old stock market wisdom: Volume precedes price action.\n\nThe OBV chart is a single line that changes proportionally to the last period’s volume.\n\n\n  Current close price is below last close price (Price goes down): We subtract current traded volume from OBV (OBV goes down)\n  Current close price is above last close price (Price goes up): We add current traded volume to OBV (OBV goes up)\n\n\nHow to use OBV in crypto trading\n\nLooking for smart money accumulation, we want to see only small increases in price but large volumes and therefore large changes in OBV.\n\nOn the chart, smart money accumulation will show as a divergence of OBV vs price.\n\nOBV Divergence Types\n\nOBV follows the same divergence patterns as RSI divergence:\n\n\n  Bullish OBV divergence: OBV bottoms out, making higher low, on continually falling price\n  Bearish OBV divergence: OBV tops out, making a lower high, on continually rising price\n\n\nGet OBV on TradingView\n\nOBV Divergence on TradingView\n\nThere is plenty of OBV scripts in the TradingView library.\n\nHere’s one version that is modified precisely to bring up divergences: OBV Oscillator.\n\nThe script calculates the regular OBV, as explained above…\n\nsrc = close\nobv(src) =&gt; cum(change(src) &gt; 0 ? volume : change(src) &lt; 0 ? -volume : 0*volume)\n# new obv = if close went up then add volume,\n#           if close went down then subtract volume,\n#           else leave old obv\n\n\n…and then it makes it into an oscillator by subtracting its own exponential moving average from itself:\n\nobv_osc = (obv(src) - ema(obv(src),length))\n\n\nThis brings up weaker divergences on short time frames that would not always show up on regular OBV.\n\nFull script code\n\nDoes it work?\n\nYes.\n\nOn shorter timeframes (1H-4H), the oscillator does bring up divergence that the plain OBV does not yet show.\n\nBelow is a December 2020 BTCUSD in 2H timeframe.\n\nOn the left, there is a clear bearish divergence that is far more pronounced with the oscillator. Plain OBV shows it as well, just much more shallower.\n\nLater on, more to the right, there is another bearish divergence that is not shown on plain OBV at all.\n\nWith this weaker divergence you could argue that the price stayed more or less flat anyway, and so this div might not be worth the attention anyway.\n\n\n\nWhen in doubt, zoom out: Let’s take a look at the same situation on a higher timeframe then.\n\nBelow is BTCUSD in 4H.\n\nThe divergence highlighted on 2H is still there (yellow), and moreover it is now a part of a larger divergence (pink).\n\nThe larger div is not shown in plain OBV.\n\n\n\nOn the classic 1D chart, the differences between OBV oscillator and plain OBV vanish.\n\nIt is still worth noting that the oscillator will paint the line bright red to scream at you at that THIS IS NOT GOOD in case you’d prefer to ignore that…which you still kind of could with plain OBV.\n\n\n\nThis could be one of the three-pushes patterns but I’ll leave the full analysis to you.\n\nThat’s right -\n\nIt Is Still Just a Divergence\n\nOBV divergence is still a divergence. Divergences are good for a quick glance to see where the market is at. They are not precise enough to give you information like “buy now”.\n\nTo get that level of precision, you will need to either use additional different indicators or you can “scale in”/”scale out” of your position.\n\nScaling in or out is basically DCA of speculative trading.\n\nSummary\n\nThe OBV oscillator script on TradingView makes OBV-price divergence more prominent on shorter timeframes. If used well, it will give you the chance to get better entry or exit price.\n\nOBV as well as OBV divergences can be traded on at cryptocurrency markets, stock markets and in general anywhere as long as the volume data is public.\n",

      title: "How to buy a fraction on bitcoin: Where can you do a pocket money DCA?",
      content: "Bitcoin is over ten years old now, but there are still plenty new people buying their first ever crypto.\n\nInevitably, the first question of a newbie crypto investor will be: Can you buy a small fraction of bitcoin? Or a fraction of Ethereum?\n\n\n  The answer is yes, you can absolutely buy a tiny fraction of a cryptocoin.\n\n\nOnce you get into the practicalities of doing that, another question will come up:\n\nCan you buy a fractions of bitcoin without getting ripped off on fees?\n\n\n  The answer is again - yes. But you will need to do some due diligence.\n\n\nThis article is here to help you with that.\n\nHow to buy a tiny fraction of bitcoin or altcoin (less than 10 USD)\n\nBack in the day, you would use a bitcoin ATM to buy small fractions of Bitcoin. And that’s a fair choice if you want to buy just once. If you want to make that purchase a regular affair though, your bitcoin ATM fees will soon add up.\n\nThis is a list of crypto platforms on which you can buy small fractions of cryptocurrency with fairer fees that crypto ATMs.\n\n\n  Platforms are rated based on how friendly they are towards small crypto purchases.\n  Other than the minimum fraction limit, we also rate their fees and whether you can withdraw the crypto you bought.\n  We ordered the onramp platforms from the best to the worst.\n\n\n1. Buy a fraction of BTC at Large Regulated Custodial Crypto Exchanges [THE BEST]\n\n\n  Minimum traded size ~ 1 USD on some exchanges, on some markets\n  Trading fees 0.1-0.5% (negligible for small traders)\n\n\nRegulated crypto exchanges are the most cost-effective way to buy small fractions of cryptocurrency.\n\nThe transaction fees are low, the price of the coin is its true market price and you can deposit or withdraw crypto whenever you want.\n\nMinimum order size is most typically 10 USD/AUD/EUR/GBP for BTC markets.\n\n\n  On smaller altcoin markets the minimum order size may be higher than 10 USD.\n  At the Australian Independent Reserve, minimum order size is 1 AUD/NZD/USD/SGD. Fees are high but for tiny orders they won’t add up - and at least you can actually buy.\n\n\nOther trusted Crypto exchanges are Kraken, Gemini and Binance.\n\nCons of buying at a large regulated exchange\n\n\n  You will need a bank account. Choose an exchange as local to your banking network as possible, else you’ll get extra fees.\n    \n      US: Kraken, Gemini\n      EU: Kraken\n      AU/NZ: Independent Reserve\n      Singapore: Independent Reserve\n      East Asia: Binance\n    \n  \n  Withdrawals from the exchange into your wallet can be expensive. The withdrawal fee will rarely be below 10 USD for BTC or ETH right now.\n    \n      If you want to avoid losing that much money, leave the money at the exchange.\n      Independent Reserve and other regulated exchanges offer cryptoasset insurance for a small yearly fee.\n      Binance, Bitfinex and other exchange offer on-platform staking where your cryptocurrency wallet earns interest simply for leaving it on the exchange\n    \n  \n\n\n2. Buy a fraction of BTC at P2P Marketplaces\n\n\n  Minimum traded size ~ 5 USD\n  Low fees, but price above the market (you will pay extra ~2% in total)\n  No need to withdraw, if your P2P app gives you the private key to your account (you save withdrawal fee and money spent on Ledger wallet)\n\n\nThe current top p2p marketplace is called LocalCryptos.\n\nThe pros of buying a fraction of crypto on LocalCryptos should be pretty clear:\n\n\n  LocalCryptos is a zero-knowledge decentralized app. The owners of the marketplace have zero information about its traders and zero access to the user wallets.\n  The marketplace runs on smart contracts, again without any access of owners or admins (BTC and LTC blockchains do support a much simplified version of “smart contracts”.)\n  No KYC is required, no bank account is required. You can buy for cash by meeting someone in person.\n  LocalCryptos already is a wallet. Your account comes with private keys that only you know. You don’t need to withdraw crypto from there, but you can do so if you want to.\n\n\nGo to LocalCryptos\n\nCons of buying from a P2P marketplace\n\nUsing a marketplace like LocalCryptos still requires at least basic understanding of blockchains and the related technology.\n\n\n\n3. Buy a fraction of BTC at a Bitcoin ATM\n\n\n  Minimum traded size ~ 10 USD\n  Crazy high fees (5-10%)\n\n\nAsking around on social media, you will find that surprisingly many people still use Bitcoin ATMs to purchase fractions of bitcoins.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with that, except the outrageous fees. Bitcoin ATMs charge anything between 5-10% transaction fee.\n\n\n  If you just want to make a small one off purchase with some cash, don’t sweat it and use the ATM. Here’s our guide on how to use a BTC ATM\n  If you buy regularly, do that on a crypto exchange or a p2p marketplace.\n\n\nCons of buying from a crypto ATM\n\nEven if you only literally have pocket money to spend on crypto, over time the fees will add up.\n\n4. Buy a fraction of BTC via Revolut app [THE WORST]\n\n\n  Minimum buy is super low\n  Fees are super high\n  You cannot withdraw your crypto\n\n\nAmong beginners, Revolut is a popular way to buy crypto. Sadly, except convenience, it has the worst of everything.\n\nOnce you get a Revolut account and get verified, buying crypto is basically 2 clicks away.\n\nThe fees are high though, and you will never be able to withdraw your crypto. Nor you own any private keys, if there are any private keys at all…\n\nRevolut’s version of crypto works mostly as a contract for difference: You can buy and sell to generate profit in fiat currency, but you cannot buy crypto to use it as money.\n\nMore about buying crypto on Revolut\n\nSummary\n\n\n  Buying small amount of crypto on a non-custodial marketplace is easy enough and still cheap.\n  Minimum purchase amount on custodial exchanges can be as low as 1 USD, but you might get hammered on transaction fees.\n\n",

      title: "Red Flags of a Trading Platform in Trouble",
      content: "This is a PSA on how to tell your crypto exchange is in trouble.\n\nThe exchange used here as the poster child will be Bittrex, but I dare say some of the issues listed here might be very familiar to 2020 crypto traders as well.\n\n\n  Bittrex requires KYC/AML since 2019. Having been operational since 2014, it was a long journey to compliance though.\n\n\nWithdrawal Limits, Changes in TOS\n\nBittrex started off by letting users trade crypto unverified back in the wild days of 2014.\n\nThe first limitation implemented was a withdrawal limit on non-KYC traders. When a non-KYC exchange actively tries to block money of their users to keep much of it in the exchange wallets, it’s always a sign of something going wrong.\n\nIt could be preparation for exit scam, it could be collecting money to pay off legal fees (not much difference there).\n\nThe best user policy to that date was to not depositing money above current verification level, which failed everyone in 2017. The allowed levels were set in USD, but the valuation of crypto shot up like crazy that year.\n\nLocking up customer funds\n\nAs soon as Bittrex started playing with their account limitation settings, masses of people started turning to customer support - and never got any answer.\n\nThere were problems with money locked up, accounts disabled for no reason and of course the classic no response from customer service for months at a time.\n\nRedditors reported many cases of what some call “the kyc scam”:\n\n\n  Traders are allowed to sign up and start trading with no KYC/AML.\n  At some point the terms of use on the exchange change.\n  Once the trader collects profits and requests withdrawal, their account is blocked and strict KYC required.\n\n\nPrioritising Brand Damage Control\n\nOn Friday Dec 1 2017, Bittrex representative u/jyap reached out to the admins of the r/bittrex subreddit and demanded it to be closed down or set to private.\n\nThe r/bittrex admin u/keroncyst refused to hand over the subreddit.\n\nBittrex threatened to sue.\n\n\n  Screenshot of the private conversation\n  Discussion on Reddit\n\n\nThe subreddit was an unofficial one, set up by concerned Bittrex users who could not get hold of a customer support representative. And there were many…\n\nBittrex did not issue any comments on the situation, nobody addressed the issue. People who complied with KYC requests did not get any response from staff for months.\n\nTraders were understandably fearing exit scam or bankruptcy – as always, when the platform doesn’t provide public statements, people expect the worst.\n\nThe Bittrex subreddit was eventually handed over to official exchange representatives.\n\nBut even under the unofficial moderation it was not a scary place full of desperate bullying though. Nobody even offered bribes to customer support representatives, folklore known from other exchange subreddits. People were actually very well behaved, collecting information on how to get their KYC tickets solved.\n\nBittrex still prioritised brand damage control to solving customer tickets though.\n\nThe issue with that was pretty clear, especially in 2017: With crypto in a locked exchange account, the trader loses out on potential profits. Because nobody can trade those founds. Except of course the exchange, purely hypothetically.\n\nBe mindful of risks\n\nSince BitMEX started requiring KYC in mid 2020, crypto traders have been on a hunt for the next non-KYC place with perps and defi shitcoins.\n\nThere is a new crop of shady places like ByBit (who btw don’t pay their affiliates in case that’s your jam), WhiteBit, Latoken and others. Hell, even Bitfinex could get in trouble.\n\nConsider how and why red flags exist and when is the time run.\n",

      title: "PSA - Don't send ETH or ERC20 tokens between exchanges",
      content: "Ever since ETH trading launched on mainstream custodial exchanges, traders have been having this problem.\n\nWith Bitcoin, you could get away with sending BTC directly between exchanges - although technically you are not allowed to do that for legal reasons.\n\nEither way, most people assumed the same would go through with ETH.\n\nSending coins between exchanges does not work with ETH\n\nIt does not. Exchanges process ETH withdrawals via a smart contract, and deposits via different smart contract. It is a script, not a simple wallet to wallet transaction.\n\nAnd for the security of the funds, the deposit smart contract will reject any funds that come from a smart contract, not from a plain wallet.\n\nIf you send ETH directly from another exchange, it will be coming from a contract and it will not be credited on the receiving side.\n\nSending USDt between exchanges\n\nThe same rule as for ETH extends for any token that lives on the ETH blockchain. With any ERC20 token, transactions to and from exchanges get processed via smart contracts and funds incoming from a contract rather than from a wallet are typically rejected.\n\nThat means that you need to be careful even with stablecoins like Tether. USDt was originally built on the Omni layer to extend bitcoin, but currently uses several different blockchains for transport.\n\nUSDt currently supports the following transport protocols: Bitcoin (Omni and Liquid Protocol), Ethereum, EOS, Tron, Algorand, BCH and OMG.\n\nSince Tether tokens are available via several protocols, to send USDt tokens you need to carefully check the destination address to confirm you are selecting the correct transport protocol.\n\nTransporting USDt in its ERC20 form is not possible directly between exchanges.\n\nThe legal issues with sending cryptos between exchanges: Do not test them on this in 2021\n\nThe legal part of this PSA, if you are interested.\n\nIn 2020 the authorities started cracking down hard on non-KYC exchanges.\n\nSending money directly between two crypto trading platforms is problematic in this regard. If you think about what it actually does, you will find it could be interpreted as sending money between two banks.\n\nThe only exchange that has a banking license is Kraken.\n\nYou can safely assume that the most popular exchanges like Bitfinex will not get anything close to a banking license anytime soon.\n\nAct accordingly.\n\n\n  More about Bitfinex and Deversifi\n\n\nWhat if you already did it?\n\nThe receiving exchange still has the money. It is not completely lost.\n\nWhat you need is to contact the customer service and get them to manually credit it.\n\nThis can lead to varying amounts of trouble, depending how overloaded the support system currently is.\n\nIn periods of heavy market action, the support will be overloaded and you will probably need to harass them on social media for attention. They might also charge you for solving deposit issues.\n\nAlso, due to the legal issues above, it is possible they will refuse to help you.\n\nAnyway, it is better to try.\n\n\n  Bitfinex maintains the r/bitfinex\n  Kraken reps will get back to you on mentioning “kraken exchange” or “kraken futures” in r/bitcoinmarkets dailies\n\n",

      title: "Real PoW Crypto Fundamentals: Crypto Mining and Network Activity",
      content: "Proof-of-Work cryptocurrencies operate in a drastically different way than fiat money.\n\nDeFi and collateralised stablecoins like Dai are much closer to a money operated by central bank.\n\nThis post is not about DeFi or stablecoins. It’s about the fundamentals of mined, proof-of-work cryptos based on blockchain that gets generated in a given sequence that cannot be changed to create monetary policies.\n\nImmutability as a fundamental\n\nAny changes brought to a public blockchain are publicly recorded and these records cannot be tampered with.\n\nThat provides it with a digital, but nonetheless real fundamental - it is impossible to generate money out of thin air based on an order by an authority.\n\nWhere this doesn’t hold true are IOU coins - stablecoins. Stablecoins pegged to a target use the exact same monetary policies as central banks. They manipulate supply, change interest rate and some do open market interventions as well.\n\nProof Of Work: Mining as a fundamental\n\nInformation is distributed through blockchain in nodes called blocks. To add new information to the blocks, a member of the network has to provide the famous proof of work, or PoW, by solving a sort of mathematical calculation.\n\nOne type of such “new information” added to the blockchain are transactions.\n\nPoW mining devices are set up to look for a solution of a mathematical problem. When a solution is found, a new block in the ledger is “mined”. The new block is broadcast and with it all the information submitted to add to the blockchain.\n\nThe miner collects a payout in the blockchain’s currency as a reward for providing the proof of work. This is how the supply of the cryptocurrency is provided.\n\nHashrate vs price\n\nAn important fundamental metric here is hashrate.\n\nHashrate is the speed at which mining devices are completing the proof-of-work operation.\n\nThe higher the hashrate, the better the opportunity of finding the next block and receiving the mining reward.\n\nThere is a hashrate vs price dynamic in Bitcoin or other PoW cryptos. It is not a quick one to react on changes in the market, though.\n\nThere are traders who claim that “Bitcoin is structured so that hashrate follows price”. The reason is meant to be the same one as the one that contributes to the jumpy character and overreactions we keep seeing in crypto: Delayed decisions.\n\nIn a bear market, some miners choose to keep mining at a loss. By doing that they speculate that they will survive long enough to eventually realize a profit. That is not completely irrational.\n\nSome miners will drop out, which will make it easier to mine because there is now less competition. This is a hashrate increase. The increased profitability of mining will lure miners back in. But just as with traders waiting for a reversal, very few are eager to take a risk without confirmation. In the case of mining profitability, miners are waiting for a bull run to start. Once this confirmation comes, miners and traders alike will FOMO back into the market.\n\nHashprice\n\nFor fundamental analysis of big cryptos like Bitcoin, also consider “hashprice” instead of “hashrate”.\n\nHash Price measures the daily mining profits, it is the ratio of daily mining revenue and the hashes generated per day.\n\nHashrate fluctuates a lot, hashprice gives a much clearer picture.\n\n\n\nOn the chart from here you can see that both hashrate and hashprice of BTC started reversing upwards when the market overreacted with the drop to 3K USD.\n\nNetwork Activity\n\nNetwork activity is a much less technical fundamental market metric.\n\nThe basic idea is to judge the health of a blockchain network by how much it gets used.\n\n\n  In the case of cryptocurrencies meant as money, such as BTC, the most important market metrics are transaction counts, ATM counts worldwide, P2P trade stats.\n  In the case of blockchain platforms, the dApp development on them is key.\n\n\nSome form of network activity is relevant market metric in any type of cryptocurrency: DeFi uses similar metrics to asses the health of its markets.\n\nCrypto Mining Infographic\n\n\n",

      title: "3 Most Dangerous Cryptocurrency Beginner Mistake in 2020",
      content: "The year 2022 is the time when once again, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple and even the smaller altcoins are going through a new surge in both price and common interest.\n\nThe last time the crypto markets had a record transaction traffic as well as steep rise in valuation was in 2017-2018. That was the height of the so called market bull run.\n\nThe Crypto Bull Run Attracted Newbies For A Reason\n\nEven the most mature and conservative crypto-asset Bitcoin gained crazy percentages in dollar value and soared just past the $20k mark in January 2018.\n\nThis was an incredible rise since just a year before that in January 2017, one BTC was worth about $700. That’s 28 times your investment in just one year.\n\nThis kind of year-on-year gain makes it is easy to understand why the cryptocurrency market is now attracting people from all over the world. All are hoping for their chance to win big when investing in Bitcoin, or in an altcoin.\n\nThe rush and greed that goes through the mind of any investor is completely understandable. Many hope that a small $100 investment could be worth $2800 just one year later once again.\n\nWill the history repeat itself? I don’t know. I feel positive for Bitcoin and some other cryptocurrencies, but that’s as much as I can say.\n\nWhat I do know is that with every new investor that enters the market as a complete beginner, we keep seeing the same elementary mistakes. The news keep being reported about people losing money through their mistakes, there are Reddit and Facebook posts made by those users all the time as well.\n\nBefore the next bull run happens and with it the new surge in noob users, let us take a look at the 3 worst crypto beginner mistakes that you should avoid no matter what.\n\nThe 3 Riskiest Mistakes That You Should Know Before Investing In Crypto\n\n1 - Thinking that a low dollar value means it’s cheap\n\nA lot of beginners are looking to find the next BTC and the next ETH. That is the reason why many newbies invested in LTC instead of BTC as soon as Bitcoin started getting set in four-digit dollar values.\n\nPeople look at prices as a way to evaluate the amount of growth the crypto-asset’s price will get.\n\nIt doesn’t work like that.\n\nJust because this tokens is valued at $0.04 cent per token doesn’t mean it’s cheap. If nothing else, the price will be based on the total available supply. There might be hundred billions of tokens available, or even an uncapped amount of tokens to be generated.\n\nA low USD price doesn’t mean the cryptocurrency must be undervalued. Use the market capitalisation instead to compare value between different cryptocurrencies.\n\n\n  TIP: We have a full Trading Strategy writeup on investing in crypto for the long haul.\n\n\n2 - Keeping your cryptocurrencies on an exchange\n\nI know it’s easy to buy a cryptocurrency on an exchange like Coinbase or Binance and then just leave it there. It works at that moment, you can tell yourself that most likely nothing will happen, or that your exchange is trustworthy, and so on.\n\nBut there are considerable risks to leaving your cryptocurrencies on any exchange.\n\nYou are basically leaving your cryptocurrencies in the hands of Coinbase or Binance and hoping that they won’t get hacked and won’t shut down.\n\nAnd not it’s not the same thing as leaving your funds in a bank account.\n\nBank funds are normally insured up to a certain amount, and then there are processes in place to refund any stolen funds. It doesn’t work the same with cryptocurrencies. Crypto-assets are still seen as high risk, crypto exchanges are often dubious offshore setups and regulations on the market are inconsistent at best, which is why business credit corporations are not exactly queuing up to insure crypto trading platforms or wallets.\n\nSome exchanges are better than others. There can be reimbursement funds or partial insurance for fully verified customers from certain domiciles. But it’s not foolproof.\n\nIt is much better to get yourself a wallet that you fully own, and learn how cryptocurrency wallets work. Make a safe backup of your private keys and do your part to secure your crypto.\n\n\n  TIP: Your wallet should live on a device that is not used for your daily activities. Use either a hardware wallet or make sure your wallet lives on a device you don’t use for anything else, such an old phone.\n\n\n3 - Falling for a silly scams\n\nUnfortunately the crypto markets space is full of scams. Have you heard about OneCoin or Bitconnect?\n\nTypical scam or a ponzi scheme promises great returns. That is exactly what most new crypto investors are coming for, and so some crypto scams can be really successful. Usually you will have to start contributing to a pyramid scheme, or pay membership fees. This money is then used to finance some of the returns before the scheme collapses. You only make some money bac if you get in very early while it is still cheap.\n\nSo if you come by an offer that sounds too good to be true, then 99/100 times it will in fact be too good be true and probably some kind of trick. A trick where you would need to deposit money to earn money in the future.\n\nMaybe it will even work for a while to entice you to invest more. But eventually the scheme will fail.\n\nJust be aware that due to the lack of regulations, investment scams are still happening more often in the cryptocurrency space.\n\nConclusion\n\nThere are many positive things happening in the blockchain and cryptocurrency industries. And there is again new wide-spread interest building up around Bitcoin as well as other cryptocurrencies.\n\nAnd that’s great to see.\n\nBut what’s less positive are these mistakes, scams and crypto hacks happening.\n",

      title: "In 2020, Women Are Finally Breaking Into the Bitcoin Industry",
      content: "Are there many women on the bitcoin markets?\n\nDue to the pseudonymity of Bitcoin, the total counts of Bitcoin wallets held by women is forever speculative. The cryptocurrency was designed in such a way that the owner of it would not need to provide self-identifying material in order to interact with the digital currency.\n\nStill, as adoption rates have soared, analytics and oversight have started peeling back the veil.\n\nThis is because governmental legislation in some countries begins to tighten its grip on digital currencies and reporting the world over as adoption continues to rise.\n\nWhat was once built to be a fully decentralized arena, the “Wild West” of currency exchange, is now subject to KYC practices and tax liability.\n\nExchanges report increase in user numbers\n\nWhich might not be a bad thing. At the very least, it gives us more information about who is actually on the market.\n\nAs more new users introduce themselves into the cryptocurrency market, using online exchange platforms like Bitvavo, bitcoin markets have seen a surge in women users.\n\nThis may suggest the cryptocurrency markets are stabilizing. Perhaps Bitcoin is indeed becoming the safe-haven asset it has long been touted to be.\n\nWomen in Tech\n\nHistorically speaking, women rarely showed up to the bargaining tables and boardrooms of tech companies and financial industries.\n\nWhile numbers are slowly starting to find an equilibrium these days, women still only make up anywhere from 10 to 30 percent of this workforce.\n\nPrior to 2018, these numbers were reflected even more poorly in the Bitcoin arena. At least according to the estimates, women were making up less than 7% of cryptocurrency users in 2017. The market created approximately $85 billion of wealth creation that year, but apparently women were not around for that.\n\nSo why the change in 2020?\n\nBitcoin was historically touted as a “boys club” straight from its humble beginnings. While no one knew exactly who started the digital currency, as its founder Satoshi Nakamoto is a pseudonym, one that has never been attributed to any one person or group of people.\n\nBut, the currency got its start in the ultra-male focused field of technology sciences, going even deeper than standard IT circles - into the mega geek recesses of PC gamers and cyberpunk communities.\n\nThe original forums and social apps that promoted bitcoin, like Reddit and 4chan, are still to this day marketed to and largely populated by males. To the point that bitcoin and blockchain industries pre-late 2018 were having meetings in strip clubs and the virtual backrooms of these male-centric digital social clubs.\n\nWhether this was an active effort to shut out female participation, or just a natural expression of a historically male-dominated field is up for debate.\n\nWhy Women Choose Bitcoin\n\nIt was thought that this disparity exists largely because of the underground origins of the coin. Bitcoin was first made famous for bent-truth applications like purchasing illegal pornography, drugs, and even weapons or hitmen on the dark web.\n\nHowever, following the FBI raid and shut down of the “Silk Road” the famous underground den of iniquity where such purchases could be made, Bitcoin adoption didn’t falter.\n\nThat left many to wonder just how true those original claims were.\n\nEither way, women have been slow to adopt digital currencies and blockchain technology.\n\nSome of the modern spins on evolutionary theory proclaim that this is because of the difference in the social values of many women, where concerns lie heavily with supporting families.\n\nWomen are found to be far more risk-averse than men, suggesting that choosing to delve into budding tech businesses and highly volatile market speculation is less likely to appeal to women on a psychological level.\n\nWhich may explain why the crypto industry is only really starting to capture the female interest and adoption in 2020. The industry is somewhat more established. The dollar valuation of Bitcoin is somewhat stable, at least compared to the past.\n\nMore women are starting to show up as investors, traders, analysts, journalists, developers, and startup leaders. Massive crypto companies like Binance and Bancor lend credence to this theory, as near 50% of their employees are female.\n\nMore ICOs and blockchain startups are being spearheaded by women in 2020. Tezos, arguably one of the most exciting ICOs since Ethereum is co-founded by a woman. Blockchain divisions of IBM and JPMorgan Chase are headed by women.\n\nIn the past two years, women in blockchain-related industries have increased from 8% to 12%, with no signs of stopping. Women like Elizabeth Stark, founder of bitcoins’ Lightning Network protocol, are paving the way for lower tiers of women-focused involvement.\n\nChanging Times\n\nThe increasing interest from women may make sense, especially when weighed against the historic participation of women in business fields.\n\nGenerally speaking, the integration of digital currencies became commonplace throughout many sectors of everyday life. Even if those are not necessarily cryptocurrencies, it is now less outlandish to imagine investing into a cryptocurrency even for someone who is fairly conservative.\n\nAlso, a whole another point of view comes up in the light of the current economic recession or even the previous government failures in some countries, where Bitcoin already offers a more stable choice of income for anyone who works remotely.\n",

You want to submit your order and have it filled with not much issues.\n\nAs a rule, you get better liquidity on custodial exchanges (you need to send coins to an exchange wallet to trade).\n\nIt is true that the tide is starting to turn slightly in favor of noncustodial trading (you can trade directly from your own wallet). Still, if you are just starting out, custodial exchanges will be easier for you to trade on and so that’s what we are sticking with here.\n\nAnother sweeping statement: Asian crypto exchanges are great for liquid markets. They are always busy enough due to the higher popularity of speculation and also, quite honestly, due to the fake volume generating bots.\n\nHowever, many trading platforms in Asia notoriously don’t do small altcoins much. Listing fees on the most liquid places like OKex or Binance are too high for small projects.\n\nYou might be more lucky on places like YoBit.\n\n\n\nRecommended No-KYC Crypto Trading Exchanges\n\n\n  (Custodial) Bitfinex: spot, margin, lending, futures, airdrops\n  (Custodial) WhiteBit: futures, airdrops has limits\n  (Non-Custodial) LocalCryptos: onramp\n  (Non-Custodial) Uniswap: spot\n  (Non-Custodial) LeverJ: futures\n\n\nWhy the “has limits” callout? These exchanges have withdrawal limits. That increases the risks associated with trading there. More in this blog.\n\nMost liquid centralized (custodial) altcoin trading platforms:\n\n\n  OKEx: Smaller selection of alts but easy access to derivatives.\n  Bitfinex: Unique selection of alts and now also derivatives (no minimum deposit anymore).

Does not welcome US traders.\n  Yobit: Busy and very liquid den of wild speculation, big and small alts.\n\n\nIMPORTANT! BitMEX platform is no longer recommended since mid-2020.\n\n  \n    For futures trading, use Bitfinex (no KYC, 6% fee discount)\n  \n  \n    For perps and crypto options, use Deribit (easy KYC, 10% fee discount)\n  \n\n\nAvoid these trading platforms - Poloniex, HitBTC and new unknown exchanges that will not have enough liquidity.\n\n\n  Stability\n\n\nThe platform’s technical stability is super important for active trading.\n\nAny trading platform will need to have downtime for maintenance, but it should be scheduled and announced beforehand. Other than that the platform availability should be as high as possible.\n\nMost of all, a crypto exchange should not crash under heavy traffic - ever. Altoin markets are prone to FOMO, everyone knows that, it is not like the exchange management could get surprised by that. Plus, trading platforms earn crazy money on fees, they can afford server maintenance just fine.\n\nMost stable crypto trading platform:\n\n\n  Binance - occasional downtime communicated via Twitter\n  OKEx - hardly any downtime\n  Bitfinex - generally stable, downtime communicated via status page\n\n\nLeast stable crypto trading platform:\n\n\n  BitMEX - servers unreachable very often, not recommended\n\n\nIMPORTANT!

For altcoin speculation you don’t need USD or other fiat markets at all. The ratios in which alts are traded is often BTC or ETH.

      title: "Will Your Bitcoin Investment Suffer from Coronavirus?",
      content: "The global financial markets crash with every natural or man-made disaster. This has been going on for time immemorial, the governments and policy makers still have not found a way around it.\n\nSome say it’s just the problem of fiat currencies, that they are not resilient enough. Fiat is easily impacted by disasters, wars, trade wars, hostilities, nature’s fury or anything that stirs the waters. These failures of governments, central banks and finance industry is felt most on the poorest classes of society.\n\nIn this article, we will look at why the coronavirus pandemic may propel the authorities to look at Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as a viable and resilient model.\n\nSocial classes most impacted by the Coronavirus crisis\n\nMiddle class and lower middle classes invest in low-risk schemes with the hope of creating a financial safety net. Yet, every time the market goes for a tumble billions of dollars of their hard-earned investments turn to dust.\n\nThe world has gone through many such disasters and typically, people who are in a position to take these decisions, do not fare for the masses.\n\nThe need of the hour is to give traditional financial systems a serious rethink. Why is it not possible to lessen the effects of disasters from our financial systems? This will help billions of people all over the world protect themselves, not die from hunger and continue living in a much better way.\n\nCan Bitcoin emerge as a Relatively Stable Financial Asset in 2020?\n\nBitcoin was founded as a response to the financial crisis of 2007 and 2008.\n\nIts mythical Founder, Satoshi Nakamoto stated in the Bitcoin Whitepaper that the cryptocurrency is free from external influences. This means that factors like recession, inflation and natural emergencies do not have an effect on the valuation.\n\nThe aim of Bitcoin as a cryptocurrency is to establish one single digital currency that holds the same value in every part of the world. This frees up currency manipulations, speculations and other negative implications that authorities have on fiat currencies.\n\nMany people have the opinion that because any real assets do not back Bitcoin, it does not hold any value. A dollar or a pound boasts of a certain value, because the government says so.\n\nBitcoin is “Too volatile to be money”\n\nWhen Bitcoin first emerged, the price of ‘One Bitcoin’ was a few dollars. In late 2017, the price of that same Bitcoin had skyrocketed to over $20000 USD! As you read this article, Bitcoin is trading at $7000 USD.\n\nThis has been the evergreen argument against Bitcoin’s use as money: It makes paying for services difficult if your means of payment is volatile.\n\nSome financial experts and investors predict that the volatility associated with Bitcoins is gone.\n\nThere are still real effects in play that might influence the short-term prices of cryptocurrencies in unforeseen ways. One of them is the oil market crash in April 2020, which apparently influences crypto as the oil companies used their oil to generate electricity and mine Bitcoin:\n\n\n\nThen there is also the bigger picture, though.\n\nEven before the Coronavirus crisis, it was expected that in 2020 Bitcoin would surge in value and appreciate. It was not only because of the Bitcoin halving in May 2020. It was also known that some nations were taking a serious look at Bitcoins. India was among them. China too has advocated a positive response to cryptocurrencies.\n\nLikewise, even before Coronavirus crisis there were several grassroots protest movements against how the lower end of working class is treated in Europe, and for democracy in Asia. The Yellow Vest movement paralyzed France even before Covid-19 and caused serious economic damage on its own.\n\nThe changes cannot be ignored\n\nEven if that might have been the intention, apparently since 2019 it is no longer possible to treat the general population like a disposable clog in the global debt economy. The world economy will want to protect itself from shocks that cause it to come crashing down.\n\nThis is why private investors and asset managers are asking their clients to invest in Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies.\nThey are looking for an alternative and a way to move forward. The liquidity and funding they provide at least for now also enables individuals to take part in cryptocurrency trading.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt is high time that policy makers and authorities try to change the rules of global finance. If this is not done, every emergency will cause billions of people to suffer. The world is slowly moving towards cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin’s presence and rise in valuation over the last decade is a testament to that fact.\n",

      title: "Script Spotlight: Bollinger Band Width",
      content: "In this Script Spotlight we are looking at scripts of Bollinger Band Width that are available from Tradingview public library. If you don’t have a TradingView account yet, make a free one here.\n\nBollinger Band Width\n\nBollinger band width indicator (or “bandwidth”) belongs to the more straightforward derivations of the famous Bollinger bands.\n\nThe gist of the Bollinger bandwidth script is essentially plotting the information about how far apart are the Standard Deviation lines of Bollinger bands, that is, the outer bands.\n\n\n\nBollinger bands is a technical analysis indicator providing information about volatility that, thanks to the indicator, is displayed in such a way that it can show more clearly in which direction is the market likely to move in the nearest future:\n\n\n  The middle band is a moving average, typically the SMA, therefore the current mean or “average” price.\n  The outer bands are standard deviations of that mean, measuring how far the current action has the price spike out away from its mean.\n  Capital markets work in cycles, a directional movement (a bull run or a bear descent) always starts after at least a short relatively stable period - that is, period of lower volatility. And the other way around - if the price is running in a trend but the bandwidth is hitting its max, some topping out or re-accumulation range could soon follow.\n\n\nThere are two interesting versions of Bollinger band width on Tradingview:\n\n\n  Simple Bollinger Bandwidth with high/low reference that just plots the width as a line and lets you compare different time periods.\n  The IO_BBWidth script that uses weighted moving average and will color the background of your line chart when the market starts trending, so that you cannot tell yourself whatever fits your bias.\n\n\nLet’s take a look at the IO-BB-Width.\n\nFull script code\n\nDoes it work?\n\nWhen you first load the script into a BTCUSD chart, with the default settings you will find that it shows the market always trending. The reason is, the default setting is meant for ultra short timeframes.\n\nYou will need to backtest the coloring threshold on the timeframe of your choice, based on the near past.\n\nOnce you’ve done that though, it’s actually a pretty useful piece of info because it will show you when the current run starts running out of steam.\n\nWhile it is often just to take a breather (a short period of low volatility doesn’t always mean the run is over), if you’re trading with leverage or with timing limitation (such as with derivatives), you will definitely find this information useful and not enter any new positions until the situation starts clearing up.\n\nHere is the indicator with 21 day WAP, stdev3 and a threshold of 500 on BTCUSD 4H:\n\n\n\nYou can see it is not super precise; it’s not the kind of information you should use to trigger your getting into a position - it’s far more valuable to consult it if you are considering getting out.\n\nOn a 5M chart for BTCUSD you can use the same information in a different way - here with the threshold of 150 you can see it will highlight just the time periods that happened to be most volatile. On super short timeframes you are of course not looking for a sustainable trend, but if you’re a scalper, this information is pretty good for you.\n\n\n\nAs with longer timeframes though - you will need to backtest it.\n\nSummary\n\nBollinger bandwidth indicator in its basic form provides no new information, you can get all this just from looking at the bands.\n\nIt is just a more convenient way to display it, because with bbands you are adding a lot of new lines over your price action and it can get a little crowded there.\n\nHaving the bandwidth in a separate box under the price chart also lets you plot in additional things or set up squeeze alerts, which can come handy if you are scalping.\n",

      title: "Stats of 2019: What did crypto traders most spend on?",
      content: "\n  Products of 2019\n\n\n2019: Preferred Crypto Trading Platforms\n\nThe biggest change from the 2018 meta post is probably the cool-off of BitMEX affiliate earnings.\n\nThis comes quite as a surprise: The overall volume traded on BitMEX pretty much follows the price of Bitcoin.\n\nThere were no crazy bubbles in either 2018 or 2019, but BitMEX did make a decent volume in the summer of 2019. Could it be that gamblers with 300 USD worth of LTH stash perhaps got convinced they are only winning at life if they capitalize on every 5% uptick of the BTCUSD market?\n\nEither way - the readers of this blog did not fancy BitMEX as much in 2019 as they did in 2018.\n\n\n  More about BitMEX + referral code for 10% fee discount\n\n\n\n\nhttps://coinpaprika.com/exchanges/bitmex/\n\nAs for crypto trading in general, that didn’t go anywhere though.\n\nThere was a new wave of influx to Bitfinex once again. It is incredible considering their notorious banking issues, but the commission patterns suggest that people do DCA through there.\n\nAdditionally, since the new affiliate platform on Bitfinex pays you out in the currency spent by the referred user, let me tell you that the activity has been predominantly fiat getting spent and shitcoins getting flipped. There has been next to no selling of top-tier cryptocurrencies from the readers of this blog.\n\n\n  More about Bitfinex: the people, the apps and the 6% fee discount referral code here … or use our super customized shill link bit.ly/catch-me-if-ya-can\n\n\n2019 New crypto trading apps\n\nNear the end of the year there have been several new products added and while it will be for the next year to see how they do, there has been some interest into the 3commas DCA bot.\n\n2019 Preferred Crypto Wallets and Asset Management\n\nIt is no surprise that one of the biggest product hits of the year 2019 was Ledger Nano X.\n\nA new product which was on top of the natural tech hype offered in bulk packs on discount.\n\n\n  Get Ledger Nano X without any discount because ur rich\n\n\nFrom competing products, Keepkey is pretty much forgotten and Trezor still has some user base. Nevertheless Ledger is still by far the winner here.\n\nHardware seed-phrase storage Billfodl (and Cryptosteel for the EU analog) have been linked from here only for a small part of the year but appear to pass for vanity products rather than something to rely on.\n\n2019 Preferred Crypto Technical Analysis Tools\n\nBy far the biggest hit among ATNET readers during all of 2019 were the subscription plans to the charting platform TradingView!\n\nThis is something that crypto traders have been signing up for a lot through the whole year.\n\nAll in all, the shift from entertainment and high-leverage trading to analysis comes off as a big change in comparison with the past.\n\nOne of the reasons of last year’s uptick could be that TradingView started accepting subscription payments in crypto early in 2019.\n\nWhile for the majority of shoppers in general implementing payments in crypto is in fact an unnecessary gimmick, for us who buy, sell and move cryptocurrencies on the daily it does make things easier. - Certainly easier than trying to log into your Paypal account from a third world country.\n\nFrom the perspective of the crowd around this blog I think it is safe to say that TradingView PRO is the product of 2019.\n\nNeedless to say, the interest in the more advanced platform TensorCharts has been tiny compared to TradingView.\n\nThat may be sad for those who want to complain about the decline of our civilization, especially when it comes to intelligence, but then again this is what gives you the edge with products like TensorCharts.\n\nClearly, the edge is still there even though the product is a couple of years old already.\n\nLet’s see what 2020 brings!\n",

      content: "Malware and exploits are a real maturing industry, the times are long gone when you had to be a literal high-tech lowlife in order to hack someone.\n\nAs we reported back in 2018, you can get Malware-as-a-Service for measly 20 bucks if you’re ok to try your luck with something generic in hopes there is still some low-hanging fruit left.\n\nIt’s going to be more expensive than that if you’re targeting a particular segment of the internet, especially if your target is more technically skilled than an average 70-year-old, but then these targets usually earn more when the attack succeeds. In the end, the investment may pay off.\n\nThis scenario is probably what we have been seeing in 2019 in cryptospace: Cryptocurrency-related crime and targeting of crypto-traders grew especially in the second half of 2019.\n\nThat means it’s probably making good money.\n\nCrypto-targeted threats: What are the dangers in 2020?\n\nBecause individuals involved in crypto are high-value targets, the attackers started milking as much as they can out of every successful hack.\n\nIf you become a victim, your machine will most likely get exploited in multiple different ways.\n\n\n  Typically your device will be searched for competing malware or hidden mining software, which will be either wiped out or redirected to the latest attacker who gained access to your stuff.\n  You will be scanned for cryptocurrency wallet files - bitcoin wallets, altcoin wallets, multicoin wallets. Don’t think that using little known wallet will protect you.\n  Next your device will be searched for anything related to cryptocurrency exchanges and crypto trading platforms: Any stored access credentials, 2FA backup codes, keys.\n  You will possibly get a keylogger or similar to learn your access credentials to wallet software, exchanges and also to your email - a hacked mailbox is valuable. Even if it’s not possible to restore passwords through it, it can be at least used to send off spam campaigns from a “legitimate” email account.\n  Last but not least, if your infected phone or laptop is not a model from the year 1960, it will probably have some spare capacity for illicit Monero mining.\n\n\nCrypto malware in 2020: Distribution\n\nHow are you most likely to get exploited?\n\n\n  Clicking on an email or social media link you did not expect\n\n\nAn IRS or similar official-looking file in an e-mail attachment is an old classic, but remember it might be coming from the email of someone you know if they got exploited.\n\n\n\n\n  Fake “Action required”\n\n\nIt could be the web wallet from blockchain.com, other hosted wallets or even trading platform accounts. If your e-mail got exposed in relation to some leaked data, as it probably happened with most of you in the 2019 BitMEX mass email fuckup, sooner or later you will get phishing emails prompting you to reset passwords or similar.\n\nSome of these are very good - the email design will be the exact copy of what you’d get from the real site just like the imposter landing page you will end up at. Some attackers even create fake companies to buy SSL certificates for their imposter sites.\n\n\n  Infected trading software and trading apps\n\n\nThis is the most recent way of targeting crypto traders who use Mac, once the platform without viruses. (Yeah, those days are long gone too.)\n\nThe malware was hidden inside an innocent-sounding CrashReporter executable in a clone of a real Mac app for trading on multiple platforms from a single place, a popular feature that active traders and arbers always search for.\n\nFrom sentinelone.com –  A fake company website offering “Advanced trading functions for cryptocurrency traders that includes: technical and fundamental analysis, automated trading and many other innovative features” was used to lure victims to a Github repo containing malware hidden inside an otherwise functional application.\n\nYou see that the app was distributed via Github, not via some obscure website you never heard of.\n\nHow to protect your crypto\n\nYou might feel threatened about technically complex and expensive to pull off vulnerabilities in hardware wallets, yet meanwhile it’s getting dangerous out there.\n\nPotential dangers come from downloading any new crypto wallet, trading application or anything that could be of interest to crypto traders - including memes which can carry steganographic payload.\n\nIt is always safer to have a triered device system for crypto, including a burner device that you use as a dumpster for every activity that is potentially dangerous.\n",

      title: "Technical Analysis in Cryptocurrency Trading",
      content: "This post on cryptocurrency technical analysis specifics was originally published in 2016.\n\nBack then, it was a common debate in the TradingView chat whether technical analysis in crypto can actually work at all.\n\nDoes Technical Analysis Work in Crypto?\n\nIt was the time when the multi-year bull market in Bitcoin and most other cryptos was in its infancy, the markets were acting wild and every futures contract settlement day was filled with what Reddit dubbed the “Bart formation”: A steep rise in a single candle that doesn’t really catch on and is subsequently dumped in another single candle, or alternatively the opposite sequence known as the “inverse Bart”.\n\n\n\nThis used to be the daily bread of the BTCUSD market back in the day when it was a niche play, and it still can look this wild on small-cap altcoin markets.\n\nIn contrast to that, traders using some technical analysis tools and methods (along with healthy skepticism and well-trained judgement) have been more successful than not on the crypto markets.\n\nThe reason lies in the way technical analysis works in general.\n\nSo, how does technical analysis work at all?\n\nAlways loyal to my first trading principle:- Draw a lot of lines so it will look like you know what you are doing. pic.twitter.com/na9WaByn28&mdash; via Crypto Rand (@crypto_rand)\n\nThe problematic part lies in the way technical analysis works, not only in crypto but on any kind of market in general.\n\nTechnical trading in its core is about looking for chart patterns. Chart patterns are sequences of price action that are vaguely repetitive, which means that if you notice a pattern in the making, you have slightly better odds when speculating on what the price will do next.\n\nTechnical Trading as Relying on the Machine\n\nOne aspect of technical trading relies on what could be called the mechanical capabilities of the markets.\n\nIt is reasonable to assume some resistance to change in prices, when you are looking at the chart of something that is a currency or a company stock - really very much most often the value of any real thing will not change 100% overnight.\n\nThe technical analysis play for this principle can be translated into an indicator like bbands, which in very simple terms is a median price wrapped in its standard deviations. If the price action wanders out of the standard deviations boundary, it will most often be just about the time it starts wandering back inside - unless something nonstandard is happening. Looking at overbought and oversold areas at RSIs and similar oscillators is the same idea.\n\nTechnical Trading as Relying on History\n\nAnother aspect are historical levels that form support/resistance areas.\n\nThe idea behind this focus of technical analysis is not guessing that the price is likely to do the same thing at the price level that is being revisited, the roots of support and resistance are in the basic supply/demand logic.\n\nIf there is a price level that has been clearly perceived as “too expensive” since the history shows that used to be a lot of selling at one or more points in the past, then the demand will most likely weaken around that level again in the future, and that for so long until something outside of technical analysis changes.\n\nIn some cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin you could start talking about the halving here: If the supply of the asset decreases and at the same time the demand for it doesn’t decrease, at some point this will lead to rise in prices. On the charts, this will render as breaking up through a resistance zone.\n\nThe breaking up through resistance or breaking down through support can also be fully and completely a result of speculation, though. It is important to keep in mind that the price action on the charts is really just a result of the many forces acting on the market, not the gospel that defines the truth. Assets can be undervalued, assets can be overvalued.\n\nAnd then there’s the one last thing to this: Support and resistance is such a popular technical analysis principle that it already takes us to the last aspect:\n\n\n  TA is a protocol for traders to implicitly coordinate their activities, using price history as the communications medium. u/dasignint on Reddit\n\n\nTechnical Trading as Relying on… Technical Trading\n\nEspecially with the rare and joyful events, like when a market is making new highs and so there is no history to account for, it’s time to shine for tools like Fibonacci, known most often as “fibs”. Fibs use obscure formulas which probably border on abuse of mathematics to project price levels where the future reversals are likely to occur.\n\nHow is that useful?\n\nShort-term traders, and there are always many, like to flow with the market in both directions. This means that they do not want to risk missing a retracement, even if a short one.\n\nThis particular type of a trader would normally look at support and resistance levels to mark for themselves the price levels where the action is likely to reverse. When they do not have resistance levels available, because the market is trending above the all-time-highs, they will use fibs.\n\nAs long as there is no new information shaking up the market, the reversal will often actually happen around the fib level, because this is the easiest and most accessible tool for people to determine a price level where they will set their take-profit orders to scale out of their positions and manage their risk.\n\nThe profit-taking will slow down the trend and that in turn will catch the attention even of those traders who might not even know what “fibs” are.\n\nConsequently, very often the fib will happen as a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\nWhen Technical Analysis Doesn’t Work\n\nIf there is an unexpected important event happening, it will always shake up the markets, no matter how mature and stable they are: China bans Bitcoin? Of course. How about China banning the US Dollar, though? Of course there would be a shake-up too!\n\nWith some cryptocurrencies, the important event can be something far more prosaic, though.\n\nBack in the day when BTC was popular enough to have semi-pro trading platforms but at the same time was still really a niche thing, the daily play was to leverage the fact that the market was small enough for people with maybe five digits USD to move it and literally buy their way.\n\nSuch a thing is still possible, there is also mostly no legal danger in doing so, because cryptocurrencies are unregulated markets.\n\nThe only thing that changed here is the amount of money and skill to paint the market the way you want it.\n\nThat is a fact and because of this technical analysis can always fail.\n\nResources: Bitcoin Technical Analysis\n\nIf you want to learn about technical analysis and other smart plays for lerge-cap cryptocurrencies, go through these posts:\n\n\n  Market Timing using the combined data of “industry” leaders and aggregate data from indexes.\n  Complex patterns like Fulcrum Bottom.\n  The crowd psychology around market reversals.\n  Complex ranging plays like when following Wyckoff.\n\n\nMost Popular Cryptocurrency Trading Indicators\n\nAs a resource for your technical analysis, here is a list of the best cryptocurrency trading indicators\nthat generally work for smaller-cap cryptocurrencies too, while you can still use them for Bitcoin as well.\n\n\n  Fibonacci - as explained above, used to determine the most likely levels for price reversals, especially when it is not possible to draw support and resistance lines based on history because the price is making all-time-highs.\n  For trending crypto markets, Ichimoku cloud is invaluable - this is an article with a ton of videos and resources\n  Divergences - only used to establish a level where you should be looking for an entry, not precise enough to be a signal to enter.\n  Volume flow - a free script for TradingView available from here.\n  Scalping can be done on any kind of market, but it really needs a special kind of personality.\n  Support and resistance - the magical lines on the charts, here as a deep dive written for the forex markets but applying just the same for cryptocurrency trading.\n  Bollinger Bands - follow John Bollinger on Twitter.\n  Moving averages - a classic is 50-200 crossover, more here.\n  MACD - a classic on Reddit is a so-called squishy, bearish cross on 3D MACD.\n\n",

      content: "Daytrading is quite a broad term for the style of trading that has you enter and exit the market during a single trading session, preferably in profit.\n\nYou can be a daytrader if you engage in scalping crypto, most types of arbitrage also fall into daytrading but you can in fact aim for larger swings on the crypto markets that will need several hours to develop.\n\nIn the latter case, the border between swing trading and day trading gets a little blurry, since bitcoin market hours are 24/7/365.\n\nYou probably get the idea, though: You daytrade crypto when you flip in and out of a position within a few hours.\n\nDaytrading in crypto: The Psychology Aspect\n\nDaytrading crypto is indeed possible, but be aware that it is really a good fit only to some type of personalities.\n\n\n  If you daytrade, you need to sit down glued to the chart until your trade reaches completion.\n  Oh yeah, you need to actually have this planned quite strategically: What do you do in every possible market structure - close, wait, stop, take profit. There isn’t room for emotion or hesitating.\n  There was the magic word: Stop-Loss. You will probably want to use automatic stop loss, which means you will get stop-hunted. So if you are looking for a personal development project, try building up your strength of character to such level that you will be able to quit a losing trade without automatic stop, just on alert.\n\n\nAside from the psychology of the trader which must be compatible with this style of trade execution, let’s now look at some basic rules of the job.\n\nGo for smaller profits\n\nIf you want to close your position as soon as possible and with profit, don’t look for huge profit from every single trade.\n\nYou might find those in illiquid markets, such as when a new coin is released with much hype and the trading just opens, or in market squeezes, when there is a liquidation cascade. In both cases, those are short-lived.\n\nChoose a deeper market\n\nIf you see a high-volume breakout on the bitcoin market, check your favorite TA indicators and decide to either buy or stay out. On BTC/fiat markets your order will fill without hurdles and you will make it safely out too when you want to, at least if you’re trading on reliable outfits and not on a tiny obscure crypto exchange.\n\nIf you see a surprise parabolic growth on a small altcoin market, remember that the chances of it catching on are next to nothing, so don’t give in to FOMO. If you buy emotionally during what traders call “pump”, there might not be enough sellers later if the market is too thin for that particular cryptocurrency. The worst case scenario is getting stuck with a bag of altcoin that slowly dies out and eventually gets delisted from the exchange.\n\n\n  Don’t make excuses for being stuck with your past mistakes.\n\n\nTo put it in simple terms, most altcoin markets are simply not deep enough for technical daytrading. If you are okay with speculating on an incoming pump, you might be successful here and there, but that’s more similar to gambling than to trading. Technical daytrading for smaller profits is safer on big markets like BTC/fiat or ETH/fiat.\n\nDaytrading is the technical and strategic legwork and it also means you don’t want to hold that altcoin for months of years, so don’t use that as an excuse for being stuck in your past gambles.\n\nChoose a reliable exchange\n\nIf you are only interested in altcoins with larger markets, go for trading outfits that used to be known as “bitcoin” exchanges.\n\n\n  Bitfinex trades ETH, ETC, XMR, DASH, ZEC…\n  Kraken trades ETH, LTC, XRP, ZEC, XMR…\n\n\nFor new launches, you might find quite some on Kraken these days, but generally the thinner market plays concentrate on places like YoBit and BitTrex.\n\nIf you want to daytrade derivatives, your only liquid crypto futures option in 2019 is still BitMEX.\n\nCharting\n\nFor your crypto daytrading chart analysis needs, TradingView FREE Account will be enough unless you need timespans shorter than one minute.\n\nSummary\n\nDaytrading in the technical sense is indeed possible on cryptocurrency markets.\n\nIt is an emotionally exhausting and time-intensive work though, therefore it is not a good fit for every crypto trader.\n\nIf you still want to give daytrading a shot, you should pay attention to the choice of markets with which you’ll engage (you might find the Wyckoff avoidance strategy useful) and to what tools and platforms you’ll be using.\n",

      title: "Wyckoff Avoidance Strategy in Cryptocurrency Trading",
      content: "Wyckoff method is getting popular in the cryptocurrency space mainly because John Bollinger the author of bbands keeps recommending it on twitter.\n\nWhile it is a method that has been used heavily on legacy stock markets through a good part of the 20th century, there is no doubt it is useful for crypto as well. The versatility of the Wyckoff method lies in it being so fundamental that it is applicable in most market conditions, as far as they can be analyzed technically.\n\n@kenzboard @MrJozza Yeah, Wyckoff is as near to a universal key to understanding trading as we have.&mdash; John Bollinger (@bbands) 24 February 2017\n\n\n\nWyckoff avoidance is the value trading\n\nIn simple terms, the Wyckoff avoidance method means to trade only the best assets in the leading market sectors.\n\nCrypto is an emerging asset class, but there are already ways of determining which cryptocurrency has fundamental value. Focusing on the opportunities in those markets makes your decisions process much clearer:\n\n\n  You want to buy/hold a fundamentally valuable asset when its price is not reflecting its value yet.\n  You want to take profits and abandon an asset that is appreciating in the short term because of things like tiny market inefficiency or news hype.\n\n\nAltcoin Trading Strategy: How strong a coin is\n\nFrom StockCharts, talking about trading legacy stocks with Wyckoff avoidance method:\n\n\n  The Wyckoffian mission is to trade and invest in the best stocks in the leading Industry Groups. We have been studying examples of leadership characteristics using Wyckoff Analysis in combination with relative strength [of industry assets as compared with one another]. Always be seeking the strongest stocks in the strongest groups [but also] study the asset groups that are stalling and falling from favor.\n\n\nThe key point is that a leader of an asset group does not stay the leader forever.\n\nAt some point the leader leaves the limelight, becomes a laggard and may stay a laggard for some time. That’s where the Wyckoff avoidance strategy brings a lot of use even for your Hodl stash and long term trades that need periodic re-evaluation. If you spot the transition of a leader to a laggard you are still left with heaps of time to gradually exit the market and decide on your next move.\n\nFinding the market weakness\n\nYou can use any of your favorite technical analysis tools that are good for spotting the weakness of a market - divergences would be a very early sign (and possibly a misleading one) but combined with a three-push formation and lower highs when seen relative to the Bollinger bands would be more reliable.\n\nThe general technical gist is that this transition is a substantial one, you should be looking for it on longer timeframes (daily, 3D or weekly charts). The market structure will be similar in all assets in the group you are looking at, but the weakening leader would display the crumbling more strongly.\n\nSelect assets that are in harmony with the market\n\nAnother important point in Wyckoff avoidance is to select assets that move in harmony with the market. The bigger picture and relations between different assets of the same class is often overlooked, but it is incredibly useful also for market timing.\n\nIn terms of Wyckoff avoidance, the rule boils down simply to the following:\n\n\n  In a bull (uptrend) market, select [assets] that are stronger than the market itself. In a bear market choose those that are weaker than the market itself.\n\n\nAssuming we are in a broad crypto bull market, if you can find cryptocurrencies that are performing consistently strong and if you can also find their counterparts, you have your best candidates for your long and short positions:\n\n\n  Strong cryptoassets rally quite easily. After the rally comes a retrace, but some of the gains remain.\n  Weak cryptoassets don’t rally consistently. If they do, the retrace kills all the gains.\n\n\nOn legacy markets, it is easy to compare an asset against a composite index: In a bull market, if an asset trades still well below a known resistance line and gains more than the index, it’s typically the strong performer.\n\nThe play there is to buy this particular asset, avoiding all the rest of the assets in its group.\n\nThe technically suggested time to sell comes when the price approaches a resistance area. Then you can look which stock was performing poorly in the rally: It’s is going to be the one that should drop the most in the coming retrace and therefore it is technically the best candidate for a short.\n\nWe now also have composite indexes in cryptocurrency markets, but the information you can get from them is still fairly questionable. Remember, the crypto markets are still very new. More on crypto indexes in our Strategy article about market timing.\n\nGoing back to individual coins\n\nTo find the inceptions of changes in the market, you will have to go back to individual cryptocurrencies and look for topping patterns and reversals.\n\nIf you are a trading beginner, you can use free charting tools like Cryptowatch or TradingView, get a BTCUSD chart with Parabolic SAR, RSI and MACD indicators and go backwards to learn how past trend reversals looked. Then you can compare it with what ETHUSD was doing in that time, and then perhaps XRPUSD and smaller altcoins.\n\nThe hourly bitcoin chart below shows Parabolic SAR set to 0.025, 0.02, 0.03 on TradingView. If you click on the picture to zoom it you’ll see it flipping, and if you look at the RSI at the bottom you’ll see a divergence between the RSI lows and the price lows, which is bullish as it shows the lows are too low for the strength of the market.\n\nWhen technical analysis fails\n\nFrom a 2017 Financial Times article (archived link without paywall), most likely about the OKEx futures exchange:\n\n“Daniel Masters, the founder of one of the world’s first bitcoin funds – Jersey-based Global Advisors Bitcoin Investment Program (GABI) – is calling for position limits on bitcoin exchanges, after falling prey to a heinous case of cash-to-futures basis manipulation in February, when bitcoin soared to new record high.\n\nOur position was liquidated at $767 and, needless to say, by the time we were back in the market the price was shooting back above $900. This was of course an extremely unfortunate state of affairs in which to find ourselves and a hard lesson learned. Accordingly, we lost around 10% of performance against our benchmark, the USD price of bitcoin.\n\nThe matters set out above highlighted another issue with bitcoin trading, which up until this point we had not considered. After the price drop, one player emerged as totally dominant in the open interest of the futures contract.\n\nIt seemed pretty clear to us as a result that this event was not just a normal version of a large liquidation, with which we are familiar, but was a premeditated attack. When the dust settled, one unidentified player was short well over half the open interest.\n\nWe would therefore class this episode as clear market manipulation, and in fact it was not just momentary: for many days thereafter the basis was so weak that it seemed that the one attack was being followed up by periodic smaller attacks.\n\nAs such we approached the exchange. They confirmed to us that there were no position limits whatsoever and that people were free to do whatever they wanted in their “happy trading environment” (yes, they used those actual words). We made it very clear that such activity, whether in a regulated environment or not, might amount to criminality in Hong Kong and would certainly do so in many other jurisdictions.\n\nFollowing a number of discussions, the exchange encouraged the ‘rogue’ player to withdraw and things have now normalized.”\n\nSo, as a last note: Don’t be naive. Of course it’s happening.\n\n\n\nResources\n\n\n  Wyckoff: Determining Relative Strength And Weakness on technical.traders.com\n  Charting for Wyckoff method on stockcharts.com\n\n",

      title: "Crypto vs Forex Trading: How do they compare?",
      content: "“Should I move from forex market to crypto?” This has been one of the most common questions asked by forex traders, especially since the boom of cryptocurrencies in late 2017.\n\nTrade tokenized stock and forex markets on FTX exchange. 5% fee off with code altcointrading\n\nThe year 2017 meant a breakthrough for bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Along with the wild changes in prices on the market, the business of crypto trading grew accordingly.\n\nThe years 2018 and 2019 saw the opposite move: Crypto traders bored with ranging market going nowhere started venturing into forex, oil and other legacy markets.\n\nOne thing remains though: Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies moved from a niche curiosity propped by obscure online forums to the radar of everybody who invests or trades on the markets.\n\nThe Difference between Forex and Crypto Market\n\nIf you were previously fx trading, cryptocurrencies in their early stage probably weren’t attractive to you. You were used to the access to hundreds of forex pairs across majors, minors, exotics and metals. There was enough fun.\n\nIf you out of curiosity still made the decision to sample the trading of Bitcoin, other leading leading or even emerging altcoins, you must have noticed how different even the most mature among the crypto markets are from forex.\n\nIn the next section we’ll be comparing the differences, pros and cons of forex and crypto trading to help you make an informed decision on your trading future.\n\nIf instead of that you want to delve deeper into the technical analysis tools crypto traders like to use, here is a few options:\n\n\n  Ichimoku Cloud: The indicator was adopted from stock market for crypto markets that don’t close for the weekends, and so Ichimoku Cloud as an indicator that works with timespans often gets used with crypto-specific settings.\n  Wyckoff trading: Wyckoff method is used in stock markets rather than in forex trading because they tend to have stronger directional trends with the occasional range, and at least until this point cryptocurrencies have been similar in that. To a technical forex trader, learning about Wyckoff could be quite useful.\n  Orderbook heatmaps &amp; Co: On the contrary to Wyckoff, scalping in crypto will be in some way similar to the gist of fast-paced forex trading. In crypto though, we have better and more accessible advanced tools for short-term trading strategies.\n\n\nForex vs. Bitcoin and Crypto Trading\n\nJust in case you are entirely new to the concept of cryptocurrencies, these refer to a medium of digital assets that utilize algorithms and cryptography to generate and verify transactions of value.\n\nSome cryptoassets are used primarily as money, some primarily as technical platforms.\n\nNonetheless, even today the crypto market is still not mature and stratified enough to make it reasonable to consider altcoin markets separately from bitcoin markets.\n\nCrypto Trading: Pros and Cons\n\n\n  pros\n\n\n\n  The gains. We might as well face it that the gains some people made on the crypto markets from a tiny starting bank would be extremely unlikely to ever happen in forex. Trading cryptocurrencies has been a lucrative proposition for investors that know the right time to enter and exit the markets. However, remember that there have been just as many losses.\n  The same level of leverage as in forex, except on markets with far more pronounced moves. Leveraged trading can cause a lot of damage. On the other hand, the completely free accessibility of leverage up to 100x on platforms like BitMEX that don’t even require you to state your name open up a host of possibilities. You can open straddle positions or set up risk-free collecting of swap funding payments. Remember that you need to have discipline and keep your cool though.\n  Availability of lending. Staying with the previous points, the range of the possibilities depends on your location but in general you can decide to lend your crypto or fiat currencies in a more or less unregulated way. The lack of regulation also means lower costs of running business because there is less need for lawyers and insurers, and therefore the trading fees and other costs that eat from your profits are lower than on regulated markets.\n  The admin of crypto trading is similar enough to forex. You can even use the same Excel spreadsheet for your crypto trading logs as you do for forex. Just swap the forex markets for crypto ones, all the other fields and metrics are the same as on forex markets.\n\n\n\n  cons\n\n\n\n  Lack of historical data. Cryptocurrency markets are very new, their valuation has been changing explosively in both directions and excluding peer-to-peer, during the first few years crypto trading was isolated to a single trading platform. For anyone trying to backtest a trading algo or just learn about typical market patterns, there is not enough historical data to use as key support and resistance levels.\n  Cryptocurrencies are more volatile. Some traders like price volatility - some even trade volatility rather than price direction. But some might say that cryptocurrencies are too volatile and it’s an almighty challenge to find suitable entry and exit points.\n  Strong influence of the unpredictable market sentiment. Cryptos were on an uptrend in 2017 and then they  swapped to a downtrend in 2018. This rather normal occurrence had many call the end of cryptocurrencies, not to mention the endless news about which country is trying to ban crypto again this week.\n\n\nForex Trading: Pros and Cons\n\n\n  pros\n\n\n\n  24-hour accessibility on work days. Forex traders can enjoy 24-hour access to all forex pairs with real-time pricing, charts and tools during the work week. In many ways it can be good to have a weekend, if only to plan with a clear head what to do on  market open.\n  Market leverage. Forex has been known for tight ranges and therefore the widespread use of leverage to maximize trading profits. Common forex leverages are up to 100x, depending on your broker.\n  Unrivaled liquidity. The forex market is undoubtedly the most liquid market in financial trading; it is the easiest market to open and close positions with speed.\n\n\n\n  cons\n\n\n\n  Forex is not ideal for smaller trading banks. In truth, the forex market is largely made up of hedge funds and trading groups. Given the small percentage moves on forex pairs, you need a sizable trading bank to generate respectable returns.\n  Unpredictable volatility. Forex markets are called “legacy” which implies something stable, but they can be just as volatile as cryptocurrency markets. Indeed there are moments of extreme volatility in forex, particularly surrounding political events.\n\n\nComparing the Opportunities on Forex and Crypto Markets\n\nIn truth, there is a place for crypto and forex trading in all our trading arsenals. Do not expect to come from forex markets, apply your usual forex trading strategy in crypto, walk away with millions after a week and retire early.\n\nCrypto markets are different from forex markets, even though cryptos are also currencies.\n\nOn the other hand, non-directional strategies that manage your risk are available far more easily and at less costs on the crypto markets - it is just human nature that this lack of constraints also attracts foolish risking.\n\nUltimately, it’s about picking the right battles and knowing the right time to use them when the risk factors are on your side.\n",

      title: "How to Compare the Fundamental Value of Cryptoassets",
      content: "The fundamental value of a cryptocurrency is not declared by any authority, it derives from how they are used.\n\nAs the blockchain space grows though, frameworks have been developed to categorize types of cryptoassets. Even though a clear enough framework is still not in place and so the regulatory issues are probably going to stick around for a bit longer, using the classification that is already available can still help you decide whether you actually want to enter that market or not.\n\nTypes of altcoins\n\nIn 2016, when the first alt season started, the community liked to focus on differences in technology.\n\nNamely, which technology is the most novel, disruptive or revolutionary.  Ethereum came about like this, prior to ETH there was no asset to act as a fuel for decentralized apps.\n\nBy 2018, we had hundreds of (somewhat) active cryptocurrency projects, each sporting an interesting technology tweak, but none having much practical use - perhaps with the exception of decentralized gaming.\n\nThe relative success of dApp games indicated the focus shift from the tech onto how is the tech used.\n\nThis is where we still are today: The underlying technology is secondary; it may be the best known way to implement the function of the cryptocurrency but the function is decided first.\n\nCrypto-Money\n\nCryptocurrencies as means of payment\n\nSome altcoins were developed as means of payment, in the same sense as Bitcoin was developed as means of payment.\n\nA cryptocurrency developed as crypto-money addresses certain weaknesses of the conventional payment system.\n\nOne such issue is the inability to exchange money freely, even if it’s to an entity located in a far-away country that maybe doesn’t like your country’s president or religion.\n\nThis problem can also occur internally within a single country, in an attempt of total control over how individuals spend: Here is a comment from 2018, where an upper middle class person in Argentina received an accusation in tax fraud because the revenue office does not believe she does not have a hired house cleaner. In the context of Argentina, the idea was probably to keep people from getting rid of the national currency which was on the brink of collapse at that time.\n\nBitcoin can address most of the payment-related issues in the fiat world.\n\nAlternative cryptocurrencies developed for payments typically attempt, in turn, to solve one of the “weaknesses” of Bitcoin:\n\n\n  Implementing full privacy to advance the pseudonymous nature of Bitcoin (XMR)\n  Focusing on scaling and transaction throughput (BCH, EOS, XRP)\n  Lowering the energy consumptions of mining (PoS coins)\n  Making transactions faster and cheap or even free (LTC, IOT)\n\n\nRealistically, pseudonymous transactions and the transaction fee are only a problem for a subset of your normal everyday financial transactions.\n\nClearly XMR and full-privacy cryptocurrencies are a niche case. It is also not unreasonable to expect that BTC will be used for larger transactions, such as buying a house with Bitcoin, while tiny transactions would run on an alternative blockchain, such as ones between IoT devices.\n\nThe value of payment-focused cryptocurrencies derives from the strength of the network - traders follow metrics like network activity, number of ATMs, the size of the OTC market, payment implementations.\n\nInteresting Crypto-Money altcoins:\n\n\n  Monero\n\n\nMonero is scalable and mined in a decentralized fashion because XMR mining is done via GPU which limits the usage of ASICs (application-specific circuits).\n\nMonero payments are unlinkable, untraceable, fully anonymous and mineable on any device with a little bit of redundant computational power. That makes XMR the preferred cryptocurrency for cryptojacking, the easiest way to monetize illicit access into someone else’s device or sever.\n\n\n  DASH\n\n\nDash is short for digital cash. The pivotal properties of DASH are anonymous blockchain and masternode system. The privacy system is less bulletproof than the one of Monero but the implementation of payment gateways is more widespread because implementing DASH requires less work than implementing Monero.\n\n\n  Litecoin\n\n\nLTC used to be the second most popular altcoin before cryptocurrencies like ETH and XRP emerged. It was created to handle massive transaction volumes but so far, it was mostly used as a guinea pig for Bitcoin blockchain innovations due to the similarity of the two. Along with DOGE, it has been since its inception used by traders to move money between exchanges for less fees.\n\nCrypto-Fuel\n\nCryptocurrencies as dApp tokens\n\nSome altcoins were developed as communication tokens: Whoever wants to engage with a decentralized app (dApp) needs to use an appropriate token to do that.\n\nWhile that is still the case, on the part of the user it does not need to involve holding dozens of separate tokens since we have projects like Kyber Network that can do atomic token swaps between different tokenized assets.\n\nCrypto tokens are still publicly traded and used for speculation.\n\nVitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum, never endorsed ETH as a storage value. Why are these tokens speculated so much then? The Internet will point you to the Blue ocean Strategy.\n\nWhen ETH first emerged, traders argued that crypto-fuel tokens were downplaying the monetary value of the coin on purpose: To show that it is not just another “better money”. Tokens are a new category, one that first came to existence with blockchain, and demand for this type of asset was quickly created.\n\nThe value of crypto-fuel tokens is expected to surge with the demand, but ideally with an actual (non-speculative) demand. The non-speculative demand is still awaited to arrive one day in the future though.\n\nInteresting Crypto-Fuel altcoins:\n\n\n  Ether, ERC-20 fungible tokens\n\n\nEthereum is the original blockchain for the execution of complicated smart contracts. (Simple smart contracts like an escrow can run on the Bitcoin blockchain as well.)\n\nAt first, ETH was deemed the scalable cryptocurrency with fast and cheap transactions. This view was quickly shattered when gaming dApps became popular and started flooding the blockchain with data. Then came the ICO bubble, likewise showing how easy it is to make Ethereum transactions slow and expensive.\n\nWe have since got a new generation of app-platform cryptocurrencies that focus on scalability (EOS, ZIL) and we also got the sidechain implementation which allows for existence of decentralized cryptoasset exchanges and blockchain games that do not spam the network and are free to use.\n\nA quick note about investing into tokens: Large amount of people hold Ethereum or tokens for investment. There in infinite amount of Ether to be mined but the inflation is kept low. Some argue that after the switch to PoS the monetary value of ETH could stabilize and make a good store of value.\n\nCrypto-Vouchers\n\nCryptoassets that can be exchanged for another predefined asset\n\nStablecoins belong to this category: They are assets living on blockchain that have a value redeemable in another asset, like IOUs.\n\nThere can be IOUs for other assets than money, though. A cryptocurrency can also be a tokenized access to service or an ecommerce gift card.\n\nSecurity Tokens\n\nThe concept of utility vs security token is still new.\n\nIt is a regulatory term used for tokens that represent an investment in entrepreneurial efforts of someone else, much like investing in stocks. This type of tokens is becoming regulated because they resemble stocks, an already regulated asset.\n\nIn the concept of a “decentralized organization”, anyone can become a “shareholder” by buying a token. The work of the organization is then focused on revenue generation in whatever the company decides to call their profit unit.\n\nThe monetary value of the token changes based on the organization’s revenues.\n\n\n  BitShares, DAO\n\n\nBitShares was the first platform coming up with the concept of decentralized organization.\n\nThe idea later became infamous with the fall of DAO, which was hacked but the consequences of the hack were mitigated by the ETH hard fork that produced ETC.\n\nShitcoins\n\nThe last category of alternative cryptocurrencies are shitcoins.\n\nIt should be noted that some people will want to call perhaps EOS or Tezos a shitcoin, but they do not fall into this category.\n\nLegitimate shitcoins are not a product of a cryptoasset project that somehow failed or disappointed, shitcoins are the cryptoassets that never had any value proposition in the first place.\n\nWe do see less of them now in the blockchain space. It is a now forgotten part of history but in 2016, the golden era of Poloniex, we did have coins that were seriously only created as an ego-blast of someone who could afford to pay the programmer. Max Keiser had his own coin, MaxCoin.\n\nIf you checked a shitcoin’s website, you would see random strings of meaningless buzzwords, such as\n\n\n  Vcash was engineered to be innovative and forward-thinking. It prevents eavesdropping and censorship, promotes decentralized, energy efficient and instant network transactions. (- Taken from now defunct vanillacoin.net)\n\n\nThe value of shitcoins was always purely speculative. They might pump and you might be coming early enough to cash in but that’s it.\n\nThe 2017 edition of the shitcoin mania was the end of the ICO bubble - fake token sales with barely a landing page, fake LinkedIn profiles with fake names of fake team members, no plans to ever develop anything.\n\nThe actual people behind the scams would collect the crowdfunding and vanish, and like with every bubble there were some brave traders who earned good money flipping tokens of proven scams on the greater fool.\n\nStarting from 2018 we see less of this activity - not because of regulation, but because of how crowded the gravy train of token offerings has gotten.\n\nIt is increasingly difficult to stand out just like it is increasingly difficult to pump and dump maturing cryptocurrencies.\n\nReferences\n\nBURNIE, Andrew; BURNIE, James; HENDERSON, Andrew.

You can use it on any timeframe and play with the length of the span.\n\nOn the 1W DPO gives an easy single-glance information about the market:\n\n\n\nEven better, it is worth noting that the information you get from the color changes is equivalent to the cross of the Bollinger Band middle line on Bollinger Bands of the same length.\n\nHere on a 1W chart for the lengths of 28:\n\n\n\nFor very long-term crypto charts this is actually more convenient that the bbands, if you are only looking for the position of the price relative to the mean.\n\nYou’ll notice I had to switch off the auto sizing on the chart because due to the periods of cryptocurrency bubbles, the lower and upper Bollinger bands shoot too far.\n\nIt won’t be a very difficult job to add candle coloring for the lower and upper Bollinger band crosses either, by the way.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe Detrended Price Oscillator is indeed similar to SMAs. The information is presented by coloring the chart candles though, which means you don’t have to squint your eyes at the chart when investigating trend cycles.\n\nA marginal advantage but if you have a chart with no candle-coloring script in place, this would be a good choice.\n\n\n",

      title: "Why Are So Many People Trading Cryptocurrency?",
      content: "Cryptocurrencies might be new, but they’ve shown great potential to change our world’s future.\n\nIt’s a disruptive technology that promises outstanding returns. The small investments you put into cryptocurrency can grow into life-changing profits over a couple of years. This is the main reason why you should be interested in trading cryptocurrency.\n\n\n\nGoogle Trends organic stats for “crypto trading” in US / 2019\n\nThe success of trading cryptocurrencies can only be possible if you’ve done your research and developed a good trading strategy. You should also be wise if you find some great tips on cryptocurrency trading from the internet before you start trading.\n\nNevertheless, do work on your good practice and don’t forget to double-check even the information shared in the following trading tips.\n\nHere are a few reasons that we think are the major driving forces behind the increasing popularity of cryptocurrency trading.\n\nCryptocurrency Markets Have Higher Volatility\n\nVolatility means the variation of the trading prices over a certain period of time. The majority of stocks in the stock market have much less volatility than cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies went through a lot of volatility because of short-term speculative interest from investors. One good example of such volatility was seen from October 2017 to October 2018, where Bitcoin’s value rose as high as $19,378 and fell down to $5,851.\n\nThe higher the volatility is, the riskier it’ll be. But this is what makes cryptocurrencies exciting and trending. Because of cryptocurrency’s high volatility, you have the chance to earn more than half of your initial investment in just a couple of days when you start trading.\n\nThe prices of cryptocurrencies are changing every minute. The rapid variations of these prices provide a lot of opportunities for traders to either go long or short when trading. This is even better for short-term swing traders or day traders because cryptocurrencies, like Ethereum, tend to move from 5%-10% in just a day.\n\nYes, the risks are high, but if you’ve done your research and understand how to trade cryptocurrencies, you won’t mind them at all because you’re looking at the bigger picture, which is great profits.\n\nCryptocurrency Is Now Accepted In Commercial Transactions\n\nDuring the early days of cryptocurrency trading, the only option is to store your cryptocurrencies while trading them. Although they can be withdrawable, most users opt to keep them in their wallets. But today, many businesses and organizations are adding crypto as a part of their payment systems.\n\nMoreover, other forms of digital currencies can now be exchanged into cryptocurrency, which is a compelling way to dive into crypto without using your money directly. For example, you can earn digital coins through having an active lifestyle, and convert Sweatcoin to USD price or exchange your money through cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and XYO.\n\nHow does it work? First, you’ll need to download the app to make sure that you’re recording your physical activity. For every 1000 steps that you take, you can earn 0.95 Sweatcoins (SWC). As you accumulate your SWC, you can have them converted into the methods discussed.\n\nBecause of the convenience and safety of transacting with crypto, it’s only a matter of time until more businesses adapt it into their payment system. For now, it’s still a challenge for the commerce industry as its conditions and safety as a regulated payment system are yet to be defined.\n\nThe Volatility Of Cryptocurrencies Makes For More Trading Opportunities\n\nThis is really one of the controversial reasons why many people are trading cryptocurrency since not everyone has managed to do it successfully. There are plenty of stories around the internet about how people ploughed their entire life savings into cryptocurrencies only to lose it all.\n\nBut this will only happen if you dove into cryptocurrencies without doing your research and coming up with a good strategy. You need to be smart and cautious when trading cryptocurrencies so you can earn more money from your initial investment.\n\nIf you do it the right way, you get the chance to double or maybe even triple your earnings when you start trading cryptocurrencies. The high volatility of cryptocurrencies will make it possible for you to buy a digital currency at a low price today and sell it when its value soars up again after a couple of days.\n\nCryptocurrency Markets Are Available 24/7\n\nStock markets only open on weekdays and for a couple of hours a day. Cryptocurrency markets, on the other hand, are available 24/7 and you can access them anywhere in the world.\n\nThis is perfect for traders who have a daytime job. You can trade cryptocurrencies after going home from work or you can do it during the weekends. It’s hard for a trader with a daytime job to be active on the stock market since it only opens when most people are at work.\n\nYou can trade cryptocurrency anytime and anywhere because its market has decentralized governance. This means that it doesn’t have a single regulatory board that oversees and manages it.\n\nThis means that you don’t need to follow or comply to a schedule to make a trade since you can do it anytime of the day, making it more convenient than trading in the stock market.\n\nNo Trading Limit or “Pattern Day Trading Rule”\n\nThe pattern day trading rule is a law that prohibits you to do more than 3-day trades in 5 business days if you have less than $25,000 in your account in stock markets. This is a bit of a bummer for traders who likes to get the most out of their investments since it limits their trading activities.\n\nBut there’s no such rule observed when trading cryptocurrencies. Even if you only have $200 in your account, you can trade as many cryptocurrencies as you want every day. What this means is that if you’ve developed a strategy to trade cryptocurrencies successfully, you’ll have the potential to grow your $200 much faster than trading in stock markets.\n\nAlgo and Tech Equipment Is Not Needed\n\nAnother reason why many people are trading cryptocurrency is because of the convenience it provides. You don’t need a supercomputer with 4 monitors to start trading cryptocurrencies. You can trade crypto straight from your mobile phone.\n\nThere are many cryptocurrency exchanges or platforms out there that have a great mobile app with plenty of features and executions, which makes trading from your mobile device much easier.\n\nAdditionally many platforms now have a copy trading feature, which allows you to mimic the trades of expert traders, thus investing in crypto becomes even more easier.\n\nThe best exchange mobile apps are built around API access. That means you can for instance only allow lending in your phone app, but not trading or withdrawals. Apps built like that offer a very good level of security.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn today’s job market where wages get stagnant and finding a job becomes really hard, the vast majority of people would very much welcome an extra source of income. It can help take off some pressure from your bills that are piling up or treat yourself to a nice vacation - that is the main motivation behind the bulk of retail interest in trading crypto.\n\nHowever, if you’re not careful when trading cryptocurrency, you may find yourself in a rough spot and eventually lose all of your investment.\n\nCryptocurrency trading is not a game. There’s real money for you to earn but there’s also real money for you to lose. As for any type of investment, it’s always wise to risk only what you can lose.\n\nDo your research to improve your understanding of how the cryptocurrency market works so you can avoid the pitfalls of trading cryptocurrency.\n\nMost people who are trading cryptocurrency are in it for the money. If done properly, it’s indeed a great way of making big money. Just be aware of the risks beforehand and always stick to a reasonable strategy.\n",

      title: "Divergences in Crypto Trading (Divergence Cheat Sheet inside)",
      content: "What are divergences in trading?\n\nWhen traders talk about divergences, or divs, they are pointing out a disagreement between the price action and an oscillating technical indicator.\n\nThe indicator of choice is typically MACD, OBV, RSI, stochRSI or similar.\n\nDivergences point to a momentum in the market. Depending on the type of the divergence they suggest either continuation or reversal.\n\nHow to find a divergence on a chart\n\n\n  Open the crypto market that interests you in a charting app like TradingView (free tier is fine).\n  Load in an oscillator (in TradingView, the “f” icon in top left). Most crypto traders look for RSI divergences on the StochRSI indicator.\n  The thing to look for in the price action are highs and lows. Pick a pair of prominent highs if the market is trending up. Pick a pair of prominent lows if the market is trending down.\n  Look at the indicator in the same area (just below your pair of highs or lows). Check if your indicator printed a mirror image: If the price made higher high, look for lower high in the indicator.\n\n\nDivergence Cheat Sheet\n\n\n  Comprehensive Divergences Cheat-sheet  with proper explanations. It is valid for all oscillating indicators, you can use it to evaluate MACD divergences as well as RSI divergences.\n\n\n\n\nHow to interpret divergences\n\nWe distinguish regular divergence, hidden divergence and exaggerated divergence.\n\nRegular divergence\n\nRegular Divergence is a sign of trend reversal: Price keeps the trend but oscillator is already showing the momentum is weakening.\n\n\n  \n    Bearish Regular Divergence\n\n    Bearish Regular Divergence is a signal to short.\n\n    Price makes higher high but oscillator makes lower high. This shows the onset of market weakness, possible exhaustion at the end of a bull trend.\n\n    Look for bearish regular divergence in tops.\n  \n  \n    Bullish Regular Divergence\n\n    Bullish Regular Divergence is a signal to long.\n\n    Price makes lower low but oscillator makes higher low. Underlying strength, possible bottoming in progress.\n\n    Look for bullish regular divergence in bottoms.\n  \n\n\nHidden divergence\n\nHidden Divergence is a divergence that follows the trend on longer time frames (1D, 1W). Hidden divs show the market is inclined to continue the current overarching trend and that the current short-term action is just a retracement, but likely not a reversal.\n\n\n  \n    Bearish hidden divergence\n\n    Bearish hidden divergence is a signal to short.\n\n    Price makes lower highs but oscillator makes higher highs. Tends to be found in bounces within a downtrend.\n\n    Look for hidden divergence in local tops within a downtrend.\n  \n  \n    Bullish hidden divergence\n\n    Bullish hidden divergence is a signal to long.\n\n    Price makes higher low but oscillator makes lower low. Tends to be found during continuation pauses in an uptrend.\n\n    Look for bullish hidden divergence in bottoms on retracements.\n  \n\n\nExaggerated divergence\n\nExaggerated Divergence is different only in that price makes double top or double bottom rather than a single new high or a single new low.\n\n\n\nHow to trade on divergences in crypto\n\nDivergences only show a level where to wait for your entry signal.\n\nThe logic behind divergences is that sometimes oscillating indicators show nascent tendencies of the market (strength or weakness) that might not be visible from the price action yet.\n\nHowever, this is not a sharp enough indication to signal the actual entry.\n\nIt gives the idea about the direction you should be looking for when looking for an entry on that timeframe but you will need to dig deeper and switch to shorter timeframes to find a good entry.\n\nTrading only on divergences increases your risk unnecessarily, divergences are too vague.\n\nHere’s more on Crypto Divergences by Josh Olszewicz\n\n\n\nWhich oscillator to use for divergences\n\n\n  \n    OBV divergence Volume vs Price\n\n    We wrote a ScriptSpotlight on OBV vs price divergences here.\n  \n  \n    Price vs MACD Divergence, standard settings\n\n    This is a regular bullish divergence on an old ETHUSD chart.\n\n    \n  \n  \n    Price vs StochRSI Divergence\n\n    This is a 1D chart of BTCUSD, Bitfinex. The StochRSI shows hidden bearish divergence, the momentum is set to continue the bearish trend.\n\n    \n  \n  \n    Price vs %b Divergence, BBands 21 periods - stdev 3\n\n    Divergence with %b is a more precise way to observe whether new extremes of the price action are closer to or farther from the bollinger band’s boundaries. There is a more reliable version of the double bottom formation on the bbands: price makes a new low but that now is not a new low relatively to the bbands. That is to say, the first low is below the lower bband and the second low is a lower low in absolute terms (the price) but also either on or above the lower bband - video on bbands explaining that in this article.\n\n    TradingView provides the %b indicator which measures how far is the price from the bollinger band of your selected standard deviation and it plots this distance. The situation where you have new low in price but not a new low relatively to the bands shows as a regular bullish divergence on %b.\n\n    Get TradingView FREE\n\n    This is a 2H chart of BTCUSD, Bitfinex - the same period as the previous one on 1D. Having bearish divergences on a longer timeframe and a bullish divergence on a shorter one shows a short recovery might be in the cards but the bulls aren’t winning yet.\n\n    \n  \n\n\nBest Charting Tool for Divergences\n\nFor the ultra lazy? TradingView public library has a couple of automated divergence indicators. You won’t need to look for your divergences, the script will find them for you.\n\nYou’ll need an account to access the auto-divergence indicators, but TradingView FREE will be enough.\n\nOther Resources On Price/Oscillator Divergences\n\n\n  Basic divergences cheatsheet from BabyPips\n\n\n\n\n\n  ”dukascopy.com / Do you know everything about divergences?”\n\n",

      title: "Cryptocurrency Strategy for Beginners",
      content: "Let’s face the music right away.\n\nTrading Is Not For Everyone\n\nAnd it’s not just that crypto trading is not for everyone.\n\nEven if you have enough skill or edge to trade, very often there is just not a good opportunity to open a trade.\n\nThe market is choppy, there are stop hunts, the volume is too thin.\n\nSo then, can you profit from your crypto holdings even if you don’t want to trade?\n\nThe answer is you can with a basic crypto strategy, but be warned. For the most part it requires you to be ultra-longterm bullish on crypto.\n\nLet’s take a look at the options you have.\n\n1/ Build a “hodl” strategy\n\nThis is the simplest method ever.\n\nThe “buy and hold” strategy is the staple of retail legacy finance as well. In crypto, the idea is the same, except you apply it on a cryptoasset instead of on a stock.\n\nOh, and we call it “hodl” in crypto, not “hold”.\n\nBeginner HODL Crypto Strategy\n\n\n  Find a crypto with good fundamentals: network effect, resistance to bad news, a use case showing that it’s more than a vaporware.\n  Once you find cryptocurrencies you want to keep, decide on how long you are willing to hold them. Ballpark is good enough: A decade? A year?\n  Split that period and make a mental note on how often you will re-evaluate your investment. You can go with seasonal cycles, as long as they are relevant. Crypto traders all week all year, but there are seasonal things like the halving cycle of Bitcoin.\n  Every time your point of re-evaluation comes, you can decide to rebalance and take out some amount from your profits, or to cut your losses, or to just keep holding everything.\n\n\nIf you are wondering about how much to invest and how to pick the best time to buy - that’s already speculation. If you are a beginner, you will do best with DCA, which is dollar cost averaging.\n\nYour Toolbox\n\nTo execute a beginner HODL strategy, you will probably need some of these:\n\n\n  Skim through our Guide on Buying Altcoins - with KYC, with no KYC.\n    \n      Recommended crypto exchange to buy From is Independent Reserve, if you go the KYC route.\n      Recommended non-KYC place to buy from is LocalCryptos, the P2P marketplace for crypto.\n    \n  \n  Get the basics of Dollar Cost Averaging. For a true beginner strategy you will want to avoid price speculation. Too many people fall into the trap of “I will buy when it drops” and never get started.\n    \n      Two places where you can easily automate your regular purchases are Independent Reserve (real crypto) and the Revolut App (investing vehicle only, impossible to withdraw).\n    \n  \n  Get a good crypto wallet, that’s where you will hodl your coin. The commercial ones get on sale a few times a year.\n\n\n2/ Crypto Lending\n\nIf you have more than a tiny amount of Bitcoins (or Ether, or any other cryptocurrency that is traded on custodial exchanges), you can lend it to traders on most exchanges that run margin trading.\n\nYou will earn interest in cryptocurrency directly into your exchange wallet.\n\nThe best trading platform to do that is Bitfinex, thanks to their new Lending PRO interface.\n\nBeginner Crypto Lending Strategy\n\n\n  Sign up at an exchange that does margin lending. This is a link to Bitfinex, there you go.\n  Decide on the size of your lending stack. All your wallet’s contents? Part of it? It’s up to you.\n    \n      Lending itself has next to no risk, but the platform through which you lend may get hacked.\n    \n  \n  Decide what is the lowest acceptable rate for you. A good one is a daily rate of 0.03 which gives you 10% return per year.\n  Monitor the daily rates. If the rates increase, lend all your stack! If the rates get below your threshold, lend less and take the rest out into your crypto wallet.\n\n\nYour Toolbox\n\n\n  Margin Lending: Full template and formulas for your interest rates calculation can be found in ATNET Strategy on Lending\n  Other options: Lending platforms like Ethlend, where you can lend a range of some 250 ERC-20 tokens.\n  Automation: If you don’t want to manually manage the lending rates, a crypto lending bot can take care of it either for free or for a fee. The platform 3commas offers easily configurable crypto trading bots.\n\n\n3/ Run a Masternode\n\nWith masternode management we are getting into the territory of strategies that are simple to pull of, but they require upfront investment.\n\nMasternode is a cryptocurrency full node with a wallet that keeps the full copy of the blockchain. By that it supports the coin’s network.\n\nA masternode must be always up and running and is required to perform certain tasks for the cryptocurrency network. You as the masternode owner get a payout in your node’s currency as a compensation for this.\n\nAs already mentioned, running a masternode also requires an upfront investment.\n\nYou will need to buy the node’s currency and hold it in the node wallet as a minimum to start running your node as a masternode.\n\nObviously you don’t want to be stuck with a shitcoin. Make sure you do your proper due diligence and judge the coin’s value carefully.\n\n4/ Staking\n\nStaking might be the easiest way to get extra income on a cryptocurrencies you hold. Clearly, as with masternode management, you need to hold the crypto in question.\n\nOur note about value judgement is just as relevant here.\n\nOnce you decided a currency has value for the long run, staking requires no strategy or evaluation - you are primarily collecting more of the coin.\n\nYou can stake even OG cryptos\n\nIn order to stake a cryptocurrency, it has to follow the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.\n\nBut in 2020, there are variations of “wrapped” cryptocurrencies. That means you can also stake bitcoin in its wrapped form, or even a fiat currency.\n\nStaking is not too profitable\n\nIn the past you could earn up to 10% extra coins in a year by just holding and staking them. As the barrier to start staking gradually became lower, the earnings also decreased.\n\nAs of 2020, for the more mainstream cryptocurrencies you will earn better by lending them via margin funding.\n\nIf you still want to do it…\n\nYour Toolbox\n\n\n  The crypto trading platform Kraken is one of the most legit places that lets you do that.\n  If you prefer non-KYC platforms, Bitfinex lets you stake automatically after depositing a stakeable cryptocurrency.\n\n\nStart Staking on Bitfinex\n\n5/ Mining and other early opportunities: Bounties, Rebates, Cashback…\n\nIn 2020, mining of the most popular proof-of-work coins (like Bitcoin) is a lost case unless you are in special circumstances.\n\nThese days, mining is only really profitable if you are a big player, if you have cheap electricity and special equipment.\n\nIf you have mining rigs and cooling stuff left over from when small scale Bitcoin mining still paid off, you can still make some money with that on the altcoin markets.\n\nThere are new proof-of-work cryptocurrencies getting launched all the time. With new coins you can get into mining early when it’s easy and pays well.\n\nHere on ATNET we alert you on these opportunities through our Crypto Airdrops page.\n\nBrowse Upcoming Airdrops\n",

      title: "Ichimoku Cloud for Crypto Trading",
      content: "Ichimoku Kinko Hyo is an indicator that looks complex to traders with 5 seconds attention spans.\n\nOnce you know what it does, it makes your crypto trading decisions way faster though.\n\nMastering Ichimoku Cloud trading really brings you one step closer to the actually realistic goal of crypto trading:\n\nMaking high-probability decisions without spending your whole day watching your TradingView charts.\n\nIchimoku Cloud Definition\n\n\n  Ichimoku Kinko Hyo translates as “one look equilibrium chart”. It was designed specifically to enable quicker and easier decision making when it comes to the strength of a market.\n\n\nIchimoku cloud is one of the default indicators available on TradingView even with the free plan.\n\nIf you want to learn about the more advanced TradingView scripts available on free plan, we are reviewing them here: Tradingview Script Spotlight\n\nIchimoku Cloud Lines Explained\n\nThe Senkou and The Kumo\n\n“Senkou span” is the name for the borders of the filled cloud, or “Kumo cloud”. The span is filled with green color in case the market is bullish. It will turn red in bearish markets, when the two spans swap.\n\nSenkou lines are major support/resistance areas - they attract the price. Traders set their entries, exits and stops around them - usually leveraging additional information from other indicators.\n\nThe TK lines and The TK Cross\n\nThe “TK lines”, or Tenken and Kinjun, are the balance lines - fast and slow moving averages.\n\nThey are moving averages, so traders will look for their cross when they are looking for a trend reversal. Because of their names, this cross is called “TK cross”.\n\nTK lines are also important when there is no cross in sight. If the price sticks around them, it signals that the asset is neither overbought nor oversold.\n\nIf the price action travels very far from the TK lines, it signifies the price is way out of balance and a pullback is likely, but it is by itself not a trigger to open a position for the pullback.\n\nIn more balanced markets the price stays around these lines and traders watch how it is bouncing off them or crossing them when they are looking for a good entry.\n\nThe Chinkou\n\nThe “Chinkou” span is a lagging indicator, use it to confirm a trend strength. Chinkou line above the candles means the market is strong. If the Chinkou crossed below candles, it’s a bearish turn:\n\n\n\nWhen there is a strong action and the lagging line crosses the candles it is a sign the trend is weakening and becoming undecided. Reversal is likely, but again, this by itself is not yet a trigger to short:\n\n\n\nHow to read Ichimoku Cloud\n\nBASICS: Ichimoku cloud Bullish signals\n\nFor a strong bullish signal, everything must occur above the Kumo cloud: The price action must remain above the Kumo cloud. The Chinkou line must stay above the kumo and Tenken should be crossing Kinjun also above the Kumo. Tenken should be crossing upside - if this cross occurs inside of the Kumo that’s still weakly bullish.\n\nBASICS: Ichimoku cloud Bearish signals\n\nIf you are looking for strong bearish signal, with Ichimoku cloud you can pretty much reverse all that has been said to bullish signals - price action occurs below Kumo, as well as Tenken and Kinjun crossing and the lagging line Chinkou. Basically the more happens below the stronger the bears are.\n\nBASICS: None of this?\n\nIf none of this is happening then it most likely means that at your timeframe the market is undecided, sideways, waiting for direction.\n\nMarket Structures suitable for Ichimoku Cloud\n\nIchimoku is mostly useful in trending markets.\n\nYou won’t get much information from Ichimoku Cloud in ranging markets. In market ranges, the cloud will be swapping between red and green very often, yielding very little actionable information. The same happens on short timeframes - and there are much better indicators and strategies if you want to be scalping crypto.\n\n\n  To trade market ranges, it is more sensible to use the Wyckoff analysis or any oscillating indicators, possibly also with regard to divergences.\n\n\nIchimoku Cloud strategies with other TA indicators\n\nThere is a number of trading strategies that involve Ichimoku. Involve - that’s right. Even in trending cryptocurrency markets, Ichimoku Cloud is rarely used alone. Typically, traders will use it combined with other indicators.\n\nTypically, these indicators will provide some way of identifying your support-resistance levels based on volume. It makes sense to use a volume-based indicator with Ichimoku because the cloud is only rendered from price action cycles and disregards volume completely.\n\nPopular Crypto Trading Indicators to use with Ichimoku\n\n\n  Volume, either plain or as volume-colored candles (links to TradingView)\n  Volume Profile or some other tool to determine support and resistance\n  StochRSI or other momentum oscillators\n  Fibs as an alternative way to find your most probable reversal areas\n  Bollinger Bands as a way to provide some range-like bounds even if the market is trending rather than ranging\n\n\nHere is a good explainer video of how to use Ichimoku cloud together with fractals and high-volume support and resistance levels:\n\n\n\nAdditional Ichimoku strategies are linked at the bottom of the article.\n\n\n\nIchimoku Cloud Crypto Settings\n\nLast but not least, the controversial bit:\n\nShould you use alternative settings for Ichimoku Cloud on cryptocurrency markets?\n\n\n  Ichimoku cloud uses past action of the market to predict most probable price direction in the near future.\n  The cloud is rendered from simplified past moving averages calculated from past highs and lows.\n  Because Ichimoku cloud takes the past action to predict the most likely future ranges and breaking points, traders want to reflect the past market action as precisely as possible.\n\n\n\n\nIchimoku works with timely moving averages, so on the crypto markets it follows reason to set meaningful timespans considering the fact that crypto trades 24/7/365.\n\nThe traditional Ichimoku cloud settings (9, 26, 52, 26):\n\n\n  9 represents a week and a half of trading\n  26 equals the number of trading days in a typical month (30 minus four Sundays)\n  52 equals two months of trading days\n\n\nThe idea of special Ichimoku cloud settings for cryptocurrencies is that the market is open 24/7 (20, 30, 120, 60):\n\n\n  7+3.5 = 10 (because of low volume on Sunday), or double for longer term trend capture\n  30 days in a month\n  2 trading months in crypto = 60 days\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Parameter\n      Value\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Conversion line period\n      20\n    \n    \n      Base line period\n      30\n    \n    \n      Lagging span 2 periods\n      120\n    \n    \n      Displacement\n      60\n    \n  \n\n\nSome traders reject this alternative Ichimoku cloud crypto settings.\n\nTheir reasoning is that the period lengths are meant to capture a time period, it doesn’t matter whether it falls into a week or not and changing the defaults is wrong. That is different from what StockCharts article about Ichimoku says and it seems a bit ignorant to disregard movements influenced by the day of the week.\n\nIt is true that if big enough traders start to use the default settings, it will become valuable to use what they are using.\n\nUnless you are prone to analysis-paralysis, it will not hurt to check both settings. Always backtest your indicator settings to see if it is sensible according to recent market behavior.\n\n\n\nIchimoku Cloud Traders and Tutorials\n\nBelow is a collection of the best that’s out there to read and watch when you’re looking to develop a Ichimoku cloud trading system for your cryptocurrency speculations.\n\nCarpeNoctom (crypto, basic Ichimoku trading strategies)\n\nCarpeNoctom made a basic video intro into Ichimoku Cloud that explains everything about the indicator pretty well. If you are new in trading, you should definitely watch it before you move onto the more fun but also more advanced stuff further down below.\n\n\n\n\n\nChaosTrader63 (Mostly legacy, but advanced Ichimoku trading strategies)\n\nThe legacy trader ChaosTrader63 has a YouTube channel and Twitter dedicated mainly to Ichimoku cloud. He mainly provides price commentary with new videos about once a week, and his trades are focused more on the long term. You will see him use the 1D chart a lot, explaining how he makes his decision. ChaosTrader63 uses the default Ichimoku settings - 9, 26, 52, 26 and is a proponent of this settings rather than of the “crypto” settings.\n\n\n\nChaosTrader63 is originally a forex trader so his analysis has more precision in it than what you typically get in the cryptocurrency space. He combines Ichimoku cloud with fractal trading and high-volume support and resistance levels (a simplified version of trading ranges method which can be traced back to Wyckoff).\n\nBelow his webinar on Ichimoku High Probability Trading where he explains how one can decide on an entry. If you have mastered the basics and are looking to learn some more in the way of craftsmanship, I highly recommend him.\n\nIn the video below his decision process consists of first looking at the cloud setup and waiting for a price/oscillator divergence which only establishes the direction of the potential position and a level for the entry. When that’s done one ought to look for a price signal (bounce, rejection, indecision) and finally entering the trade when a trigger appears (violation of the signal - so for instance a high volume move after a period of indecision).\n\n\n\n\n",

      title: "Shocking Facts About Cryptocurrency Heists [Infographics]",
      content: "If there is one question in the history of Bitcoin that cannot be answered with anything more than an estimate, it is the problem of how much of Bitcoin’s supply is actually ever available on the market. How much is locked up in wallets with lost keys, and how much is set to cool off for a few years because it was stolen?\n\nAs for the stolen crypto, the estimates are somewhat easier to make than for the cryptocoins that are “burned” and never to be moved again. According to Jameson Lopp, over 35% of Bitcoin’s supply has changed its owner in a heist - an estimate that draws from data on known cryptocurrency thefts and hacks.\n\nWith some alternative cryptocurrencies that are focused on anonymity more than the pseudonymous Bitcoin, the statistics get even more mind-blowing. According to one study, over 4% of Monero’s total supply is currently held by cybercriminals and hackers. At the price level on the day of publishing, that corresponds to over 37 million USD.\n\nIt’s no wonder that through 2018, cryptojacking became the most popular way to monetize cyber exploits. Cryptojacking, or illicit crypto mining, is done particularly easily for Monero and similar cryptocurrencies that have mining optimized for some form of ASIC-resistance. The original aim of that was to allow for wider community participation in mining by making it less profitable to use special single-purpose integrated circuits rather than your everyday ordinary laptop or phone.\n\nThe unintended but now prevailing effect is that cybercriminals can easily monetize access to any kind of infrastructure that has some spare disk space and memory - that’s practically any laptop or phone, but the juiciest plunder are the corporate ones as these usually have more available resources.\n\nWith cryptojacking, the owners or maintainers of the infected device typically have no idea there is a miner operating, and more sophisticated cryptojacking campaigns have developed various optimizations to stay under foot for as long as possible.\n\nThere are new ways of how malwares spread developed every day and the baseline of the cheap commodity malware you can buy for a couple of bucks is becoming more advanced every day.\n\nIt is safe to say that the malware industry has fully integrated the use of cryptocurrencies and is currently the most thriving cryptocurrency application.\n\n\n",

      content: "Palo Alto Networks’ Unit 42 reported a new malware that targets Mac users.\n\nThe malware was developed from code used for older campaigns and so it also goes for the obvious steady revenue generation through illicit mining.\n\nCryptojacking has solidified into good practice in the business of commercial malware, and so this particular one also taps into your laptop’s power to mining Monero. It also adds Koto, a lesser-known Japanese cryptocoin, that supports GPU mining.\n\nWhat it does\n\nCrypto mining is not dangerous, the real danger of this malware (dubbed CookieMiner) lies in its other areas of focus:\n\n\n  CookieMiner will steal browser cookies, particularly looking for data related to mainstream cryptocurrency exchanges and crypto web wallets.\n  It also steals saved passwords from Chrome browser.\n  If you have iTunes backups for your iPhone, it will also get your text messages.\n\n\nThis combination of credentials will probably allow the CookieMiner authors to get around multi-factor authentication on crypto exchanges and web wallets.\n\nThe malware comes with a script that gives the attacker remote control over your Mac and potentially can remain hidden for a good amount of time, patiently waiting until all necessary credentials are collected to exploit your exchange and wallet accounts.\n\nThe attacker could also leverage their remote access to later install a keylogger, while profiting from the crypto mining in the meantime.\n\nHow to protect your crypto\n\nThe report doesn’t mention in what kind of campaign this malware spreads.\n\nThere have been several major phishing mail blasts lately, some even very legitimate looking job offers with malicious documents in attachments.\n\nThe advice here is to be vigilant about what you click on in your e-mails. Similar level of attention should go to downloading new wallets and apps, perhaps for your airdrops.\n\nIt is always safer to have a triered device system for crypto, including a burner device that you use as a dumpster for every activity that is potentially dangerous.\n",

      title: "(2019) Michael Foster of LocalCryptos: Venezuela could be start of a bigger movement",
      content: "Note: Interview was edited after LocalCryptos rebranded into LocalCryptos.\n\nJust in case you didn’t figure it out, LocalCryptos is a peer-to-peer marketplace for big cryptos. This is a 2019 interview but we have reviewed LocalCryptos properly in this 2022 article.\n\nUnlike LocalBitcoins and most other OTC markets LocalCryptos is a dApp running on smart contract escrow and built-in encryption of all communication between the peers who are about to make a trade.\n\nAlso still unlike most popular cryptocurrency trading platforms, LocalCryptos is fully non-custodial. You get your own private key upon sign-up, there is no hot wallet to get hacked and no personal communication to leak. Proof of keys, proof of cash.\n\nThey are the technically most superior retail OTC platform we currently have in crypto but they are definitely not slumbering: For 2019 LocalCryptos plans to implement self-sovereign KYC as a way for traders to verify each other’s identity without trusting LocalCryptos with any personal information.\n\nLocalCryptos did all that with no ICO, no VC money and not even what would most people call a team: Just two co-founders coding and responding to customer support tickets.\n\nWe sat down with Michael Foster, one of the dApp’s co-founders, to chat about Ethereum P2P trading in the past year, challenges of the business and his opinions on blockchain and state.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The boom forced us to learn how to keep up, the bear market reminded us to stay frugal and remain strategic and careful.” (LocalCryptos Blog)\n\n\n\nAccording to the stats from dAppRadar, daily active users on LocalCryptos have been falling through 2018 but the daily traded volumes have been steadily increasing. That means the trade has been growing, even though the number of participants has decreased.\n\nIt looks very optimistic for a year of bear market, was it the result of a targeted marketing strategy?\n\nWe definitely had to get creative with our marketing.\n\nThese days you need to think outside the box when you want to advertise in the cryptocurrency space. You’re not allowed to advertise on mainstream platforms - not only Google but also Facebook, Twitter and even Reddit.\n\nAt first, we would place our ads on niche cryptocurrency websites, but the costs of this kind of advertising skyrocketed in early 2018. There was a lot of money in the blockchain industry still from the 2017 token sale boom.\n\nEssentially, we ended up competing for ad slots with projects that had hundreds millions of dollars in ICO money. Instead of trying to outbid them, we decided to focus on encouraging word of mouth.\n\nThat means stellar customer service?\n\nThat’s only one part of the problem. With a clunky platform you won’t create positive customer experiences no matter how excellent the customer service is.\n\nOur strategy is to design the platform as user-friendly as possible, and on top of that we are always there to help people if they get stuck.\n\nAs a co-founder, I probably talk to thirty-plus customers each day on Telegram, sometimes late at night.\n\nWe listen and we iterate; traders who have been around since the beginning will notice the platform looks very different today compared to when we launched.\n\nI think this proactive approach encouraged word of mouth a lot.\n\nPeople often underestimate how much a small team can achieve, even without overwhelming funding. But still, you launched in October 2017 right into the peak of the cryptocurrency bubble. How did you handle the first months after launch?\n\nThere was a lot that couldn’t be predicted. The market was a roller coaster as usual, and LocalCryptos’s volume generally follows the overall market.\n\nIn the early months of 2018, we had a huge influx of signups from a mainstream audience. Our platform had only just launched then, and we weren’t ready for the overwhelming demand.\n\nWe spent hours each day brainstorming ways to simplify the user interface, and to rephrase our user guides so that laymen would understand them.\n\nAt the time, LocalCryptos was only two people.\n\nCustomer support itself became just too much to handle. At the height of the 2018 boom, I would routinely wake up to one-hundred-plus new support tickets.\n\nEventually we had to hire some help for our customer support desk. There weren’t enough hours in the day for us to handle customer support on top of development and everything else.\n\nSo as your user base gradually changed in 2018 along with the changes on the market, did you also notice a geographical shift?\n\nWhen we launched, we had no expectations for the countries in top positions.\n\nIn terms of trade activity, Venezuela is our top country.\n\nIn terms of trading volumes, China and Russia are leading, but we have users in almost every country in the world. Other popular countries are the U.S., the U.K., Spain, New Zealand and India.\n\nIf you asked me in 2017, I wouldn’t have guessed that Venezuela would be our number one country. I might have said it would be in our top ten, but I wouldn’t have guessed it would be number one.\n\nMany people argue the notorious interest in cryptocurrencies in Venezuela doesn’t matter. It is not a rich country after all, the amount of money a Venezuelan can bring to the cryptocurrency markets is quite small.\n\nI don’t think the interest in crypto from Venezuela doesn’t matter. I think it could be the start of something bigger.\n\nSeeing the growing number of LocalCryptos users from there brought me back to why I found interest in Bitcoin in 2010: Cryptocurrency has the potential to rapidly accelerate economic freedom.\n\nFreedom is necessary for societies to progress - that’s a fact that many leaders sadly don’t understand, particularly in countries like Venezuela, Argentina, Iran and Cuba.\n\nIn my opinion, Venezuela is the most important country for developers and crypto-evangelists to focus on, and I think it could become a great example for the rest of the world once it is “flipped” to a blockchain-based economy.\n\nThat’s not an exaggeration, in my opinion the flip is totally possible.\n\nI’m excited about cryptocurrency lifting oppressed people out of depressed economies. If I can help by providing tools people use to prosper without the state, even better.\n\nOn LocalCryptos we’ve done a lot to accommodate the demand from Latin America. The website is now available in Spanish, we opened a new Spanish telegram group, and we hired community staff in Venezuela. I’ve been learning Spanish as well, but I’m not very good.\n\nIf the flip to blockchain-based economy were to happen, peer-to-peer marketplaces would probably play an important role in it - this type of activity can initiate changes in the bottom-up direction.\n\nQuite in general, what do you think are the biggest bottlenecks for people who are getting into P2P trading?\n\nThe biggest obstacle to P2P trading is getting your head around the whole process, especially if you’re coming from exchange trading.\n\nOne thing is your personal security and responsibility for your cryptocurrency holdings. Centralized exchanges hold your crypto for you at all times, but LocalCryptos is a non-custodial marketplace.\n\nSecond thing is trading without order books. Trading exchanges have bids and asks lined up in centralized order books and matched automatically with a matching algorithm.\nOn a P2P platform, users need to manually choose a person to trade with. That concept is very new and strange to some people.\n\nThen there are also the scammers. How do you deal with abuse of the platform?\n\nYeah, scammers can be tricky to deal with, but I think their presence is sometimes overstated.\n\nUser reputation is a really useful tool here. At the end of each trade, users are asked to rate each other. If a user’s feedback score is very low or if they get reported, they’ll be booted from the platform.\n\nMost types of scams can be prevented with better guides and education. Once you are aware of the scam, you know what to watch out for.\n\nFor example, the most common scam is to convince the seller to send ETH outside of escrow. The scammer will put their Ethereum address in a chat message and convince the other party to transfer ETH directly to them, before they vanish with the funds.\n\nWe’ve mostly solved this by having a loud warning message pop up whenever a user posts an Ethereum address via a chat message.\n\nAnother very common scam is for the buyer to send a fake transfer receipt and trick the seller into releasing the escrow early.\n\nWe’re now working on an improved user-interface that will clearly explain the escrow process to new users because it’s usually people brand new to cryptocurrency who are prey to scams like this. We’re also going to publish video guides later in the year.\n\nHow about more advanced abuse, like the free option scam?\n\nYou are referring to people using P2P markets as free options contracts especially during volatile times, which is a more complex maneuver.\n\nI don’t know if it can be technically called a scam because both parties receive what they agreed upon in the end, however it can be a problem.\n\nIt does lock up the seller’s funds in the escrow, so they are potentially losing money they could otherwise use in an actual trade.\n\nYeah. How this works is that a buyer will lock in a trade at some rate, and then stay silent for an hour or so. If the market moves up in that period, they’ll complete the trade because they can sell the ETH immediately for a profit; if the market moves down, they’ll cancel the trade.\n\nThis kind of behaviour is tricky to detect or prevent from our side, however it can definitely be improved with better guides and education.\n\nAs a trader, you can minimize the impact of this by limiting the trade size for users you have never traded with before.\n\nIn general, if you are a P2P trader, these risks should be reflected in your pricing rather than regulated by the platform.\n\nOne last question: What is in store for LocalCryptos in 2019?\n\nOne thing you can expect in 2019 is changes to the user-interface, and even the homepage will have a makeover.\n\nWe want to make P2P trading simple for everyone, whether you are learning about Ethereum for the first time ever, or you have been trading Bitcoin since 2012.\n\nWe have some more announcements coming in the first months of 2019. Unfortunately I can’t announce some things yet; it’s too early and I don’t want to spoil a good surprise.\n\nMore on LocalCryptos.com.\n",

      title: "Stats from 2018 - Readers like Melancholic 100x and Ledger Wallets",
      content: "It is the last day of 2018 when I’m writing this post, so let me wish all the best to you and to crypto in the year 2019.\n\nAnd because it’s the end of year I thought I might look at the stats of this blog for once (we’re very diligent and professional around here).\n\nI found a couple of funny things to share with you and then one bit that you might actually factor into your support and resistance line-drawing art next year. That is, in the case crypto wanted to start moving up north again.\n\n2018 Top Performers: BitMEX, Ledger Wallet and Airdrops\n\nHere’s the fun part of the stats that tells a lot about the readers of this blog:\n\n1/ People are far more curious about TensorCharts than about other charting app mentioner here, but in terms of actual registrations TradingView still wins heavily.\n\nWe’ll have to add some more guides for TensorCharts, the learning curve is obviously an issue.\n\n\n  TradingView FREE Scripts\n  TensorCharts Tutorials\n\n\n2/ For the readers of this blog, Trezor wallet is of absolutely zero interest other than occasionally checking back if they didn’t implement that Monero support after all.\n\nWhile globally, Trezor and Ledger are contenders with nearly the same traffic. Ledger has a better affiliate program so people are more vocal about it, and it’s also cheaper than Trezor.\n\nI personally find Trezor more user-friendly but hey ho.\n\n\n  ATNET keeps the Black Friday page updated all-year-round with current discount coupons for Ledger wallets\n\n\n3/ People go check out various exchanges but by far mostly sign up at BitMEX.\n\nYou guys are sick gamblers.\n\n\n  About BitMEX + referral code for 10% fee OFF\n\n\n4/ There is a good segment of readers who are only interested in airdrops and nothing else on this website.\n\nAll power to you, brothers and sisters.\n\n\n  All Upcoming Airdrops are also tweeted about @altcointrading_\n\n\nWhere to expect the salty breakeven sellers\n\nNow for the more substantial part.\n\nGoogle Trends shows nicely the organic search interest for Ledger Nano S, Trezor and Keepkey - each the strongest keyword for each brand by the amount of traffic it brings in. The trendlines are pretty much the same for the “buy” search phrases.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin hit its current ATH of just below 20k USD on December 18, 2017. The peak search interest for hardware wallets occurred between December 10, 2017 and January 6, 2018. For Ledger especially the peak was leaning to the later dates of the range, people were “buying the dip” of the top range.\n\nIf you pull BTCUSD price data from Yahoo Finance (relevant chunk of the CSV on Keybase), daily closes for the time span give you an average buying price of around 15.5k USD per Bitcoin.\n\nThat is when majority of the retail bought in, or so it seems, and so there will probably be quite some salty breakeven sellers between 15-16k like there were around twelve hundred.\n\nEven if a lot of the search interest didn’t lead to purchase of the wallet (or crypto), it is worth mentioning that according to SEMRush the traffic of trezor.io jumped from 4k a day to 25k visitors a day during December 2017 alone. Ledger.com gained a lot of traffic but the data is not as good because they were also slowly migrating from ledgerwallet.com to ledger.com.\n\nWhat is perhaps more interesting is that both trezor.io and ledger.com maintained the new higher level of traffic through all of 2018, at least according to SEMRush. Since November apparently both sites appear to be breaking upwards but that can be a Black Friday thing.\n\nNonetheless, studying organic search for wallets is losing meaning just like it happened with generic bitcoin or crypto queries: People already know the products, they won’t google them anymore.\n\nAccording to Alexa 80-90% of Trezor’s and Ledger’s traffic is referral or direct. People mostly come from places like MyEtherWallet, Youtube and blogs.\n\nDoesn’t look like very dead to me, folks.\n",

      title: "Follow the money: Who's banking on IOU stablecoins?",
      content: "While some of the marketing speak surrounding stablecoins revolves around creating a fully independent crypto ecosystem without the greedy banks, banks are the ones capitalizing here.\n\nAdopted from the Weekly Market Commentary from TradeBlock, October 15, 2018:\n\nCircle recently launched its own IOU stablecoin, USDC, backed by USD reserves. Circle has built out a separate entity, CENTRE, to act as a governance structure and networking entity that financial institutions opt into in order to mint new USDC stable coins. CENTRE is not the issuer of the stablecoin, the member institutions are.\n\nAccording to CENTRE white paper, these member institutions are then responsible for issuing the coins and are audited by CENTRE to make sure the reserve is there.\n\nThis process works in a similar way for all IOU stablecoins: Verified customer sends a cash deposit to a member of CENTRE, the member then mints the stablecoin equivalent and sends the amount to the customer.\n\nThe issuing member now holds the cash deposit, the customer holds the stablecoin.\n\nThe issuing member is a money business or a bank: In the case of CENTRE, the only issuer (for now) is Circle. In other IOU stablecoin solutions, as well as with USDC in the future, the deposit may go to a regular bank. Circle itself is actively looking to become a federally licensed bank in the US.\n\nBut unlike with a regular customer deposit, in this case the bank is not paying interest to the depositor.\n\nTradeBlock suggests that for USDC these banking institutions would hold the cash deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank: “As the FED raises interest rates (another rate hike is expected in 2018 and three rate hikes for 2019) these banking institutions could stand to benefit as greater interest is paid on these cash holdings.”\n\nIn other words, according to TradeBlock banks lucky enough to partner with an IOU stablecoin might stand to earn more money on customer deposits than they would if you simply held your fiat with them, because then they’d have to pay you interest.\n\nTether is in a vulnerable position\n\nThis fact suggests that banks would now want to compete for depositors. Decreasing trust in a vulnerable competing stablecoin solution is probably very good news everyone else in the same line of business.\n\nThe CENTRE whitepaper mentions the problems we have seen Tether have, albeit without naming any names. It simply states that they created a separate governance structure with independent stablecoin issuers to increase transparency and minimize adverse effects should issues arise (although it seems dubious to have a single, supposedly fungible token issued and backed by different independent institutions).\n\nTether seems to be too inter-related with Bitfinex to salvage any transparency for now: The executive members of both organizations are the same people, both companies are BVI entities, most information is tied up in non-disclosure agreements and on top of it, due to banking problems it appears that Bitfinex is now the actual issuer/de-issuer of Tether. Which is fine, if the USD reserve is there, but that is an information that is not to be publicly disclosed.\n\nIt cannot be said convincingly whether Tether is solvent or not but given the current situation it would be strange if nobody attempted to profit from this vulnerable position that Tether and Bitfinex are in.\n",

      title: "Script Spotlight: A/D Levels",
      content: "A/D Levels by ParCorn on TradingView\n\n\n\nThe A/D here stands for accumulation and distribution, but this particular indicator does not analyze trend at all.\n\nIt is simply looking for reversal candles on your timeframe. Once it finds a reversal candle, it draws a support line from its price level.\n\nFull script code\n\nThe Script Breakdown\n\nThe script defines parameters for the candle - the size of the candle body and candle wick.\n\nIt then runs through the chart and finds the instances of candles with “bullish wick” and “bearish wick” which is the short-term reversal signal.\n\nThe size of the wick and candle body is relative to the true range.\n\n\n  True Range of a day’s trading is the difference between the day’s high and low, extended with yesterday’s close if it lies outside today’s range.\n\n\nThere is also a second set of rules for 2-candle scissor reversal.\n\nBoth the 1-candle and 2-candle reversal is plotted the same way, as lines of accumulation and distribution starting from the reversal candle.\n\nLast feature of the script is it colors the bar if the price crosses and closes over support or resistance.\n\nDoes it work?\n\nThe author himself does not comment on the use of the script but the featured timeframe on the script page is 5M. He uses the A/D Levels together with volume profile, session range and volume-weighted average price.\n\nYou will see the changed candle color better if you remove candle border color in your chart settings on TradingView.\n\nIn my charts, yellow bars indicate break through support and white bars break through resistance.\n\nScalping: 5M Chart\n\nHere is the A/D Levels script on Bitfinex BTCUSD 5M as retrieved on Sep 29.\n\n\n\nI found that it printed ridiculous amounts of supports and resistances over ranges.\n\nAt the first sight it looks confusing but once you are able to look more at the bigger picture and less at the individual lines, it does say a lot about levels of resistance and support.\n\nYou can always make the required wick ratio higher though, so that the script does not detect every little wick. The default value is 0.55 (55% of TR).\n\nHigher Timeframes\n\n\n\nFor the 30M timeframe and made the criteria for acceptable wick ratio even higher.\n\nIt did made sense to me, even considering the repeated breaks through the support lines that quickly bounce back.\n\nIt is important to note though that the script only remembers the latest reversal candle in the time series. Above you see that in the action between 6350 and 6500 where the resistance stops dead in the air because there was another passing reversal candle found later. You will need to use some judgement when evaluating the chart.\n\nOn the 1D chart, it is quite useful when you keep the default settings (0.55, 0.25).\n\nIt does not print support on volatile days’ wicks because it compares with the true range. You can also see where support turns resistance:\n\n\n\nSummary\n\nA single candle does not provide enough information to really judge the market. For scalping, evaluating a candle close might often be a little late. Other than that it is easy to print candles on the short timeframe.\n\nI would recommend it as a source of helpful information about that’s going on at the market but I would not trade it as actual support/resistance lines.\n\nFor short-term positions, TensorCharts’ heatmap and trades counter is more precise than the A/D Levels, it does not make much sense to resort primarily to candle shapes.\n\nNonetheless, I am surprised the indicator actually provides quite a good information once you play with it for a few minutes.\n",

      title: "The grim side of Bakkt's potential consequences",
      content: "Last month, Bakkt was still firmly in the shadow of cryptocurrency ETF proposals. Come September everything changed and the current Bitcoin community agenda regarding Bakkt seems to be one hundred percent neon pristine positive.\n\nIt is always worth being careful about new projects, particularly ones with this overwhelmingly consistent response in a space like bitcoin markets and technology.\n\nThere should be some polarization in the community, it only shows there is development potential happening from bottom up.\n\nWithout disagreements, how can the blockchain space claim it is decentralized, and how different would the community be from a scripted TV debate or personalized Facebook agenda pushing?\n\nThe thirsty traders\n\nAs it appears now, the dire market conditions messed with the appetite for decentralized governance significantly.\n\nIn August 2018, freshmen cryptocurrency investors from late 2017 and early 2018 were getting exhausted by the prolonged downtrend in the fiat value of all cryptoassets.\n\nWhile there is always a lot of silent people doing their thing as the bitcoin OTC volume estimates suggest, the public community voice was clear: There was a bubble after all, the correction has been long and exhausting, we need some fundamental positive news to justify a turning point.\n\nIn other words, We need someone who actually has money to invest, unlike us at this point, to start buying. Perhaps the ETF will do that?\n\n\n  Fuck the ETF, sure it can help price but why isn’t the Bakkt Project by ICE (the guys who own the fkn New York Stock Exchange) being hyped? It’s way more bullish. Physically backed futures contracts. That means they must buy the actual BTC, not like the BS futures we have now that don’t require the underlying asset to trade. ICE will have to buy up a ton of BTC and store it. Increase in price and reduced circulating supply. Win-Win. / Reddit, August 2018\n\n\nThis is not the place for Satoshi visions and other memes, rather it is that the community response prompts a simple appeal to common sense:\n\n\n  Are you really participating in a capital market and relying with your decision making judgement on the conventional public opinions?\n  With this mindset, would you have ever bought a cryptocurrency at any point in time before the bulk of 2017’s gains became publicly acknowledged?\n\n\nWho criticizes Bakkt\n\nWith the majority of the community being stoked about potential relief from the bear market, there is not a lot of criticism based on ideology this time. When someone already brings up a point against Bakkt, it tends to be very factual.\n\nAnd there is every opportunity to do so, for anyone who is interested: Bakkt project has a landing page and a blog but as of end September 2018, the content of both is marketing speak exclusively. Facts or responses to questions are sparse and vague.\n\nAt this stage, even an airdrop that distributes for a mailing list sign up gets questioned harder.\n\nNot your keys, not your Bitcoin\n\n“An ETF is a multibillion-dollar ‘not-your-keys-not-your-Bitcoin’ vehicle. That is why I am against it,” Andreas Antonopoulos said to the Bitcoin ETF obsession - an argument that applies the same to the Bakkt’s cryptoasset custody offering.\n\nAccording to Antonopoulos, the implication of this big a market for “second-tier investors” is the power over consensus gained by actors who are not personally interested in the state of the network because they do not hold their own private keys.\n\nRecalling the 2017 Bitcoin Cash fork and many other Bitcoin forks that followed, the pivotal point for most of them was the decision of major cryptocurrency exchanges to either support or disregard the forked coin. With bigger institutional investors coming to the market, should the fork pattern repeat, they will be the majority.\n\nNick Szabo similarly argues at this point the legacy products “might cause more problems than it’s worth”, as quoted by Bitcoinist.\n\nThe correlation of price with Bitcoin network activity\n\nThe symbiont.io president and Wall Street veteran Caitlin Long was similarly concerned about how forks will be handled by Bakkt, a question that was raised but left without an answer from Bakkt.\n\nLong also criticized the fact that client collateral will not be held segregated for each client but in a single account (“commingled”) and that it will employ fractional reserve backing practices (“rehypothecation”).\n\n\n  Read full commentary in “What Will Bakkt Do For Crypto?” on CryptoIsComing\n\n\nWhile Bakkt futures will not offer explicit leverage, the two practices mentioned will effectively enable clients to trade with more Bitcoin than there is.\n\nThat weakens Bakkt’s contribution to price discovery and removes a degree of transparency from Bitcoin trading.\n\nAt the current state of Bitcoin markets, price action is still very much correlated with network activity and cryptocurrency exchange positions data, both of which are easily accessible in real time. Due to the hidden leverage, Bakkt trading could potentially cause events that will be divorced from metrics observable by the retail trader.\n\nThe fresh opportunity\n\nRight now though, it appears that the business of capital management needs cryptoassets one way or another.\n\nElon Musk recently tweeted that he is considering taking Tesla private at 420 USD. Whether it was meant seriously or not, it has drawn the attention to a bigger problem: Due to increasingly strict regulations, the number of publicly listed companies in the US has fallen steadily since 1997.\n\nIn fact, more companies have delisted than gone public in every year of the past 20 years except the single year of 2013.\n\nOne of the implications of this situation is the damaging effect it has on portfolio management. It simply becomes more difficult to build a diversified portfolio when you don’t have a diversity of stocks to choose from, to quote the US Global Investors report written by Frank Holmes on 10th August 2018.\n\nThe report identifies cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology as a potential opportunity for investors who look to diversify.\n\nThe long-enough timeline?\n\nIt seems all of the critics of Bakkt point to a single issue: While it is laudable to pioneer a crypto custody service and to set the compliance standard for others, Bakkt’s own biggest edge seems to be in creating a silo of information about a market that, given the public trading conditions in the US, may later become crucial.\n\nEven so, there are people who believe that ultimately Bakkt’s model will fail:\n\n“A regulated exchange with a custodian may be popular for a short period of time, but it’s not the future. The future will be the original idea of a peer-to-peer network,” says Abhishek Punia, a cryptocurrency analyst at Draper Associates, one of the VC firms that are most active in the blockchain technology industry.\n\nAfter all, silos are prone to conflicts of interest and the difference from legacy finance is rampant here: Nobody is a prisoner of the only available system; unless the Earth’s electricity gets completely shut down, anyone will always have a possibility to interact with blockchains in a non-custodial or even fully decentralized manner.\n\nIf the Bakkt hype is to be taken seriously though, no flight to decentralization is likely to happen before an impactful damaging incident.\n",

      title: "Script Spotlight: Automatic Divergences",
      content: "In this Script Spotlight:\n\n\n  PPO Divergence Alert - not ideal\n  Adaptive Divergence - better\n\n\n\n\nPPO Divergence Alerts (PPOD)\n\nFull script\n\nPPOD is a script that plots labels under or above candles where a divergence on PPO occurred.\n\nPPO or Price Oscillator is a technical indicator very similar to MACD. It is calculated the same way as MACD but it presents the final value as a percentage.\n\n\n  \n    MACD takes the difference in values between those two Moving Averages and an EMA of those Moving Averages, then plots that difference between the two lines as a histogram.\n  \n  \n    PPO does the same but it then calculates a percentage. This makes value comparisons simpler over longer durations of time.\n  \n\n\nThe PPOD script is this older PPO Divergence pine script only re-styled so that it will plot labels instead of a line indicator below the chart. If you can write pine scripts, this OG source can be rewritten for use with other oscillators too.\n\nParameters: (lookback period to look for divergences, PPO fast line, PPO slow line, PPO signal line, PPO smoothing)\n\nDoes it work?\n\n\n\nThis is the PPOD indicator on 1D chart of BTCUSD on Bitfinex using the default settings: (55,12,26,9,2).\n\nHere the strongest signals are the red and pink labels that signify a bearish and bullish divergence on that timeframe. The red and green arrows show where the PPO was overbought and oversold - it is an oscillator which means you can use similar patterns as you would with MACD or RSI.\n\nWe can see on 1D the PPOD caught the 20k top although only after two other bearish div alerts at range tops. It also registers the current bottom.\n\n\n\nOn 4H you can see it registers the recent 8400 top couple of candles after the fact, but then it prints another divergence on the bounce which ended up being a pivotal point. That’s not bad.\n\nIf you are a scalper, you will run into problems on short timeframes and on the 1W chart the overbought/oversold fits better than the actual divergences:\n\n\n\nIn both cases it is important to remember what divergences actually show: If a divergence happens, there is a mismatch between the price and the buy or sell momentum. That strengthens the potential for a reversal but it is not itself a trigger to trade on that reversal. Whether you find a divergence or not does depend a lot on your settings, and I don’t think the same settings will necessarily be suitable for all market conditions.\n\nNow specifically to shorter timeframes - If the volatility is high, there will always be divergences. They show the price is overshooting, nothing else. The only actionable information to take from that is “maybe I should become a market maker”, I think. It means nothing for trades that are meant to last longer than a couple of minutes.\n\nDivergences are not useless for scalpers and daytraders though. One good strategy is to start the day looking at 4H to see what will most likely be the dominant direction of the session. Some days it is better to primarily focus on quick longs, some days on quick shorts.\n\nIn the most basic way you could simply plot an MA to see whether the price is above or below it. Divergences can be used in a similar way for confirmation.\n\nRemoving the Lines Is NOT An Advantage\n\nThere is one problem I have with line indicators reduced to simple alerts though: You do not get to see whether your indicator settings are not complete rubbish.\n\nSay, you are a scalper and want to use PPO Divergence alerts on 5M chart. You will load the chart, find that the default settings don’t fit and you will start tweaking them.\n\nMaybe you will find that settings with very low smoothing and big difference between the fast and slow lines work best, and you decide to go with that. The alert script keeps printing the alerts just the same but you don’t know there is more noise than signal unless you plot the actual underlying line indicator with your settings.\n\nPlotting a single symbol works much better with events that do not have development. You can do it nicely with “rektlines”: Find singular events that will trigger most of the bots - something like an MA cross, an Ichimoku TK cross, MACD cross. Calculate 10% and 5% level against the position of the bot and you have a level where the bot positions on 10x and 20x leverage will get liquidated.\n\nIn this kind of case plotting a single symbol is completely fine but I would not use PPO Divergence alerts only without also using the line indicator.\n\n\n\nBetter Alternative: The Adaptive RSI Divergences\n\nFull script\n\n\n\nI can recommend using scripts that will paint the divergence along with the underlying indicator, though. Looking for divergences is a pain.\n\nYou can use the PPOD but I prefer this Adaptive Divergences script which plots the actual div lines.\n\nAlso, this particular script is an implementation of John Ehlers’ Adaptive RSI. The length value is not specified by user, it adopts according to the price development. The script looks for price cycles and bases the length values on them which gives less false signals. Do try this one.\n",

      title: "Andrew Gazdecki on The Future of DEX Trading",
      content: "Below you will find the original article with Andrew Gazdecki, then-CEO of Altcoin.IO exchange from 2018. The information about Altcoin.io here is now obsolete:\n\nAltcoin.IO was acquired by BnkToTheFuture in 2019.\n\nIf you are looking for a reliable non-custodial platform for spot trading, both crypto-fiat pairs as well as crypto-crypto via swaps, your 2020 platform to do that is called LocalCryptos.\n\nOriginal article follows.\n\n\n\n\nAltcoin.io is a DEX project powered by Plasma that was first announced earlier in 2018 and just completed their crowdfunding campaign through WeFunder, raising $950k USD from over 1100 investors.\n\nThe CEO and founder of Altcoin.io is Andrew Gazdecki kindly took the time to answer our questions about what’s new at Altcoin.io and the approach that makes this DEX project distinct from other cryptoasset trading platforms out there.\n\n\n\nThe atomic swap wallet at https://swap.altcoin.io:\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a recent blog post you announced the decision to open-source your atomic swap wallet. That is an unusual decision now that most blockchain tech projects are becoming protective of their assets, relying on private deals and so on. What was behind it?\n\nCommunity approach is one of the core values of Altcoin.io and there is a reason for it, so the decision to open-source the atomic swap wallet was mostly strategic.\n\nClearly the crypto community has amazing power and blockchain industry is full of talented people, but I also think the best path forward for blockchain advancements is through more open collaboration and less closed competition.\n\nThis is the case especially when it comes to decentralized trading. After all we are all working on the same mission to create more secure cryptocurrency trading environments.\n\nIs this a hint at the issue with getting initial liquidity that new cryptocurrency exchanges face?\n\nThat is one of the implications of closed competition. I believe the liquidity problem is partly self-inflicted because new trading platforms silo technology and customers to protect market share.\n\nQuite generally in the cryptotrading industry, it is our combined talent and effort that is the key to unlocking a market that will be decentralized also in the practical sense of the word - truly liquid, not just “located on a DEX”. If we work together we can leverage each other’s strengths to overcome the toughest challenges as a community, creating a better market for everyone.\n\nTo facilitate this we are developing an SDK for pooled liquidity among multiple decentralized exchanges and dApps because sharing the liquidity is simply one of the easiest ways to solve this problem.\n\n\n\n  Introducing the Altcoin.io Team\n\n  The CEO and founder is Andrew Gazdecki who was also the founder of Bizness Apps, the number #91 on Inc. Magazine’s list of the 500 fastest-growing companies in 2015. Andrew lives in San Diego and travels back and forth between California and Bosnia where the Altcoin.io engineering team is based.\n\n  Sule, or Sulejman Sarajlija, is the Altcoin.io CTO and lead developer. He specializes in back-end development and blockchain technologies. He leads Djenad, Anto, and Azra, who are the engineering team.\n\n  Fabian Vogelsteller is one of the six technical advisors to Altcoin.io. Fabian’s worked on many open-source projects in the blockchain space, including Ethereum’s Mist browser and the Ethereum Wallet. He also proposed the ERC20 standard, ushering in a new era of token trading, and brings a wealth of technical expertise and insight to the team.\n\n  Other than Fabian, the advisory board has crypto trading personalities such as Josh Olszewicz, Nick \"Pizpie\" Cote or Nate \"Coinrun\" Freire.\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAltcoin.io is not the first platform with plans to pool the liquidity, though. How are you going to appeal to other DEXes and dApps to work with you?\n\nFirst point is scalability. We first started out working with atomic swaps to address both trustless trading and blockchain interoperability and we had some success with that. But in the end atomic swaps fail to provide the great user experience we aim for - transactions take minutes to confirm and fees can get high.\n\nThe crypto trading community wants security but not at all costs, which is why we have completely moved away from atomic swap research and are building a Plasma-based DEX instead.\n\nApart from our focus on scalability, what makes Altcoin.io different is user experience. That is an often neglected aspect in decentralized trading.\n\nCurrently all decentralized exchanges suffer from unintuitive, slow, multi-step user experiences which leads to low user adoption and low daily trading volume. Especially newer traders are not going to trade on your platform if the learning curve is steep and the process of submitting an order complicated.\n\nIt is already starting to show - as Diar.co reported recently, all dApps have been losing their user base at a rapid rate. I believe user experience plays a role in that.\n\nThe goal of Altcoin.io is to be the first DEX that can truly compete with centralized exchanges and we know exactly what it takes as four of our six technical advisors are active cryptocurrency traders.\n\nSo we are very aware that in order to compete we need intuitive, user-friendly platform not only in terms of trading interface. Even the SDK we are launching is a complete out-of-the box solution. You can launch your own DEX without being a developer.\n\nAn onboarding path from fiat to crypto is surely part of the package to compete with centralized platforms. In August 2018, Altcoin.io partnered with SendWyre while DEXes are typically choosing to directly implement a stablecoin. Why SendWyre?\n\nThe main point here is to reduce friction for both new and experienced users.\n\nCrypto trading old-timers may be comfortable with scenarios like buying a cryptocurrency directly, storing it anonymously and hedging its value in some way to capture the market movements, but people who are new to cryptocurrency trading are interested in different kind of products.\n\nSendWyre is a regulated service that provides a fiat to crypto on-boarding path. They verify that you are who you say you are, mint an ERC-721 non-fungible token for you and after this one-time process you are free to start trading with compliant liquidity on a DEX.\n\nMakerDAO who is the creator of Dai stablecoin has partnered with SendWyre as well which means we will be working with both.\n\nWe are definitely not avoiding working with stablecoins, if it seemed like that. Partnering with SendWyre was just the most efficient way to open up our exchange to those who may be entering cryptocurrency for the very first time, which is huge.\n\nIn terms of potential collaboration with Altcoin.io, what other blockchain technology projects are you watching?\n\nNot exactly in terms of partnership opportunity but we’re huge fans of Tendermint and the Raiden Network.\n\nI think blockchain scalability is one of the most important issues to be working on right now. Without scalable solutions, mass user adoption will not happen no matter how good the blockchain applications get.\n",

      content: "The SANS Internet Storm Center published a report on 29th June 2018 analyzing a new malware that targets the cryptocurrency community. This time the malware targets MacOS, at this stage it is not very sophisticated but as affordable and easy to use as it is, a lot of people will surely try and improve on it.\n\nThis particular iteration is a heavy script that downloads a malware package from a cloud host. Victims get to download the installer themselves: The attacker posts a line of code into crypto communities on Slack and Discord from an account with username and avatar similar to the one of an admin or developer.\n\nSince most crypto projects have community beta testing chats, the impostor dev strategy should be reasonably successful even though for an outsider it probably looks quite lame and obvious. It also costs next to nothing, just like email phishing and social engineering, which means we should expect these attacks are here to stay and will only get more intricate with time.\n\nAccording to trendmicro.com this is also the overall prediction for year 2018 in cyber security: phishing has been a huge success, especially using fake sites and malicious PDF files, of course it will grow. It does not need a lot of technical skill to pull this off, targeted attacks can be sold as a service and even a child can afford that from their pocket money.\n\nThe particular type of malware is likely going to vary, even ancient OG malware schemes are now getting upgraded to check for cryptocurrency wallet files on the victim machine.\n\nStay safe out there…Couple years ago that would refer to “Do not get rekt by accidentally entering a trade against Okcoin whale”. We have come a long way.\n\n\n\nRelated post, as ever: Tiered Device Management for Crypto Holders\n",

      title: "Stealer Malware Targeting Cryptocurrency Owners Got Affordable",
      content: "The cybersecurity buzz from past weeks focused mostly on ransomware as far as cryptospace is concerned. Ransomware or repurposed ransomware that mines Monero are still the bulk of threats that are going around - but they also get most voice because it is the companies and servers that are concerned with this type of threat, not individuals.\n\nHowever, the industry develops and just as couple years ago the darknet markets made it easy and affordable to purchase trojans, spyware and DDOS services from groups with customer support better than most legit software vendors, information stealers are now also becoming widely accessible.\n\nNocturnal stealer is a product sold via an online forum for 25 USD. If you thought nobody would bother with small fish like you hence you don’t need to bother with security, think again.\n\nDemocratizing Malware\n\nThis particular product comes with a user backend on a server owned by the authors of Nocturnal. If you pay for access you will get a user account and a package with the stealer to distribute but the package is already configured so that to get your stolen data you do not need to know how to code or how to admin a server.\n\nThe authors claim the server is unlikely to get seized and if it does, it does not collect user IP addresses so it should not be dangerous to use this, if you want to take their word for it. It is most likely though they archive the data they get through their customers and will probably first use it and then resell it. Proofpoint reports Nocturnal uses some quite high profile detection avoidance techniques which is uncommon in cheap products, the fact the Nocturnal people are the owners of their customers’ data could explain that.\n\nThey also offer customer support, minimum duration one month. I have to admin it looks pretty good, actually.\n\nWhat Nocturnal Stealer Targets\n\nThe stealer will first save your external IP, country code and similar information that can identify you in web traffic. Then it will scan your browsers for stored data, cookies, credit card information and autofills. It also collects FTP credentials form Filezilla and last but not least, wallet files and access data identified as related to mainstream cryptocurrencies:\n\nBitcoin Core, Ethereum, ElectrumLTC, Monero, Electrum, Exodus, Dash, Litecoin, ElectronCash, ZCash, MultiDoge, AnonCoin, BBQCoin, DevCoin, DigitalCoin, FlorinCoin, Franko, FreiCoin, GoldCoin, InfiniteCoin, IOCoin, IxCoin, MegaCoin, MinCoin, NameCoin, PrimeCoin, TerraCoin, and YACoin.\n\nThe disadvantage of this software is there is no operator with admin access to the victim, it is just a script so it won’t be able to find information that is well obfuscated on your hard drive. However, we all know most people don’t bother.\n\nWhat you can do\n\nAs always, the best thing you can do is to make your crypto transactions from a computer you never use otherwise - thanks to the recent Drupal and other vulnerabilities malware is now spreading a lot through legitimate business websites where the company is cutting costs by not having fulltime webadmin staff and nobody knows it was necessary to apply a patch.\n\n\n  In 2018, you will not notice anything dodgy anymore.\n\n\nAnother part of the danger is the rising popularity of social engineering - you will not notice anything dodgy anymore in 2018.\n\nThere might be a normally looking software update prompt, you might also get an email with a PDF invoice. The idea is it will download the legitimate update or file or whatever it is and a trojan with it. The virus will collect some data, send it to a server and then delete itself to leave no trace. This type of attack solution makes 95% of all web attacks currently so it must be working quite well.\n\nIf you want to trust hardware wallets that’s a relatively reasonable way too, especially if you are transacting actively on the daily. Just remember they are a black-box, you don’t know what vulnerabilities they have.\n\n\n\nRelated post, as ever: Tiered Device Management for Crypto Holders\n",

      title: "The Stability of Stablecoins: NuBits all over again? ",
      content: "Let’s start with quick look at some data - PDF via docdroid here, plus the CSV source if you care.\n\n\n  \n\n\nHow stable are the commonly used stablecoins?\n\nI have pulled historical data from CoinMarketCap for the range of January 1 - May 29 2018, compared the daily closes and ran some basic Excel stats to see how well today’s pegged cryptocurrencies hold around their 1 USD value.\n\nThe results show clearly that the fully backed IOUs are still the most stable pegged tokens:\n\n\n  \n\n\nIOU’s Tether and TrueUSD are the most stable\n\nThey keep the peg well most of the time, the price doesn’t vary much and the lost value at minimum is less than 1.5%. It should be noted that TrueUSD is newer coin and only has available CMC data since March 2018.\n\nIn both Tether and TrueUSD there have been events where the price spiked in either direction before the market corrected back to the peg. In all cases, there was a fundamental event.\n\n\n  TrueUSD jumped up when Binance listed the token and the market was temporarily thrown off balance by the demand.\n  Tethers traded below the peg value when the Tether FUD was at its highest point and people were afraid the USDT tokens were not actually backed by USD.\n\n\nThat is the risk of holding IOUs: There will be a bank run if bad rumors start to spread about the company that holds the USD collateral, no matter what the truth is.\n\nConsequently, what we see now is fighting for IOU market share via high profile partnerships and auditing as clear as possible:\n\n\n  Both the TrueUSD lauch announcement and the recent Circle/Poloniex new stablecoin on Centre news release were emphasizing mainly the transparency and trust aspect.\n\n\nIt is not quite what cryptocurrencies were designed for, which matters not for ideological reasons but for the material point - if it happens that one day a FUD will actually prove to be the truth it might get ugly. For now though the numbers speak clearly.\n\n\n  \n\n\nDai has the third place\n\nDai by MakerDAO is not as stable as dollar-backed IOUs, the value lost at bottom during the past 5 months is 6.5% which is already tradable quite comfortably. You see from the chart the price spikes are fairly short-lived and swiftly traded back to around 1 USD.\n\nThe Dai is a collateralized stablecoin that anyone can generate by sending surplus of ETH to the contract, which creates some buffer for ETHUSD fluctuations. It has an intrinsic mechanism where people who had Dai generated this way can earn profit off helping return the peg, and also an emergency rescue mechanism if the peg starts failing hard.\n\nWhat are the risks here? While there are no regulatory dangers - the backing collateral is fully crypto - it is not hard to imagine that perhaps with a good vulnerability FUD people would run away until there wouldn’t be enough people to bother maintaining the peg. Another risk is too big a dump in the crypto collateral which would amount to a similar effect: The collateral buffer gets depleted, more drastic measures will be needed and eventually holders will lose value.\n\nWhat should be noted though is the coin remained reasonably stable during the first five months of 2018, when the price of the collateral (ETH) went from 1400 USD to 400 USD and back upwards. It is not apparent from the daily close values available from CoinMarketCap but when ETH slid off the ATH in mid January 2018 the Dai actually had several brief drops to as low as 0.8$ - here a screenshot from the blog of Preston Byrne.\n\nOn the daily chart these incidents don’t show at all, though - with stops in place, this could be a great market to write a bot for if that’s your jam. The concept of Dai does not rely on this primarily but it does help that Dai is traded on mainstream places like Bitfinex/Ethfinex.\n\nI will elaborate a bit more on holding the stablecoin further down in Conclusion, first let’s look into the obvious loser:\n\nWhat happened to NuBits\n\nNuBits is one of the oldest stablecoins. It has been around since 2014 and over the four years of its existence, the 1 USD peg has been broken several times. At the time of writing NuBits trade at 0.36 USD (May 2018), this time the peg has been gone since March 19th 2018.\n\nHow can this happen? To understand, something should first be said about the NuBits architecture and the cryptocurrency industry in general.\n\nThe cryptospace right now is at brink of more wide-spread use cases, which means more people are coming in with the purpose of earning return on investment. These people are not the same type of technological innovators as the crypto OGs. As a result, blockchain folks are starting to knock each other off and compete only in terms of marketing. While that is not by itself a problem, it might become a problem for the users if known vulnerabilities get replicated this way.\n\nWhy NuBits failed\n\n\n  \n    NuBits are digital tokens issued on the Nu Network which also issues shares (NuShares) so as to create a community of shareholders to govern the network and maintain the peg.\n  \n  \n    The peg is maintained through the laws of supply and demand in a centralized way - Nubits are either created or bought up by BTC reserves held on the Nu Network.\n  \n  \n    Once the reserves get depleted, the only good way to save the peg is to raise more funds through the sale of NuShares, which only works as long as there are buyers.\n  \n\n\nThis is where the peg ultimately failed again in March 2018. To put it simply, the Nu Network is not profitable enough to have the reserves for times of sustained attack, and March 2018 is not the first time it happened.\n\nFrom a Moneyness blog post from August 2016 - “End of a stablecoin”:\n\n\n  Back in September 2014 a developer going by the pseudonym JordanLee set out on a brave attempt at pegging a cryptocurrency, NuBits, to the U.S. dollar. The $1 peg lasted for around twenty months […]\n\n\n\n  In late May [2016], a single large seller of NuBits emerged, offloading around 10% of the entire NuBits supply in a day or two […] To keep the price of NuBits at $1, the NuBits team that was tasked with maintaining the peg had to use up a large quantity of its reserves. In the course of events the team decided to widen the peg to $0.95-$1.01 in order to slow the reserve bleed. However, the next round of selling broke the peg for good and the price quickly plummeted below 50 cents.\n\n\nThis scenario is possible in every stablecoin that relies on sales of a share token and has the owner as the lender of last resort. Other than NuBits it also makes Bitshares vulnerable, and some of the newly proposed stablecoins don’t really seem to implement anything more sophisticated than the reliance on issuance, share auction and trading activity.\n\nStablecoin Trends in 2018\n\nThis year the stablecoin trend is moving away from any form of backing to a system that mimics fiat currencies:\n\n\n  Seigniorage Shares - a system similar to the fiat banking proposed for crypto in 2015: Tokens are not backed by any asset or collateral. They are not IOUs nor collateralized, the stable value is maintained only by manipulating the supply and demand which is done via an algorithm.\n\n\nSeveral of the new stablecoin project that are being funded and developed in 2018 are inspired by seigniorage. These include Basis (formerly Basecoin), Fragments, Carbon and Kowala; they were not included in the peg comparison above because none of them are live yet.\n\nBasis, a stablecoin working with improved seigniorage shares system, even uses it as their marketing slogan - A stable cryptocurrency with an algorithmic central bank.\n\nDoes it sound foolish trying to pull off something central banks do while being far, far smaller and far less trusted than central banks? Shut up and take my money…\n\nSeigniorage Stablecoin Projects Overview\n\nCarbon / homepage - @carbon_money - whitepaper\n\n\n  Carbon works with the stablecoin and a Carbon Credit token. In times of sub-peg values, the system relies on selling the Credit token which burns the stablecoin. Credits can be sold at secondary market as well.\n  Ultimately the system will only work given enough market participation which is even said in the whitepaper very clearly.\n\n\nKowala / homepage - @KowalaTech - whitepaper\n\n\n  Mechanism of peg are rather weak: Trading activity, Variable Block Reward Algorithm (so that it doesn’t pay to create new tokens), Stability fee (transaction fee that is destroyed rather than sent to miners to reduce coin supply).\n  Would you still transact tokens if you knew you will burn your money by doing that? I would wait for the next guy to bite first.\n\n\nFragments / homepage - @fragmentsorg - whitepaper\n\n\n  Focuses on creating a spendable token on the ETH blockchain - a stablecoin that you will be able to use to pay for things in the real world.\n  Mechanisms of peg however rely on trading activity and on manipulating the supply/demand via a system of USD Fragment bonds and on the owner’s reserve backing.\n\n\nBasis / homepage - @basisprotocol - whitepaper\n\n\n  Basis relies on manipulating the supply/demand using not only share tokens but also bond tokens: Bonds are created when the value of the stablecoin falls below the peg and are sold off undervalued as bond that promises 1 Basis stablecoin in the future once creation of new stablecoins is necessary. This bond system helps to keep the peg if the value rises above it by generating stablecoins for the bond holders. Once bonds are depleted the networks starts using the Shares token - new stablecoins are generated for holders of the Share token.\n  The bond system also relies on people buying the bonds: If the trust in Basis is lost, it will fail no matter how cheap the bonds are sold. In the whitepaper from April 2018 this is commented with “a thorough robustness\nanalysis paper will be posted to our website in the coming days”.\n\n\nThe trend of spendable stablecoins\n\nThere is one more aspect and that is how are the stablecoins meant to be used. While the Fragments project, at least on the high level, doesn’t seem to have a particularly sophisticated pegging system, it is designed to be a spendable currency. To spend money on common day to day consumer goods, the coin does not need the tightest peg - that only becomes a problem once you intend to hold large amounts of the stablecoin to preserve the fiat value.\n\nAnother new stablecoin focusing on the spendability is Havven. Havven works on a similar idea as Dai (collateral backing on-chain), they just claim the token holders have better incentives to maintain the peg (links to whitepaper).\n\nWhat really stands out though is they are indeed making the backoffice part of using a stablecoin more user-friendly.\n\nIf you’ve only just looked up Havven and you’re scratching your head how this consistently bad a stablecoin can actually be partners with DEX giants like IDEX and Radar Relay: what you see on CoinMarketCap is their utility token.\n\nThe launch of the stablecoin is set to June 11th, 2018 but with what they already released Havven is making steps towards the spendability goals: since May, you can buy Apple products in the USA with their ETH-backed token that is already out.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhat is more important, the perfect peg or the usability? Depends on what position you are looking from.\n\nFuture-wise, the angle of spendability seen at Havven and Fragments may be good news for cryptocurrency adoption. Could stablecoin systems get used for real-life purchases? Theoretically yes, fiat currencies fluctuate a great deal too, it is a long shot though.\n\nHow about stablecoins for trading? That is I think the only real use case for now. If you want a good, liquid fiat market on a professional trading platform but you cannot KYC because you live somewhere other than US or EU, collateralized tokens might be the only way; likewise when you want to trade fiat markets on decentralized exchanges.\n\nFrom the trader’s point of view, the risk of broken peg is small enough for short term positions, plus the fact that the token trades on a high volume platform with market makers does contribute to the stability of the peg.\n\nDon’t ask me who is the fish here though.\n\nIn terms of value preservation, at this stage no matter which stablecoin you choose, there is no free lunch: you are always exposed to banking issues (IOUs), artificial devaluation (Dai, in an extreme case) or attack resulting in loss of trust (all of them).\n\nSimilarly, if you decide to hold a non-IOU stablecoin it will need to be a calculated and active process: you will need to participate on the maintenance of the peg. With the current size of crypto market a price-stable coin cannot be a risk-free way to park your fiat value for a year or so. I would simply not recommend using any stablecoin for passive value preservation, no matter how pretty the team’s website is and how cool the smart contract tech sounds.\n\nAll in all, if you are in cryptocurrencies uncomfortable with the volatility, best thing to do is really either to sell some to reach the level where you sleep well again, to diversify into a basket (there are now crypto index funds for that, too) or to learn how to hedge.\n",

      title: "Traceto.io CEO: We expect the nexus between KYC and credit risk in the blockchain industry",
      content: "Note: The project traceto.io has shut down.\n\nNot quite traditionally, today we are bringing you an interview with the CEO of traceto.io, a platform that promises KYC system for the blockchain industry that is on a par with the regulatory standard of the legacy finance sector.\n\nWe reached out to traceto.io because we know the developments in regulatory policies are an interesting topic for cryptocurrency traders but at the same time reading walls of dry text about policies will inevitably make a trader’s eyes glaze over, and the CEO of the platform Chionh Chye Kit kindly made the time for an interview.\n\nChionh Chye Kit and traceto.io\n\nChionh Chye Kit is the Founder and CEO of traceto.io, a decentralized KYC platform, and also the Co-founder &amp; Managing Director of Cynopsis Solutions, an AML software provider. He started his career at Pricewaterhouse and in total has gained nearly 20 years of financial and capital markets experience, largely from working in Macquarie Group and ING Bank.\n\nIn case this is the first time you read about Traceto:\n\n\n  A platform on the Ethereum blockchain for reusable KYC.\n  Users store their identity information in an encrypted, multisig-based way and get privately verified through the combination of AI technology and a community of carefully selected humans who work as verifiers.\n  Human verifiers must stake the network utility token (T2T) in order to be able to participate in the verification process, which creates the incentive for them to behave honestly - either they earn T2T or they lose their stake.\n  Companies that provide services for the end users, such as cryptocurrency trading platforms, may request access to KYC information about their customers. The customer has prerogative whether or not to grant his KYC information to the requesting platform.\n\n\nThe main competitors of traceto.io are Civic, uPort and Selfkey. If you care to make an informed opinion, the traceto.io whitepaper is well constructed, understandable and does cover the differences between traceto.io and its competitors.\n\nChionh Chye Kit:\n“The regulatory standards in the crypto-world will only become more stringent.”\n\nThe legal standards are often very unclear in an international industry that is as young as the blockchain sector, so let’s first consider the basics: With traceto.io, the personal data of the customer is stored within a dapp and available to crypto businesses only per qualified request. Is this a legally acceptable model for instance for cryptocurrency exchanges - something, that businesses could readily implement and use even these days?\n\nIt is true that the details of the particular law might differ from country to country but in general, cryptocurrency exchanges always have the obligation to perform due diligence so that they can combat money laundering and financing of terrorism.\n\nTypically, the rules in most countries allow for performance of due diligence by a third party intermediary and the requirement on record keeping does not dictate that the exchange must store customer data themselves.\n\nThe whitepaper mentions as one part of your competitive edge a client base of two hundred organizations through your parent organization, Cynopsis Solutions. Do some aspects of traceto.io come from your clients’ suggestions and direct feedback? What are the most pressing regulatory issues for businesses in the blockchain industry?\n\nOur typical business clients from the cryptocurrency space are entrepreneurial people who focus strongly on the technology side and are not familiar with AML and KYC regulations at all. They realize it is an important aspect of their business but at the same time it is a challenge for most of them.\n\nBut we actually have about six hundred clients through Cynopsis in total, it is about two hundred out of them that currently operate in the crypto and blockchain business. So in our full client base we also have many strategic clients. The need for a decentralized KYC platform drove us to form traceto.io after discussing the idea with some of them.\n\nWhat makes a KYC system on the blockchain necessary then? Would it not be enough to use a database, to encrypt all data before storing and to only have trusted employees deal with the critical business?\n\nA blockchain-based KYC network can achieve higher efficiency than any traditional KYC system. Mainly the role of the network nodes is essential because it is the nodes that validate the compliance tasks, not humans.\n\nToken staking, slashing and other reward mechanisms are performed by contracts instead of an arbitrary authority, which is what makes the platform so efficient. Humans will be present too as support agents during dispute resolutions, to monitor and report suspicious transaction or to complete other minor tasks. But primarily there are crypto-economic incentive mechanisms in place to facilitate node operators to drive these processes.\n\nOther than that, traceto.io also has the advantage of sovereignty over the data and censorship resistance.\n\nCensorship resistance is I’m afraid quite an abused buzzword in the cryptocurrency space. Does it really matter for today’s blockchain businesses?\n\nWhat I meant is that no business or individual should be denied access to a KYC solution.\n\nCurrently the market for KYC services is dominated by several big players. They are established but they use centralized solutions that are more expensive and less efficient, because they cannot be scaled as easily. So for cost reasons it can happen that certain companies or individuals are arbitrarily denied the possibility to set up a KYC system or to complete a KYC procedure, which is obviously a problem.\n\nIf businesses are denied access to KYC and AML systems, they are exposed to the risk of being non-compliant with the relevant regulations which can have very severe and expensive consequences.\n\nThat makes a good case perhaps for smaller businesses or for blockchain projects that are just starting up. How about blockchain companies that are already using a traditional KYC solution? How difficult and costly would it be to make the transition from traditional KYC methods to traceto.io?\n\nThis is rather a question of compliance. My experience in the banking sector shows very clearly that the remediation costs incurred by businesses that try to cut their expenses by sidestepping regulatory requirements can be extremely significant. Having the most complete compliance solution in place is simply always the better option. In this regard the blockchain industry is really no different from the banking sector.\n\nThis need for the most complete solution is what we are targeting. Traceto.io offers a KYC and AML utility platform, not just a data storage solution. On the surface level, what we develop is a four-part framework that involves the initial verification of identity and screening for criminal activity combined with continuous due diligence procedures that have to be carried out over time - such as transaction monitoring and verifying whether the monitored address stays in the ownership of the same person over time. Considering the likely future development of the blockchain sector this completeness is an important advantage.\n\nIs is expected that as the blockchain industry develops, even more complex KYC processes will be required?\n\nCurrently, the KYC standard in the cryptocurrency space is relatively quite low. For ICOs and exchanges the KYC processes usually only consist of matching a selfie to a passport. Some more compliant businesses may purchase an Anti Money Laundering screening solution - Cynopsis provides the Artemis software for AML - but it is not a requirement for all businesses.\n\nThe crypto-space KYC standard is generally missing many elements that are common in traditional industries.\n\nTransaction monitoring is one of them - the analysis and risk assessment of transactions by a business’s end user. With the exception of the largest businesses transaction monitoring is unheard of amongst crypto companies, even though it is not problematic to do on public blockchains. However, it is the regulatory standard in most developed industries, not just in financial services.\n\nWe expect that in the future the blockchain industry KYC standard will increase. It will only become more stringent and eventually converge with the current standard of mature industries.\n\nAre there also any practical examples of advantages for the individual customer of a business that uses a decentralized KYC network?\n\nIn our model, we actually entrust the storage of private keys to Personal Identifiable Information, or PII, to the users themselves via a multi-signature approach. To get particular data about a user, the business first has to request the information from the network and prove it is a request for legitimate purposes, such as regulatory enquiries. The request then needs to be granted by a quorum of community verifiers that have incentive to behave honestly.\n\nGenerally, reusable KYC minimizes the risks the customer needs to take with centralized solutions. These days users verify with their passport scans and selfies on each platform separately, some companies may also outsource KYC to third parties. Each of these companies has full access to the confidential data, which means there is a substantial exposure of the customer to the risk of data breach or abuse from rogue employees. Users really should not need to submit their documents to different exchanges or ICOs over and over again.\n\nUnder the traceto.io model users only submit their documents to one place, they never lose control over their data and because the platform is decentralized, there is no need to trust any company or their employees. The security aspect is also improved - the centralized nature of existing KYC solutions obviously presents a single point of failure which makes them more vulnerable to hacking.\n\nBut with your solution, while the platform protects the data of their users, it also can pair the identity of the person with their cryptocurrency address. This means the platform has information about the user’s ICO investments as well as general transaction activity. The whitepaper even names this kind of transaction monitoring as the basis to establish the user’s credit score. That is a lot of sensitive information - what are your policies for handling user privacy?\n\nUser transaction monitoring and analysis already is a key component of KYC and an important standard practice in traditional industries. We simply intend to provide this crucial aspect of KYC service to exchanges, wallets and other platform providers in the blockchain industry.\n\nThe credit assessment is a feature planned for a more distant phase in our roadmap as we get closer to the nexus between KYC and credit risk in the blockchain industry.\n\nWe will not share this information without first obtaining explicit permission from the user and the relevant business we work with.\n\n Nick Cowan’s interview with Chye Kit\n\nThis article was NOT sponsored.\n",

      title: "The 2018 Dangers of Telegram Messenger - Telegrab & Beyond",
      content: "In May 2018 new attacks on the desktop version of the Telegram messenger were reported. The reports weren’t specific regarding the targets but since Telegram is the most popular IM in the crypto community, it is certainly something to be aware of.\n\nThe sneaky problem here is the current campaign is focused on data gathering only. What it means is you have no way to notice anything wrong, even if your Telegram was compromised.\n\nExploit that is “just” collecting information\n\nThe reason this malicious campaign is not a big deal for security enthusiasts is that it does not do any sophisticated breaking through encryption layers: It is a malware that emerged in April 2018 but it focuses on the desktop version of the Telegram messenger which does not support end-to-end encryption. Just for the sake of full clarity, while Telegram is known as the encrypted instant messenger, it does not actually encrypt communication by default. Encrypted chats are an extra option in the smartphone Telegram versions but by default, the privacy is quite weak.\n\nThe data gathering malware was discovered by security researchers thanks to a YouTube tutorial that was posted presumably by the author. The malware collects cache and key files from Telegram, by restoring the cache file into another Telegram installation the victim user session remains open. The session then contains the victims contacts and full message history. This data is stored encrypted, but Talos Intelligence explains that is not much of an issue:\n\n\n  The keys used to encrypt the files on Telegram desktop data are store in the map* files, which are encrypted by the password of the user. Assuming that the attacker does not have the password for these files, it would not be hard for them to create a brute-force mechanism that could allow them to get into these files.\n\n\nAnd the last material point is that Telegram does not provide any specifications as to what exactly can ever be stored in the local cache. It is possible that cookies extracted this way could expose information from services such as Gmail or Yandex, in one instance there was extraction of Steam login data recorded. Crypto traders who trade while chatting on Telegram should be quite careful here.\n\nOther dangers of Telegram\n\nIn addition to impersonating scammers (not_giving_away_eth), crypto social networks also have malicious actors that are way less aggressive but no less successful, mainly thanks to the common hunger for exclusive or early information about an altcoin market.\n\nThe hidden danger here are PDF files, often hyped up and given away by random people in various trading groups. However, you can also receive those per email as free reports, analysis samples or invoices.\n\nPerhaps you thought PDF files were something like an image and not dangerous: On the contrary, they are a piece of code with various styling and display directives for the PDF software to interpret. The PDF reader then makes the code look like a neat graphics:\n\n\n\nIt is extremely easy to inject random code into this kind of file. Relevant vulnerability reports here would be this post from May 2018 on the Adobe Acrobat PDF Reader. It features several ways to manipulate memory through a piece of JavaScript code embedded in a malicious PDF file. The memory manipulation can lead to random code execution.\n\nAnother popular PDF app Foxit PDF Reader also has this type of vulnerability, reported in April 2018. In some cases, just viewing the PDF in the Foxit browser plugin can lead to the exploit - it is not even necessary to download the malicious file. That makes it even harder for any antivirus software to detect anything - which already is a challenge considering these exploits only need a simple Javascript snippet.\n\n\n  JavaScript snippets can be used to download and install other malware, key-loggers or trojan horses.\n  Javascript can also overwrite your copy-pasted crypto send address to make you unwittingly send your money to the attacker.\n  MyEtherWallet phishing packages also include key components written in JavaScript.\n\n\nBest ways to protect yourself\n\nThe truly best way is to have an extremely simple trading machine that will actually be really used just for trading - and we are really talking about scrubbed hard drive with a setup r/minimalism would drool over. The simpler the system, the easier the maintenance and the less exposure to vulnerabilities that have not been discovered yet, which sadly includes any kinds of packages even from trusted sources. You should absolutely have a dedicated beater computer or phone for any riskier activities that involve torrents, download sites or streaming services with aggressive and possibly infected ads - more in an older Security post.\n\nHardware wallets are helpful too, obviously - especially when it comes to the address-rewriting malware: hardware wallets let you check the target address on the HW display which makes it easier to notice any tampering. Using hardware wallets is not risk-free though, they have their own software and hardware vulnerabilities. Both Trezor and Ledger wallet had serious vulnerabilities discovered in the past: Trezor’s here from August 2017 and Ledger here from March 2018.\n\n  as always, just being extra cautious goes a long way too: Use Google 2FA everywhere and don’t reuse email addresses.\n\n\n\nRelated post, once again: Tiered Device Management for Crypto Holders\n",

      title: "2018 AKA The Year When Crypto-focused Malware Became The New Standard",
      content: "They say that it ain’t good if people don’t steal it - by this logic, crypto is in a massive fundamental bull run. While even in 2017 crypto malware was reported only rarely, in 2018 it is clear that cryptocurrency malware development became a legitimate career path, kind of like credit card cloning in Brazil.\n\nBest way to get your crypto stolen\n\nJust by the look at the buzz of the past weeks, it would be easy to say the biggest threat to your crypto wallets is related to email impostors online download sites:\n\n\n  Here an email attachment trojan that looks up Coinbase credentials and installs crypto miner: https://blog.malwarebytes.com/cybercrime/2018/02/state-malicious-cryptomining/\n  An example of a bunch of trojan in a bogus “hack app”: https://blog.malwarebytes.com/cybercrime/2018/02/bogus-hack-apps-hack-users-back-for-cryptocash/ - those are apps people install when they don’t want to pay for the real deal\n  And here a legitimate-looking Android app that hides a crypto trojan: https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/monero-mining-hiddenminer-android-malware-can-potentially-cause-device-failure/\n\n\nThe truth is though, the easiest way to get your crypto gone from your wallet is to have your main wallets installed on a computer that you use for browsing dodgy online places with a lot of ads, getting torrents and downloading new software.\n\nThis is not a new thing, we made a post about it, Andreas Antonopoulos also recommends some tiered device setup (and he was a computer scientist before he became crypto demigod). The crypto malware business seems to be growing though.\n\nBefore the 2017 bull run, people didn’t care\n\nNow, there is a big community of computer security professionals and enthusiasts who essentially work as hunters. They spend a lot of time analyzing attacks, luring malicious actors into honeypots and reporting everything on blogs and forums. It is a good system but it has a way to let the unknown unknowns pass through.\n\nSo while everyone raves about crypto-related malware booming in 2018, there is a chance it just wasn’t in the spotlight before.\n\nTwo years of undisturbed bitcoin collection\n\nIn March 2018 a report was published on the ESET’s blog on a malware that was hosted as trojan in multiple files on download.cnet.com - a software download portal with the Alexa rank of 163. The incident that got the attention of a researcher was an alarmed user from r/Monero seeking help after noticing a script that overwrites his copy-pasted crypto addresses.\n\nThe culprit was an infected Win32 Disk Imager from CNET that has been collecting cryptocurrencies since 2016 without interruption! In total, there are 4500 users who have downloaded this infected application and some more who downloaded infected CodeBlocks IDE and an infected Windows port for GCC by the same CNET user.\n\nThe apps were removed by CNET upon ESET’s notification, after two years of undisturbed activity.\n\nTrusted resources then?\n\nA more ethically plausible way for people to get their crypto is covert mining. In a recent post on securelist.com the author analyzes a whole bunch of Android apps that have a XMR miner hidden in them. Some of the apps will request administrator permissions so that they cannot be uninstalled and while they don’t steal crypto, some will just mine until your phone collapses.\n\nAnd then there’s the cherry on top: If you know your ways well you can hijack corporate resources. Here csoonline.com reports how the financial impact shoots up if a crypto miner in a datacenter goes undetected up to the point where the mining starts damaging the hardware.\n\nImagine all the sysadmin crushed souls who can now get corporate sponsorship. Sounds very Fight Club, right?\n\nThe bigger business is of course in external threats though. Kaspersky Lab expects that in 2018 targeting specific business will be where the cryptojacking business will go, reportedly old ransomware is being repurposed for mining and patch lags are leveraged to mine crypto on a company’s bill.\n\nWith corporate infrastructure hijacking already happening and knowing the detection of crypto-related malware is difficult, this is not a good time to rely solely on downloads from trusted resources either. Here is an example of a fileless miner that focuses on servers and goes undetected by all common antivirus/security vendors.\n\nThe best way to protect your crypto is 1) to always double check the address when you are sending crypto and 2) to have your wallets on devices that are as clean as possible. It is not a big inconvenience to have a burner phone or tablet.\n\nThere’s an opportunity, too\n\nHow to get rich if you’re an app developer?\n\n\n  Put together the quickest app you can, maybe something for downloading backgrounds or whatever.\n  Add a Monero mining script into it. Add a routine to check for overheating so that you can milk the phone longer.\n  Publish the app online.\n  ??\n  Profit\n\n\nOr, you can develop an app that detects crypto miners and crypto stealers. Stealers are literally couple lines of code, miners are a piece of JS calling home somewhere. They can easily pass undetected. Before the big corporations rearrange their management resources to develop and market a solution for this, there might be an opportunity for a small company to establish itself through this.\n\nYou gotta do it right though: There is a bunch of anti-miner extensions for Google Chrome that are developed by anonymous people under random gmail address and are known far less than adblockers, and then there’s the Brave browser which blocks crypto miners and has Youtube ads all over the place. That’s a missed opportunity for these small fishes, without gaining some form of audience they get eaten.\n\nSome vendors are now working on solutions based on detecting suspicious communication, but there’s still a lot to be done. Citing csoonline.com again,\n\n\n  Cryptojacking is in the early stages. If a company spots one type of attack, there are four or five others that will get by. “If there’s something that could potentially stop crypto miners, it would be something like a well-trained neural network,” Lopez-Penalver says.\n\n",

      title: "How media agencies profited from the 2018 Google and Twitter anti-crypto regulations",
      content: "It only looked like big digital business turned against crypto in 2018.\n\nTokenized Crypto-Economy\n\nIf there is one paradigm shift many marketers don’t doubt about, it’s the prediction that in the future, everything will be tokenized. We see number of interesting projects that could in theory exist without blockchain but given the barriers in sending money across borders, practically the system would not be possible. The question which blockchain is best for instant low-fee payments is still open but once the dust settles, the world will be left with utility tokens for tasks that were never considered for monetization before.\n\nPredictions are difficult, especially the ones regarding future, but it is undeniable there is a significant secondary industry being formed just now by business that are servicing blockchain organizations.\n\nToken Media Agencies Abound\n\nIf you try to google phrases like token launch marketing or ico marketing agency, you will get a lot of Adwords links at the top of the search result feed. Apparently, there is a lively market for service providers who are willing to work in the token economy.\n\n\n\nImage: ICO marketing has been booming along with cryptocurrencies as a whole.\n\nSo, does the storm of bans across the biggest social media platforms not affect the service business of crypto at all?\n\nFor the sakes of completeness, here are the two biggest ban deals:\n\nGoogle ICO Ban Statement: In the Adwords blog, Google announced they will change their financial product restriction come June 2018. Ads “including but not limited to initial coin offerings (ICO), cryptocurrency exchanges, cryptocurrency wallets, and cryptocurrency trading advice” will not be allowed to serve.\n\nMailchimp ICO Ban Statement: As per their acceptable use policy Mailchimp is just putting more scrutiny on content that gets a lot of complaints. However, their very first tweet announcing the change came across as a total ban crypto-related content. They later attempted to clarify that not all cryptocurrency content is bad, it is only bad if the publisher is promoting a cryptocurrency while sharing news is still allowed.\n\nThat earned some backlash from the community for abusing semantics as it was not explained how it will be decided what is news and what is promotion. In this article at Gizmodo author sarcastically notes it still is a huge drawback because “those writing about or hyping up products in the blockchain space are investors themselves”, but that is not the main issue here.\n\nThere is an old advertising wisdom explaining the best advertising does not look like advertising, creates natural word of mouth and is rooted in facts. And generally, there is the sentiment in the community that original content coming from small accounts will be scrutinized more than content published by established media houses, even though the latter ones are more likely to have a commercial deal.\n\nThat brings us to the answer to where the token economy is most likely headed right now: One segment of Google Adwords that is projected to become even more competitive than it already is is the one that promotes token marketing services.\n\n\n\nImage: One segment of keywords that is just now becoming highly competitive is the one that promotes marketing houses willing to promote token products.\n\nUpon closer inspection, while one comes across names like PromoteCrypto, great many of these marketing agencies are not native to crypto.\n\n\n\nImage: Screenshot of olshansky.org, a consultancy that started offering the ICO angle.\n\nApparently, VC and startup marketing houses have often started offering new angles to their service list - token launch marketing, ICO promotion, influencer marketing in the crypto space, direct ICO marketing. See for instance Foxtail Marketing - an established US-based digital marketing house that now also advertises ICOs, or 7markets - a Lithuanian media house that originally specialized in retail forex market coverage, or Belkin Marketing, the Olshansky consultancy and many more just from this list.\n\nOther generic service providers have recently rebranded too - web development agencies, social media and SEO clerks, PR professionals.\n\n\n\nImage: Screenshot of searched.io, a British full-stack digital agency that is now heavy on blockchain.\n\nLast but not least, there are semi-automated platform solutions for ICOs and airdrops such as tokenget. That is probably the most budget-friendly solution, and we all know that airdrops pretty much promote themselves.\n\nAll in all, with service offers of this variety, the token economy is set to prosper no matter what. There is no doubt anyone who is able to connect crypto organizations with influencers and media will have a very profitable year in 2018. Launching a token will become vastly more expensive due to that and therefore restricted to already established business people (even a successful crowdfunding campaign must stand out of the crowd these days), but it seems a new era is coming.\n\nConclusion\n\nThere is a fine line between sharing news and creating awareness about a product, and it is likely the token economy will become a tough business relying on the support of centralized legacy institutions rather than on the community. It seems that Bitcoin will eventually emerge as the only remaining decentralized blockchain but at least for the short run, the bulk of the most visible business development will be elsewhere.\n\nThere is of course another implication. Watching how big media houses are creating factions and fighting one another to get a bigger share of the crypto-related service market, it just does not look like something that would happen in a dying industry. There is always the chance that a number of experienced people are terribly wrong, but honestly, how likely that is?\n\nDisclosure: This article is not sponsored by anyone in any form.\n",

      title: "Twitter's 2018 Crypto Ban",
      content: "Twitter’s ban on crypto-related ads came into effect on Tuesday April the 3rd and saw the social blogging platform follow Google and Facebook’s lead in prohibiting most crypto-related media.\n\nWhile it’s unsurprising to see Twitter follow the example of other internet giants, it is somewhat unusual to see Twitter roll out such a comprehensive ban. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey seemed optimistic about crypto when he said he believed it would one day be the backing currency of the internet and the world. Something has apparently changed since then.\n\nReasons for the social media ban\n\nWhat reasons could there be for the crypto ads ban?\n\n  Twitter, Facebook, and Google have all given the same justification - the protection of customers from scammers. The real intent seems to be the protection of their reputations though.\n\nIt is reasonable since particularly for Facebook and Twitter are the top social media platforms and want to lead the industry’s standards. Social media have very vocal users, a platform’s reputation could be walloped if ads listed on their platforms delivered users into the hands of criminals.  \n\nBut this only explains a generic ban on all advertisements for ICOs. Why is Twitter still more than happy to allow ads for public companies then?\n\nTwitter itself has been a publicly traded company since its IPO in 2013.  To understand the motivation behind the widespread shunning of crypto media we need to look beyond the world of ICOs.\n\n  Lack of regulation  \n\nThe G20 summit last month failed to reach a consensus on how to regulate crypto and curb some of the problems that plague the crypto space. Though some nations and companies have tried to tackle these issues alone they have achieved varying degrees of success. That brings a lot of uncertainty into the industry.\n\nIn the wake of these developments we have seen a consensus of sorts from internet giants as they opt to steer clear.\n\n  Hacks\n\n  These bans extend to ads for crypto exchanges and wallets so perhaps recent high-profile hacks played a role in the harshness of the response. In the wake of the Coincheck hack in which over $500m was stolen from a hot wallet, more than a hundred customers filed class action lawsuit against the exchange.\n\nSelf-interest  \n\nGiants like Twitter, Google and Facebook won’t be ignoring the potential of the blockchain technology. To think otherwise is naïve.\n\nMark Zuckerberg has admitted that he is studying it and there are rumors that Google may be looking into issuing their own cryptocurrency.\n\nJudging from this, one emerging possibility is that all these social media giants are to some extent motivated by the need to keep ahead of any possible competition. \n\nAd bans aren’t necessarily bad  \n\nGenuine ICO offerings suffer from the bans against crypto ads as it closes an avenue through which they can garner interest in their products/services.\n\nHowever, it is unclear how and to what extent it affects them.  Cryptocurrencies have a way of selling themselves as various token communities spread hype on a variety of platforms.\n\nSome companies don’t even have ICOs, relying instead on the quality of their product to generate interest and others offer their tokens for free as part of a community Airdrop.\n\n  Banning crypto ads does make it difficult for the laziest of scammers to gain traction. It may be allowing the best or most widely supported coins to thrive, and future developments in the technology could give Twitter and its peers a reason to soften their outlook.\n\nThat is a thing of the future though. For now it remains unclear what the social media ad bans will mean for the space but time will surely tell.\n",

      title: "LeverJ Review: Non-custodial derivative trading",
      content: "LeverJ is a leveraged cryptocurrency derivatives trading platform.\n\nThe project is developed by people who were behind Coinpit, a fully trustless crypto futures exchange.\n\nLeverJ does not fit into the no-ICO projects collection as it completed an ICO in November 2017 and a short public awareness airdrop at the break of November and December 2017. The total amount of $LEV tokens sold publicly and privately was almost 156MM LEV.\n\nThe way tokens are incorporated into the LeverJ ERC20 DApp mechanism are the LEV token being a share in the LeverJ network, reflecting its monetary value, and if staked it produces FEE tokens that are used to pay for trades at LeverJ.\n\nThe LEV token trades on OKEx since late January 2018 and the value of the token sale at the time of publishing is over 16MM USD. However, the tokens were sold in the ratio of 1 ETH to 3000 LEV meaning that at the current fiat rates of ETH and LEV the ICO investors are being at a loss.\n\nThe LeverJ team holds a percentage of the tokens, big part of which will be used to provide liquidity and support the platform operations.\n\nSome of the people behind the LeverJ project are known old-timers from crypto voice chats and Slack groups - the CEO Bharath Rao, the community manager Alex Ward, the advisor Swapman. It is always good to see new products created directly by people from the community.\n\nNow for the product. What is LeverJ aiming for?\n\nHybrid of centralized and decentralized exchange\n\nDecentralized exchanges are not a new thing, there are several of them (EtherDelta for one). But as the team behind altcoin.io already pointed out, decentralized exchanges work but only in a slow and tedious way. Pulling off a more complex trading strategy is difficult when the platform doesn’t really work when you need it to work.\n\nWhile altcoin.io is working on a spot solution utilizing the atomic swaps, some degree of centralized control would make the operation more efficient as well. As a matter of fact, both altcoin.io and LeverJ decentralize the trading itself but around the app there is a team of people (market makers? economists? certainly engineers, designers and support staff).\n\nThis kind of solution is very plausible even in the light of the recent crypto trading regulatory news as the key point for both spot and leveraged trading is the storage of customer funds - cryptocurrency trading platforms must be non-custodial.\n\nLeverJ implements this for derivative trading on the Ethereum blockchain with smart contract that settles on-chain between the participants of each trade. The orderbook and matching engine are centralized and off-chain. This way the order processing speed will not depend on momentarily blockchain congestions. The only thing that will depend on that is the withdrawal of the funds from the order contract. That, again, can be done only by the owner of the cryptocurrency. The exchange does not have access to customer funds.\n\nLeverJ Home \nThe Roadmap \nRead the Whitepaper \n\nAddressing attacks\n\nUnlike with traditional exchanges such as Bitfinex and BitMEX, in the non-custodial model a simple heist is not possible because there is no hot wallet or cold storage to drain. From the whitepaper:\n\n\n  For heists to be possible, the possibility for one person to control all coins in custody must be possible. Segregated accounts that only enable the depositor to withdraw only their own balance eliminate this possibility, since the attacker would now need the keys of most users of the platform.\n\n\nThe only possibility of a heist is user-by-user: there could be a malicious user on the exchange and depending on the exact solution of interacting with the exchange, there could also be poor OPSEC on the part of a regular user. Several variants of the user-by-user attacks (skimming) are explored in the whitepaper.\n\nRecent news on LeverJ.\n\n\n  In March 2018 LeverJ announced partnership with market maker Smart Contract Japan\n  LeverJ is hiring on angel list\n\n\nOur News section features LeverJ in the light of recent regulatory news from the SEC and Japan.\n",

      title: "Thomas Lee on how millennials probably will make the cryptocurrency market",
      content: "Thomas Lee of Fundstrat had an interesting presentation at Upfront Summit 2018 that was published via Upfront Ventures’ Youtube channel couple of days ago. If you are not familiar with the name, he was lead equity researcher for JP Morgan before founding Fundstrat.\n\nIn his Upfront Summit presentation he takes a market approach to valuing Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies are presented as an asset that is mostly dismissed by legacy people but very much admired by the generation of millennials. Since millennials as a group are so clearly focused on cryptocurrencies and since there is so many of them, they should be able to move the markets just as previous generations did with stock markets, gold markets or with housing - at least the bigger of them.\n\nTrust, millenials and Wall street\n\n\n  \n\n\nDownload full presentation from Slideshare\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThomas Lee has been active in the cryptocurrency space for some time and is bullish on BTC and ETH in 2018, according to a report at CNBC in January 2018. Specifically he said 9-10k USD should be the lower end of the Bitcoin’s trading range for this year, and that he would be an aggressive buyer at those levels. He predicts ETH at 1900 USD in 2018. Interestingly he also added strategic rotation between cryptocurrencies should be a good trading strategy for this year.\n\nThis kind of ranging market where value flows between different cryptocurrencies is interesting for traders, unlike at the end of 2017 when everything just went up. 2018 is looking like this kind of chop so far indeed, with panic sometimes painting the same chart all over but otherwise diverse trading for BTC, LTC, ETH, XRP and XMR fiat pairs. It should pay off to follow some cryptocurrency correlation data: sifrdata has long term correlations over 90-365 days, cointrading.ninja has as low timespan as 7 days.\n",

The tags can be used to build reports with statistics - such as how much you trade on emotion vs with confidence in your trading setup.\n\n    For tax reporting, just export the log in CSV. You get all your profits in losses from all exchanges in a single file.\n\n    How to get CoinMarketMan Enterprise for FREE (worth 49.99 USD/mth)\n\n    \n\n    The fully automated trading journal is a paid feature and CoinMarketMan is not cheap.\n\n    But there is an easy way to get the top tier plan for free: Sign up at an exchange through CoinMarketMan’s shill links.\n\n    You have Deribit, Bybit or FTX to choose from. Once your API keys are in CoinMarketMan, your plan updates automatically to Enterprise and stays there forever.\n\n    There is no other requirement tied to the offer, such as minimum traded volume or the like. Just sign up and you’re done.\n\n    Go to CoinMarketMan\n\n  \n  \n    Shrimpy in Free Version\n\n    Shrimpy is a crypto trading bot platform that, in its free version, works as a portfolio tracking tool.\n\n    Shrimpy platform is designed for the automation of long-term investing strategies.It supports a range of time-tested portfolio management strategies such as rebalancing, dollar-cost averaging (DCA), and portfolio-wide stop-losses.\n\n    If you just want to monitor your stack’s fiat value manually, sign up for Shrimpy’s free plan and you’re good.\n  \n  \n    Coinloop (Blockfolio alternative for active traders)\n\n    Coinloop is a portfolio tracking app catered towards more active traders. In addition to the usual news feed and an event calendar it also features AI signals with optional alerts. It also tracks the CME and CBOE Bitcoin futures.\n\n    \n  \n  \n    Moonitor (Blockfolio alternative for desktop/iOS)\n\n    Moonitor is a desktop and iOS app developed by a Redditor u/kumakote.\n\n    It is continually improved and the design of the UI is much nicer than you’d expect in crypto.\n  \n  \n    Delta (Blockfolio alternative for crypto and legacy traders)\n\n    Delta is quite a popular app, even though less so in the crypto community. It is powered by eToro, so you won’t quite get the privacy features you might be used to from crypto space.\n\n    Delta is available from Android and iOS.\n  \n  \n    CoinStats (Desktop tracker for active crypto traders)\n\n    Coinstats looks quite like CoinMarketCap except it also reads your exchange’s API and tracks your portfolio balance. Coinstats report profit and loss as well, great for active traders.\n\n    The tracker is available for desktop.\n  \n  \n    Blockfolio (Hacked 2021)\n\n    The most popular app for portfolio tracking, which was hacked in February 2021. Blockfolio does not hold cryptocurrency, but the hack still exposed its users’ data to spammers and phishers.\n  \n\n\nCrypto Charting Apps\n\n\n\n\n  \n    CryptoWatch - Freemium\n\n    CryptoWatch is the most popular free crypto charting software.\n\n    The charts are available in a desktop app or through the website, no need to sign up for an account.\n\n    There is no pine script library of user-created tools, but if you are just looking for a selection of pre-made (good) technical indicators, cryptowatch is a fair option.\n\n    We’ve got a review of the 2021 CryptoWatch in the blog here.\n\n    Cryptowatch gets regular upgrades and maintenance as is a very solid charting tool. Some of the newly added features include:\n\n    \n      Trollbox at the side of the chart\n      Correlation matrix to analyse altcoin arbitrage opportunities\n      Trading directly from the chart via exchange API\n      (Paid) price alerts\n      (Paid) API and Google sheets price data on cryptos and derivatives\n    \n\n    CryptoWatch was acquired by Kraken Exchange in 2017. Since then you can access Kraken directly from there, but it’s not pushed at you too much.\n  \n  \n    TradingView - Freemium\n\n    \n\n    TradingView is the most popular paid crypto charting platform. (It’s actually freemium - you can stay on free plan forever.)\n\n    Tradingview is a charting platform and also a trading community. Thanks to the community contributions, it has accummulated massive amounts of technical analysis tools that are available for free in the public library. They are written in pine script and are fully customizable - the charting platform is super noob friendly too, though.\n\n    We review some of the best TradingView scripts that you can use with FREE account here. On the picture above a shining example - volume profile fix range (daily) available for free on TradingView. (Here’s how to find it.)\n\n    Even though you can always use TradingView for free, the paid TradingView PRO plan will let you use more scripts in a single chart. The upgrade is not ultra cheap, but it gets the invariable 60% discount during Black Friday week every year.\n\n    Sign up now for a free account and upgrade on the next Black Friday.\n  \n  \n    ExoCharts - Paid (Free trial)\n\n    \n\n    Exocharts is a crypto charting app catering primarily to volume traders on crypto derivative markets. Exocharts support derivative markets on BitMEX, Binance, ByBit, OKEx and FTX.\n\n    It is a paid tool that costs 28 EUR per month, but you will be able to get one live chart in a free trial to see if you like the tool.\n\n    Exocharts will give you a daily fixed volume profile chart as the default view. You won’t get any candles by default, and in free trial you won’t be able to switch to short time-frames for more granular data or candles anyway.\n  \n  \n    Coinigy - Freemium\n\n    Cryptowatch is now a full Coinigy alternative. The web version now lets you trade directly from the chart on any exchange. Since 2020 Cryptowatch even has a correlation matrix for alt coins.\n\n    Coinigy is a cloud-based crypto trading and charting tool packed with features for altcoin scalpers, arbers and trading bot developers.\n  \n\nCoinigy is also great for the true altcoin traders who want to be the market makers in new markets, who want to leverage arb opportunities and want to be able to trade a market as soon as it opens.\nIt is not only a charting engine but also an API interface you can use to trade from an exchange account without using the exchange's web interface. UI and charting is usually terrible at small exchanges, at the same time those are the ones that you need to use when you arb.\nCoinigy doesn't charge any additional fee for executing trades via the platform.\n\n\n  TensorCharts - Freemium\n\n\nTensorCharts are an advanced crypto charting platform with orderbook heatmap and split-colored candles. This charting app is for dedicated crypto traders who are not afraid to spend some time learning.\nUnique charting tools exclusive to TensorCharts:\n\norderbook heatmap\ncounters ratios\ncustom JS scripting\nprice action sound feature\n\n\nTensorCharts is one of the best tools for scalping crypto.\nIf you want to learn using TensorCharts, head over to our TensorCharts intro and to our collection of TensorCharts tutorials.\n\nThere is a very generous FREE tier on TensorCharts. Start with TensorCharts For Free and if you like it, upgrade on Black Friday.\n\nCrypto Volume Trackers\n\n\n  If you are looking for volume indicators instead, here’s Glossary on VPVR and where to get it for free.\n\n\n\n  \n    Alerts: CoinAlert\n\n    \n\n    CoinAlert is a freemium tool that sends out Telegram or email alerts for volume change over a threshold on your selected market.\n\n    Unless you want a global alert on any volume-gaining shitcoin, this is the handiest volume alert out there.\n  \n  \n    Alerts: Trade The Chain PAID\n\n    Trade The Chain is a paid tool that tracks sentiment, social media buzz and listings across the alt coin markets. It gives you global alerts, which is great for opportunistic alt traders as you don’t need to pick your watched markets first.\n\n    Trade The Chain of course tracks the more standard market metrics like traded volume, which is why it is here in this section.\n  \n  \n    Alerts: CryptoWatch Volume Alerts\n\n    \n\n    Cryptowatch alerting lets you set up alerts based on volume or volume change, too.\n\n    You already need to know which market to track though, and on which exchange. Cryptowatch won’t give you alerts on volume gainers.\n\n    (Unless you’re already using Cryptowatch, this is not a very convenient tool.)\n  \n  \n    By exchange: FTX Global volume monitor\n\n    FTX provides a live table that you can download as CSV. It tracks global traded volume of top exchanges.\n\n    The data collection is done by Alameda Research, FTX provides a whitepaper explaining the methodology. Only platforms with over $10M Adjusted Volume are shown.\n\n    In the FTX volume tracker, Adjusted Volume is the reported volume minus markets with fake volume. Most often, fake volume happens on zero fee or token rebate markets. But FTX volume monitor also excludes markets that print transactions that never appeared on the order books - usually by copying real transaction activity from some other exchange with a small time delay.\n\n    The traded volume is reported live, along with open interest and the estimated share of fake volume.\n  \n  \n    Volume gainers: CryptoVolHunter\n\n    CryptoVolHunter is a free tool that scans new alt coin markets and alerts you on traded volume change.\n\n    Volume change to filter out the top changes are 1h, 24h and 7d. The tool also listens for newly open markets on Binance and Bittrex.\n  \n  \n    Most alts: CoinMarketCap Adjusted Volume\n\n    The OG crypto traded volume tracker is and has always been CoinMarketCap. This is the tool that gives you data on most alt coins that exist.\n\n    Over the years, there have been some questions about their methods: Do they count fake volume? Is there data tweaked in someone’s favour?\n\n    CoinMarketCap, now owned by the behemoth Binance, took to providing systematic volume reporting to make it less biased.\n\n    For volume per crypto asset, the traded volume includes all traded volume reported by all exchanges on all pairs of that crypto. Pairs are excluded from the total volume have a double asterist (**). This is done for markets without trading fee where it is easy to fake volume.\n\n    For volume per exchange, CMC gives the Reported Volume, directly from the exchange API, and Adjusted Volume, which excludes markets with no fee and transaction mining.\n  \n  \n    History: Bitcoinity\n\n    For traded volume on BTC, the best data is on the Bitcoinity volume chart. It’s easy to read, doesn’t kill your RAM, doesn’t require login.\n\n    The volume on the chart is split between the biggest exchanges for each day, all small exchanges are put together as “Others”.\n\n    Historic data is available, starting from 2010.\n  \n\n\nCrypto Trading Bots\n\n\n  We have a 101 guide on how to start bot trading crypto. There are platforms that will let you automate strategies without any coding required. You can also automate a DCA strategy.

If nothing else, check at least that.\n\n    Get 25% Off Coinrule\n \nMore on how to start bot trading crypto\n\n    \n  \n  \n    Shrimpy Crypto Trading Bot (free/premium)\n\n    Shrimpy is an automated crypto trading bot designed for long-term investing strategies.\n\n    The platform supports a range of time-tested portfolio management strategies such as rebalancing, dollar-cost averaging (DCA), and portfolio-wide stop-losses.\n\n    You can set up a custom strategy or go for social trading and copy strategies from the top traders on the Shrimpy platform.\n\n    \n      Shrimpy requires Python coding but has a dev community on Telegram and a vast knowledge base\n      Supports DCA\n      Supports technical analysis strategies\n      Supports portfolio rebalancing\n      Supports social trading\n    \n\n    The FREE Shrimpy plan only includes portfolio tracking. PRO plans with strategy automation and trading bots start at $15/month.\n\n    Get Shrimpy FREE\n\n    \n  \n\n\nMarket Screener\n\n\n  Market screeners are full-stack tools for market analysis. Screeners report not only the price action of an asset, but also its news coverage and sometimes even public (but hard to find) information like insider trades that have to be filled with the SEC.\n\n\n\n  In crypto we are used to single-purpose niche tools but as legacy traders adopt crypto, the more resourceful legacy market screening tools do so as well.\n\n\n\n  \n    FinViz Crypto Screener - Code 313883367\n\n    \n\n    FinViz is the most complete free market screener for stock, forex and crypto. Crypto is the latest addition to this 10+ year old trading tool, and crypto market screening is a bit subpar there, sadly.\n\n    You won’t get as many features for crypto as you get for stocks on FinViz, such as the feed of institutional and insider transactions pulled directly from SEC forms. If you also trade legacy though, FinViz is hands down to richest free market data resource.\n\n    It pulls granular data from SEC fillings, it gives you all the news for each stock ticker, and it has basic TA alerts pre-programmed on the public website. These are really simple things like oversold/overbought, but they will still save you time.\n\n    FinViz Crypto is only good to get you a quick overview of the 15 top crypto markets and their relative performance of their USD markets. Once again, if you also trade forex and stocks, it’s gonna get you much more use though.\n\n    FinViz Free Market Screener\n  \n  \n    TradingView Crypto Market Screener\n\n    \n\n    TradingView provides a triplet of basic market screeners - stock screener, forex screener and crypto screener. These are all available in the free tier.\n\n    The information you get is much poorer than with FinViz screener above though. There is the basic chart, with an option to switch to the full-featured technical chart, then there are news but from a handful of sources only, and there is no insider trading or other hard to dig out data. The rest of the space in the screener chart are just community ideas.\n\n    TradingView Free Crypto Screener\n  \n\n\n\n\nMarket Timing Tools\n\n\n  \n    CCI30® Index\n\n    CCI30® is a market-cap weighted basket of top 30 cryptocurrencies. The index started tracking the top 30 coins in 2017, having added some past data. The oldest available data is from 1 Jan 2015.\n\n    The index excludes stablecoins, constituents are reviewed and adjusted automatically every first calendar day of each quarter.\n\n    Daily CSV data are available for free, realtime API for a fee.\n\n    How to use the index for market timing\n  \n  \n    Crypto20 Index (C20)\n\n    Crypto20 was the first ever crypto basket index that got tokenized. These days the Crypto20 exists as one of many index products by a Cayman Islands company called INVICTUS.\n\n    Crypto20 (C20 in its tokenized form) is a market-cap weighted basket of top 20 cryptos. The C20 fund rebalances from current market cap values on a weekly basis and caps each asset at 10%.\n\n    For market timing and other analytical purposes, its main advantage over CCI30 is that being tokenized, it can be directly traded on HitBTC, Uniswap and other Ethereum DEXes. That makes its real-time data readily available for free.\n\n    Its disadvantage is that it caps each constituent at 10%, which is out of tune with the distribution of the value on crypto markets.\n\n    How to use the index for market timing\n  \n  \n    Crypto Coin Comparison Aggregated Index (CCCAGG)\n\n    CryptoCompare created a price-weighted index of cryptocurrencies and made the data available from their API. Access to the API data is freemium - free accounts get capped at 250.000 lifetime request count.\n\n    The CCCAGG index uses volume-weighted methodology and was created for the purpose to show the best price estimation for crypto traders.\n\n    The index in its current version returns volume-weighted average price for a single coin of your choice, calculated from its markets on more than 250 exchanges.\n\n    CCCAGG is a great tool to get a price-weighted basket index of cryptocurrencies, which is really just an average price of the top X most expensive cryptos.\n\n    How to use the index for market timing\n  \n\n\nStaking Tools\n\n\n  We have a full 2021 guide into staking and what are your free and paid staking wallet options right now. Read here\n\n\n\n  \n    Exodus wallet for desktop - FREE\n\n    The Exodus crypto wallet supports staking directly from the wallet for Algorand, Cosmos, Cardano, Ontology, NEO, Tezos, and VeChain. Your coins are locked up for a pre-defined time period. The staking app provides information on how the reward is delivered and wtherther you need to claim it.\n\n    Staking in Exodus is available in desktop version only.\n\n    You will need to install the wallet and get the Exodus “Rewards” staking app from inside the desktop wallet.\n  \n  \n    Bitfinex Staking - No minimum deposit\n\n    Bitfinex exchange stakes your PoS coins automatically. Currently supported currencies on Bitfinex staking are Tron, EOS, Tezos, Cosmos, Algorand, Cardano, Polkadot, Ethereum 2.\n\n    All you need to do is deposit to the exchange wallet. The yields are lower, but there is a reason for that. More details in our article about staking wallets and services here.\n  \n  \n    AllNodes Staking Pools and Hosting - Revenue Percentage or Monthly Fee\n\n    AllNodes is the largest staking provider on the market. It is both a masternode and staking service, primarily catering towards larger holders. However, there are staking pools that have very low limits of holdings necessary to participate.\n\n    Allnodes integrate seamlessly with Ledger and Trezor hardware wallets. Whether you want to stake in a pool, run a validator or host a masternode, with AllNodes you can be up and running within minutes.\n\n    Staking pools usually take a cut of your yield. Masternode and validator setup incurs hosting costs per month.\n  \n\n\n\n\nLending, Savings account, Yields\n\n\n  In this section we are only reviewing lending on crypto exchanges, which at least does not give you the false sense of safety as crypto savings accounts do. You can still get good rates.\n\n\n\n  \n    CryptoStudio Lending and DCA Earnings Calculator\n\n    \n\n    CryptoStudio is an independent comparison hub that provides detailed earnings calculators for cryptocurrency holders who want to DCA or lend.\n\n    The calculators are very easy to use. You start with an initial investment amount and a timeframe, a DCA amount if any and (in case of lending) an expected annual interest rate.\n\n    The calculator suggests typical values for all of these, as well as for the expected price of your crypto at the end of your investment timeframe. That means you can still use it even if you just want to get an idea.\n\n    The result tells you how much you would earn on price appreciation of your initial investment alone versus with DCA and with compound interest payments.\n\n    Go to calculator\n  \n  \n    Bitfinex Lending Pro\n\n    \n\n    Bitfinex offers to all users, verified or no-KYC, the choice between two lending interfaces to manage their lending wallets.\n\n    The classic lending interface lets provide your money for margin funding by requesting a specific rate and time duration. (You can indeed also take funding there, and by that lock in a low rate while it’s cheap before you enter a margin trade.)\n\n    The new Lending PRO takes some of the manual work away. It will split the content of your lending wallet into chunks and offer them at best rate possible, but never at a rate lower than a minimum you set.\n\n    In the dynamic mode, lending PRO will even periodically take down your unmatched orders and adjust their rate down to improve the chances that they will get matched.\n\n    Overall the rates for USD are high in a stable manner (around 10% APY), for crypto the yields are lower and volatility higher. That volatility can get you a very nice income in situations where the market is overleveraged and everyone is opening new margin positions.\n\n    Speaking of overleveraged environments, of the main benefits of lending in closed environment like exchanges with low leverage is the super low risk of you not getting paid your interest. In low leverage markets where the money never leaves the platform, the risk of default is lower than on obscure platforms like BlockFi. These also lend out your money to traders (albeit institutional) but the conditions and policies are unknown as that trading happens on different platforms.\n\n    Signup at Bitfinex Strategy writeup on Lending\n  \n  \n    FTX Lending\n\n    \n\n    FTX is still much lesser known exchange, and one of the very few places where you can trade tokenized GME and other stocks. Lending of these tokens is available too, and as the market is small, the rates can shoot up quite a lot.\n\n    You will see though that even relatively big currencies like ETH and BNB can get pretty high rates.\n\n    How to lend your crypto on FTX.com:\n\n    \n      After you sign up, you will need to go into your account settings and enable margin trading.\n      With margin enabled, move on to the mergin lending page here\n      Filter out the highest rates by clicking at the column name: “Estimated next funding rate”\n      Select your crypto and click LEND\n    \n\n    Go to FTX lending More about FTX\n  \n\n\n\n\nCrypto Price Comparison tools\n\n\n  \n    Fiatom fiat-to-crypto exchange rate aggregator\n\n    \n\n    Fiatom is a non-custodial price comparison tool of fiat-to-crypto exchange rates.

This tool was formerly known as bitcointreasuries.org.\n\n    At the bottom of the data sheet you’ll get some well-researched background info on some of the companies listed. If you want to know what the deal is with Microstrategy, Tesla or the lower-profile but actually very significant holders, this is a good place to start.\n  \n  \n    Bitgur\n\n    Bitgur focuses on market cap and similar traditional performance indicators presented in the visual form of a heatmap.\n  \n\n\nBlockchain Network stats\n\n\n\n\n  There hasn’t been a lot of apps that track the network activity of cryptocurrencies, even though fundamental metrics such as transactions per day, fees, mempool size or transactions per block have correlation with the price of bitcoin. If you know a tool that monitors blockchain network stats, we want to hear about it.\n\n\n\n  \n    Hashrate vs Price from Bitinfocharts\n\n    Bitinfocharts have charts of hashrate compared with scaled price for most of the history of Bitcoin (since 2010).\n\n    The same data is available for Litecoin, ZCash, Dash and quite a few other Proof-of-Work cryptocurrencies, most of which do not seem to display any correlation though.\n\n    The same page has a menu below the chart where you can switch to other crypto fundamental metrics such as transaction counts, active addresses, mining profitability and more.\n  \n  \n    Binance Chain Network Stats\n\n    The basic Binance Smart Chain Network Utilization Chart shows the average gas used over the gas limit in percentage.\n\n    The rest of the network stats includes classic metrics like unique wallet addresses, daily transactions and daily active addresses.\n  \n  \n    Bitcoin Network Activity from Blockchain.com\n\n    Blockchain.com (formerly blockchain.info) has most of the conventional network activity metrics, including confirmation times and fees.\n\n    You cannot overlay the data with price, but you can export them into CSV.\n  \n  \n    Ethereum Network Activity from EtherScan.io\n\n    Etherscan offers the most looked for network metrics on ETH blockchain in a style similar to what blockchian.com does for BTC.\n\n    You get data on gas usage, transaction costs and split statistics about transactions done in ETH vs ERC20 tokens.\n  \n\n\nCrypto News aggregators\n\nMost crypto portfolio trackers will provide a news section. Bitfinex trading app also now offers this functionality. These usually only track the major publications though.\n\nIf you want to customize what you get or also see smaller blogs in your feed, there’s plenty of dedicated aggregators for that.\n\n\n  \n    CoinSpectator\n\n    \n\n    CoinSpectator is a news aggregator that sources hand-picked cryptocurrency blogs and blockchain news sites, all updated realtime.\n\n    You can choose whether to view blogs, news and press or all of it.\n\n    There is also a leaderboard of ICOs that you can filter out - current, upcoming, proven scams and more.\n\n    \n  \n  \n    CryptoPanic\n\n    CryptoPanic is a popular news aggregator that comes in a free and premium version.\n\n    The premium version lets you add your own RSS feeds or Twitter handles to track.\n\n    CryptoPanic comes as a time-based feed, sortable by categories such as Regulation or ICO News. Other than that, if you type a symbol like ETH into the search box, it will filter out news mentioning your coin. It will also plot a chart for you with data from coinmarketcap.\n\n    \n  \n  \n    CryptoFlash\n\n    CryptoFlash is a newer aggregator that gathers news mainly from various subreddits related to cryptocurrencies.\n\n    The app has better filtering by coin.\n  \n  \n    Bitfinex Pulse\n\n    The Bitfinex trading platform now has a pretty good option for news tracking.\n\n    Users can customize Twitter feeds and other news sources to follow right from the trading interface.\n  \n\n\nCrypto Events\n\n\n  \n    CoinMarketCal\n\n    CoinMarketCal is a calendar of crypto-related events.\n\n    Features not only conferences and meetups, but also coin listings on important crypto exchanges.\n\n    The website provides email alerts if you sign up (remember to use burner email).\n  \n\n\n\n",

      title: "Dai - Stablecoin alternative to Tether",
      content: "Dai is the first product of a distributed autonomous organization called MakerDAO. It is a decentralized stablecoin that runs entirely on Ethereum - more on that later. For now it is not widely known nor used but a system like this is a great addition to the crypto space as it advances in the way of removing a middle man.\n\nHow Dai works\n\nDai is a token pegged against USD, 1 Dai is 1 USD. Each Dai is backed by an asset on the Ethereum blockchain, the asset is held in a smart contract in a decentralized manner. Because the USD value of ETH fluctuates, it is necessary to deposit more ETH than the current USD value, otherwise the position might get liquidated at some point.\n\nAnyone can generate Dai by sending Ethereum tokens to a specific address that holds tokens used for collateral, the result is collateralized debt position within the Dai’s parent organization - the MakerDAO. Dai can also be purchased if you don’t hold any tokens that could be held as collateral. There is a stability fee (similar to interest) that is paid by the user who is generating Dai and is used to maintain the peg.\n\nThe contract ends when the user repays the loan and the stability fee and gains back the access to the collateral.\n\nThe Dai has a system in order to maintain the target price of 1 USD and another emergency system to be engaged in times of market instability - more in the whitepaper. The emergency system is based on supply and demand, when the Dai become too cheap the generation of new Dai gets more expensive. At the same time through the “interest rate” it starts paying better to hold Dai which creates more demand. When the Dai gets too expensive the system works in an analogous way.\n\nThere are several parameters in the collateral system that can be fine-tuned, that is done via a voting system within the MakerDAO. Holders of the MKR tokens can take part in the voting.\n\nPros of the Dai way\n\nThere is already a number of stablecoins out there - cryptocurrencies pegged to a fiat value. Typically stablecoins keep their peg in one way, that is by being a registered company and having the necessary amount of USD in a corporate bank account. That is reasonable only as long as the banking works without any problems: if the bank decides to freeze the account the tokens turn into an IOU. In other words, should some form of ban or even a fraud come, holders of the stablecoin might not get out whole and there is nothing to be done about it with this kind of system.\n\nDai is a token that proposes another way, one that takes some ideas from the principle behind crypto-backed p2p loans - a fiat value is backed by a crypto asset. Dai runs entirely on Ethereum so in this case, Dai is backed by ETH.\n\nFrom the user point of view, the difference is that with crypto-backed stablecoin the USD value is obtained basically as a loan and traders are more aware of the risk. With the classic model of IOU tokens many crypto traders tend to treat them as cash, not always aware of the risk they carry.\n\nFrom the technical point, one important advantage of the Dai system should be stressed: There is no link outside of the cryptocurrency system. That eliminates the problem of immutably recorded value that is a lie (such as, you can have a record that there is certain amount of cash or inventory in the physical world somewhere but there is no decentralized way to verify if that’s really the case).\n\nCons of the Dai way\n\nThe Dai launched in December 2017. With a new system like this, the possibility of security holes, hacks and attacks is always strong.\n\nThe Dai also makes use of some external actors: Global settlers, Oracles and Keepers. These participate in the market or provide market information. The MKR voters have to vote to select trusted Oracles, which is a weak point. The Dai system has built-in maximum sensitivity threshold to changes though, which should prevent attacks - sudden attacks at least.\n\nLast but not least, the system is clever but not average-joe-ready. The potential use cases sound great for someone who works in the crypto markets:\n\n\n  you can hold USD-equivalent collateral in a leveraged position or contract\n  you can bet a USD value on prediction markets\n  it can be used for remittances to send certain value no matter the crypto market condition\n  the blockchain is transparent which means controls and accounting can be easy\n\n\nConclusion\n\nAll things mentioned in the previous paragraph are advanced stuff, a beginner trader or investor is not going to go and use it. If however the crypto exchanges could make use of Dai (or another blockchain-based stablecoin) to provide USD pairs, that would be a much more seamless experience for everybody.\n\nAll in all, right now it seems that stablecoin systems will become a necessity, it is only a question which one will be the leader.\n\nGood resources about Dai:\n\nMedium.com/cryptolinks - Simplified guide to Maker and the Dai.\n\nPost from MakerDAO announcing Dai going live also explaning how Dai works.\n",

      title: "Weiss rating of cryptocurrencies is due today at 8AM UTC",
      content: "Updated in August 2021: For posterity, before you humble yourself before what might seem like an experienced legacy senpai, I invite you to read the now defunct Weiss Crypto Blog on the Wayback Machine to see some prime shitcoin shilling from times way before Dog Money and generally loads of being totally wrong.\n\nWeiss Ratings is the US leading independent rating agency of financial institutions. They are due to publish their letter grades rating of several cryptocurrencies on January 24 at 8 AM UTC.\n\nWeiss will rate not only the market leaders such as BTC or ETH but they will also analyze the altcoins that are the flavour of the month - potentially overhyped vaporware. In their announcement they mentioned cryptocoins such as Ripple, Cardano, Stellar, EOS, TRON or Bitcoin Gold but they also added many other cryptocurrencies will be included.\n\nTraders expect the ratings to be rather negative, in the best case scenario negative only for cryptocoins that are mainly valued based on promising tech backed by nothing more than a cute landing page. However, the headline on weissratings.com actually explains the grades are meant to identify the most promising cryptocurrencies which goes to show how one-sided marketing still runs the crypto show in 2018. Some traders are naturally expecting a fresh dose of turmoil in the currently choppy markets.\n\nThis post will be updated later with new information.\n\nUpdates\n\n\n  The free preview can be found here\n  Full report in PDF downloaded from wcy.weissratings.com/media (now defunct)\n\n\nBTC: C+ “fair but full blocks™”\n\nETH: B “good because readily upgradeable”\n\nNovacoin (D) and SaluS (D) are “weak”\n\nSTEEM B- “moderate strength in all key factors”\n\nWeek after the report, on January 31st, Weiss Ratings sent out a newsletter declaring overall victory:\n\n\n  Your timing for getting our  alerts couldn’t be better.\n\n\n\n  Last week, we caused global outrage with our C+ rating for Bitcoin. We were cursed, ridiculed and laughed at. One group even tried to mount a cyberattack against our Weiss Ratings website.\n\n\n\n  But yesterday, the price of Bitcoin plunged from $10,908 to $9,723. Nearly 11% in just 13 hours.\n\n\n\n  Crashes of 10% or more in a single day are not uncommon. They happen pretty frequently, actually. […] That’s why most bitcoin lovers are  long-term buy-and-hodlers. […] “Bah! We don’t care,” say Bitcoin veterans.\n\n\nNo word about how the rest of the market moved along with bitcoin. They could have added a note saying something like “this coin we gave a green rating to retraced as well but only this much, plus on the 1D timeframe it kept above the MA which could signify stronger market”. That would also support their sales objective while they would come off as a serious business. They opted for a simple exuberant exclamation though.\n\nBreaking Down Old News\n\nFor those who subscribed for the email notification from Weiss Ratings, there was an email quite late in the day when the report had already leaked. The subject read “Korean Cyberattack Fails to Foil Crypto-Ratings Release”. The email went to explain why the website was down for most of the day: a surge of visitors and an attack or two, the usuall stuff. At Weiss, they threw more money on the problem (“our staff instantly expanded its server capacity on the cloud many times over”) which is probably impressive in finance circles but rarely smart when it comes to system administration. In this case it apparently didn’t work either but everyone gave them a break once the PDF was found unprotected in a marketing folder somewhere (the link is now redirected as it probably should have been the whole time). So, were they even a bit aware what kind of thing they were getting into? Or did they expect that Reddit, 4chan and Kakao will each delegate a single representative to take care of the news distribution while the rest of the crowd will obediently refrain from F5-ing weissratings.com? This is the internet, people. Look down from your ivory tower.\n\nNow for the ratings. The best ratings (B - “good”) were given to smart-contract platforms made to host apps: ADA, EOS, ETH, NEO, STEEM. As for Bitcoin, they criticized that it has “no immediate mechanism for promptly upgrading its software code”. Given that all public cryptocurrencies use the same mechanism for upgrades of the code (it is called Github), do they really mean that Bitcoin is not a value investment because there is not a CEO in charge? I thought this would be a bit off base.\n\nEither way, something should be said about the system of the ratings before the internet forgets: The report is supposed to only touch the fundamentals, it is meant as rating of the current investment opportunity. For those who purchase the full paper, the ratings will be updated regularly. Maybe that sounds familiar already? Some figures: out of the 74 cryptocurrencies rated by Weiss these are the coins that have 30-day change at or over 25% - ADA, XCP, ETN, EOS, ETH, NLG, IOC, NEBL, NEO, NXS, QRK, XRB, XRP, SKY, SMART, STEEM, XLM. Out of those, Ripple and Stellar are the only two coins that have over a billion USD market cap and didn’t get a green grade.\n\nCoin / Mkt Cap [B USD]\n* ADA 16\nXCP 0.14\nETN 0.73\n* EOS 9\n* ETH 103\nNLG 0.10\nIOC 0.08\nNEBL 0.27\n* NEO 9\nNXS 0.33\nQRK 0.01\nXRB 1.7\nXRP 51\nSKY 0.21\nSMART 0.44\n* STEEM 1.6\nXLM 10.5\n\n\n\nSo, they are giving us the coins that are already hyped up on a market that is not super-thin. Essentially, this kind of rating is a polished equivalent of your social media altcoin picks group, with each green square being a toned-down version of statements like “TRX abt mewn, get in now for the pamp!!!”, in other words information freely obtainable from every trollbox.\n\nIs that wrong? Well I thought this whole event was a good comedy but not wrong really. The profits that every random South Korean highschool kid made on cryptocurrencies must be hard to ignore for the legacy folks, and if there is more of them focusing on Mastering Shitcoins™ while disregarding the “money-like” cryptocurrencies such as LTC or XMR, maybe we will finally see some decoupling of the charts.\n",

Which currencies are mooning or dumping the most this day? What exchange is getting trading volume increase? Which coins are more volatile?\n\nEach field on the heatmap contains the value of the metric, such as price change for the day on a green or red background. The field size represents either market cap or volume, depends on what the heatmap is tracking.\n\nBitgur has heatmaps of six different metrics: Not only price change of coins per time period but also neat stuff like unusual volume spikes. That comes handy especially if you are trading small-cap altcoins, and AFAIK not available from elsewhere.\n\nBitgur heatmaps live on bitgur.com/map.\n",

      title: "EOS - The blockchain that means the business",
      content: "\n  EOS is one of the most anticipated tokens in 2018. EOS is already being traded but only as an ETH token. All the ETH tokens will be frozen in summer 2018 when EOS will get its own blockchain.\n\n\nEOS Trading\n\nEOS was getting hyped up at the time of writing this article since there is supposed to be a major announcement from the devs on Sunday January 14th 2018. The actual news was a Bithumb person joining the team and an airdrop partnership which had impact on the price. In February 2018 Bitfinex announced they will be adding a new altcoin trading platform EOSfinex - addition to Bitfinex (fiat/tether) and Ethfinex (ETH tokens, decentralized). That was certainly bigger news but it didn’t move the price much.\n\nEOS spot trading\n\nCurrently you can buy or trade EOS on Bitfinex. If you are American and Bitfinex is inaccessible to you, EOS also trades on Binance. Both Binance and Bitfinex have re-opened signups, in case you don’t have an account yet. However, as per terms written on EOS.io both US and Chinese residents are not permitted to buy EOS.\n\nEOS futures trading\n\nThere is an EOSBTC futures market on OKEx.\n\nWhat is EOS\n\nEOS claims to be the infrastructure for dapps (decentralized applications). We’ve heard that before with Ethereum, but EOS seems to be the project that is learning from Ethereum’s mistakes. The people in charge at least claim something to that effect in one of their introductory videos: The CTO of EOS worked on Steemit and BitShares before and explains was a good prerequisite for being able to consider what more generic features a blockchain business project needs.\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe idea of EOS is to build an architecture similar to operating system that will provide the basic components for a decentralized business - data storage, user accounts, scalable communication system. Block.one, the company working on EOS, identified the bottlenecks of both bitcoin and ethereum as difficult to maintain dev-unfriendly code and high transaction fees. Both the high barrier to app development and high fees can work for a blockchain where transactions ought to be rare but it is not possible to have a real business on a blockchain with such properties, especially if what is called “transaction” is in fact the means of communication that needs to be instant and usable at scale.\n\nEOS blockchain comes with a built-in scalability solution, the ledger already counts with some load, the need for cheap transactions and also acknowledges that problems might happen: dapps running on EOS will have a “freeze” option which should stop an attack without the necessity of forks and rollbacks.\n\nCiting the technical whitepaper here, provided by block.one:\n\nThe consensus algo is called delegated proof-of-stake (DPOS):\n\n\n  Token holders may select block producers via a voting mechanism.\n  Blocks are produced in rounds of 21. At the start of each pack of 21 blocks the producers are chosen. The first 20 producers are selected by total approval. The last remaining producer is chosen proportionally to their number of votes relative to other producers. The selected producers are shuffled pseudorandomly to make for fairer distribution.\n  New block comes every 3 seconds. Producers that fail to deliver repeatedly get kicked out.\n\n\nBecause of the nature of DPOS forks should be rare - the block producers cooperate rather than compete - nonetheless, the whitepaper includes a proposed scenario for potential forks:\n\n\n  In the event there is a fork, consensus will automatically switch to the longest chain. This metric works because the rate at which blocks are added to a blockchain chain fork is directly correlated to the percentage of block producers that share the same consensus. In other words, a blockchain fork with more producers on it will grow in length faster than one with fewer producers. Furthermore, no block producer should be producing blocks on two forks at the same time. If a block producer is caught doing this then such block producer will likely be voted out. Cryptographic evidence of such double-production may also be used to automatically remove abusers.\n\n\nThis all is a proposed solution for the EOS blockchain that is not out yet. The token that you might trade on Bitfinex of Binance is an “EOS Token” that will be exchanged for tokens from EOS blockchain once it launches. EOS is (at the moment) an ERC20 token and can be stored in an Ethereum address.\n\nEOS Scaling Solution\n\nPeople naturally converge to comparing EOS and Ethereum, and there are also some skeptics with regard to BitShares - a much older cryptocurrency that also claims thousands of transactions per second. There have been voices about EOS being just BitShares with smart contracts and parallelization, and whether that actually makes sense.\n\nIt seems though that this competition with ETH might be a time game: scaling solutions for ETH are promising but still far away, and as for now, ETH blockchain does have scaling problems. With a completely new blockchain that doesn’t have dapps or exchanges relying on it working yet, it should be much easier to develop something that scales and effectively hijack the demand for a scalable blockchain. It is almost funny considering the preliminary token that is traded now runs on Ethereum.\n\nFrom Reddit:\n\n\n  EOS should be able to do 10,000 transactions per second per CPU core. If the block producers have one CPU that has 8 cores that’s 80,000 transactions per second. Now imagine if they had 10 CPUs. Eos can handle more transactions the better hardware the block producers have, this is not really the case with ethereum. Eos should be able to do a million transactions per second once it supports multithreaded transactions.\n\n\n\n  If that’s not enough, something like the Raiden network could always be built on top of eos which would multiply the amount of transactions it could support. The Raiden network can work on any blockchain. Eos simply has a better foundation for future scalability.\n\n\nPeople involved: block.one CEO Brendan Blumer; CTO Daniel Larimer; and Partner, Brock Pierce.\n\nRoadmap: github.com/EOSIO\n\nI wouldn’t be so quick to call 2018 the year of Ethereum.\n\nImportant - What to do if you bought EOS on an exchange\n\nEOS will get a blockchain snapshot later this year - exact date is yet to be announced but it should be before June 1st, 2018. It won’t be a regular event like with the IOTA tangle. The reason is, right now EOS runs on Ethereum but after the snapshot it will be getting its own blockchain, and you need to register the address that holds your EOS ERC20 for it to be included in the snapshot. If you fail to do that you won’t get your EOS blockchain tokens after the snapshot.\n\nGuide from r/EOS:\n\n\n  Go to the EOS website https://eos.io\n  Scroll down and select “GET EOS”\n  Tick all the required boxes and click “continue”\n  Scroll down and click “register”\n  Then select Metamask or MyEtherWallet (other ETH wallets are not compatible)\n  Follow the guide to register your address\n  Join the EOS mailing list at https://eos.io/#subscribe to get announcements about the snapshot.\n\n\nAccording to this Medium post you will not be granted EOS after the snapshot if you have EOS ERC20 as balance on an exchange.\n",

      title: "[EXIT 2019] Review of Altcoin.io Non-custodial Exchange",
      content: "Below you will find the original article about the Altcoin.IO exchange from 2017. The information there is now obsolete:\n\nAltcoin.IO was acquired by BnkToTheFuture in 2019.\n\nWarning: There is now a new landing page active at http://altcoinio.com/ which is an unrelated project. It could be an impostor, but most likely it is just someone new leveraging what was left from the clout of the original Altcoin.IO Plasma DEX. Either way, http://altcoinio.com/ is unrelated to the former DEX this article is about.\n\nIf you are looking for a reliable non-custodial platform where you can trade cryptocurrencies both for fiat as well as crypto-to-crypto via swaps, your 2020 platform to do that is called LocalCryptos.\n\nOriginal article below.\n\n\n\n\nAltcoin.io is a very promising decentralized exchange project with no ICO or VC funding backing it. The list of people involved can be found right on their homepage Altcoin.IO and includes some familiar names: Coinrun, Pizpie and Josh Olszewicz (CarpeNoctom).\n\nThe new cryptocurrency exchange that is to be launched in early 2018 and will run entirely on atomic swaps. That is, it’s going to be that kind of place that should make Shapeshift obsolete: the swap is done via a trustless contract, the fees are going to be lower, the trust in the middleman not necessary.\n\nThe mission of altcoin.io goes even further though - they are aiming to build a decentralized trading exchange that will provide better experience than exchanges like EtherDelta:\n\n\n  DEXs have been around for some time. […] While they’ve generally offered better security, they’re far from perfect. Most DEXs store your private keys on Ethereum smart contracts (using the ERC20 standard), relying on off-chain order books to fulfill your trades. This restricts the number of tradeable tokens, and slows everything down.\n\n\nWhat has been done so far\n\nThere is a preview of the UI but the exchange itself is not open yet. What is new is that you can already open an account to get access to the atomic swap wallet (on testnet for now). You’ll be able to use the same user account once the exchange opens.\n\nThe account setup is similar to bitcoin wallets - you are getting your 12-word seed. That means, your account is not tied to your real-life identity and you retain the full control of the funds you are trading with.\n\nOnce you’re in you will get access to wallets for a multitude of bitcoin-based and ethereum-based assets. You can already try out the atomic swap exchange process on the testnets, for instance with the help of a BTC testnet faucet and an ETH testnet faucet where you get coins via a tweet because of network spam protection.\n\nVideo walkthrough here has about 6 minutes, the gist is with two separate wallets in different browsers and once you have the testnet coins you can initiate a p2p atomic swap from one of the wallets. Because it’s p2p, it will generate a confirmation link for the party on the other side of the trade that you’ve just opened. Open it in the second wallet browser and okay it, it will complete the swap.\n\nIf you don’t really know what this all means there’s an article about atomic swaps on blog.altcoin.io. That blog also the place to follow if you want to get the latest updates on the exchange development.\n\nAltcoin.io Walkthrough\n\nIf this is the first time you hear about the project and you’d like to see what the app looks like first or get convinced this isn’t a crazy scam, watch BTCKYLE talking to the founders of altcoin.io on Youtube.\n\nThe walkthrough for the altcoin.io wallet and atomic swaps available from Vimeo is shorter and less chatty.\n\nSummary\n\nSo far the testnet functions of altcoin.io are impressive but really at the Shapeshift level: you can exchange one token for another, from the user point of view it’s the same experience as on Shapeshift or in a decentralized way on Bisq.\n\nIf atomic swap trading is going to be a thing, what is really needed is an advanced interface for traders because active trading is the game that will bring in the people and the liquidity. Luckily the team seems to be aware of that, the preview exchange UI looks much like prettier sister of BitMEX.\n\nFrom the blog posts it’s not even clear how far from launch the development really is, though, and it is safe to assume there’s a lot to do. It is well worth staying tuned, though. Let’s hope OP delivers…\n",

      content: "Korbit and Bithumb, the two most popular cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea, have been trading with significant premiums compared to the west for some time. It is only after yesterday’s “old news” presented as new FUD that a lot of people got interested.\n\nIf you have missed the news, yesterday the information started going around that South Korea is shutting down crypto exchanges. There is now an official message in English that explains it is just a regulation against anonymous trading which was made easier by a feature of the banking system in SK that is called “virtual account” - a bank account assigned from a pool used for instant fiat money transfers.\n\nSo is there an arb opportunity in South Korea? It is, but not as good as it looks.\n\nWhile opening an account on a Korean exchange is not a problem, moving the fiat money is both limited to residents and limited in amount. From the Crypto of Korea Kakao group:\n\n\n  Legal foreign residents are kosher, but new regulations will see the closure of accounts held by non-residents. The arb is also basically limited to about 50k USD a year as Korea has pretty tight capital restrictions.\n\n\nSo for instance a Canadian national residing in Korea can pull this off but the profit is still limited, plus he might get questioned for money laundering.\n\nFor the rest of us in the pack, there is no feasible way to profit from the premium at all. One obvious way would be via cryptocurrency but there are already enough arbitrage bots on the ratio markets that the prices of all cryptocurrencies trade with premiums there.\n\nAn introduction of a “stablecoin” pegged to whatever USD price - however unlikely that is - would be a way out but in reality people who already have ratio arb bots would jump on it and the crypto premium would be gone quickly. Similar rare (and very brief) opportunity might happen on listing of any new coin to the exchanges, if the new coin would start at a western price level. Again, people who already arb there, and that means perhaps even the exchanges themselves, would have advantage.\n\nIf you still want to monitor the prices in KRW the best way is this cryptocompare page that shows coins traded in Korea in KRW. If you are looking to follow the premium, you can do that either on TradingView or on CryptoWatch homepage if you set the third column to show prices in USD.\n",

That’s why Kraken has had job advertisements on Lever for a couple of months now, looking mainly for React JS developers to help with the upcoming engine upgrade planned for beginning of December.\n\nWhat he also explained was deploying a big upgrade is difficult with the surge in cryptocurrency valuations, the boom of crypto trading and in short rapidly increasing demand. It seems the team got lost in patching, and then patching of patches - in short, the price for not thinking ahead.\n\nConsequently we have mid December and trading on Kraken is still mostly suitable for those with suicidal tendencies.\n\nNew Kraken Upgrade Date\n\nThe new post on Kraken Exchange’s blog has a similar tone as Jesse’s post from November.\n\n\n  The recent, unexpected explosion in demand has been overwhelming.  Each of the past few days has produced 50,000 new account registrations and 10,000 new support tickets — an order of magnitude above where we were just last quarter.  Concurrent users, daily trades and volumes are also hitting new all-time highs.  We are struggling to keep up.\n\n\nThe hopefully better part of the post sets the date of the deployment to the week starting 18 December 2017.\n\n\n  Next week we will be rolling out a major systems upgrade which should resolve these scaling and load issues.  The upgrade is long overdue […]\n\n\nNow, hopefully a meme of ‘waiting for OP to deliver’ will not be fitting here.\n\nWhat is slightly more alarming is there have been some problems with fiat routes as well, although according to the blog nothing of the sorts of the cat-and-mouse game we know from Bitfinex.\n\n\n  Our fiat funding partners are also experiencing strain […] current delays are outside of the usual range, especially for domestic USD.  Cryptocurrency funding remains unaffected.\n\n\nSince trading on Kraken started being a pain the perfect availability of fiat routes has been the only reason to actually do business with Kraken. If the upgrade is a flop and fiat processing starts to be problematic there wouldn’t be much of a reason to be on Kraken at all.\n\nJoin the discussion on Reddit.\n",

Nothing - The USDT were created before the backing money arrived, the Tethers were sitting in the treasury wallet waiting to be allocated. 00:59\n  Details of the hack, 02:13: The money didn’t belong to a customer, there are no customer damages – the tokens were unassigned and have been frozen 38:05\n  The hacker probably used a malicious binary, 02:23\n  The address of the Tether treasury wallet, 09:59 look for it in the text chat.\n  Why wasn’t the treasury wallet multisig? 10:49 It was a newly created wallet that wasn’t used as treasury before (or after) the hack. Normally, Tether storage is multisig but this particular address was single-sig. It is not known why it was single-sig.\n  The server was isolated from Bitfinex servers, 13:35, and set up by different dev team than the team that works on it now.\n  The server separation is also why the hacker couldn’t steal other cryptocurrencies. As a rule, different currencies live on different servers so that they can be updated easily and they don’t get poisoned from one another if there’s malicious code, 45:50.\n\n\nTether FUD\n\n\n  Flibbr suggest a live stream with someone from Bitfinex to show the money is in the bank accounts. 15:35 (Probably not possible - banks do not want that spotlight, people are bound by NDAs.)\n  Most of the Tether FUD is anecdotal, screenshots etc, not really evidence or proof … 22:15 … plapps suggests Bitfinex deals with it better in terms of PR because the crowds go too far with their conspiracies. ChrisJ calls for more ideas on how to clear this situation (how to prove the Tethers are backed by USD and do it in a way that is not damaging to Finex nor its customers) – but says he cannot keep up with the tons of twitter messages (@MrChrisEllis) he’s getting. If you have an idea, Disqus comments here below are open.\n  35:05 Details of the Tether creation and USD backing - often, the entity that pays for the USDT creation is Bitfinex because of financing of a customer transaction via USDT. (Your USD balance on Bitfinex is not automatically USDT.)\n  Since the stolen Tethers were frozen, there can be a wild unfounded speculation that the hack was either a test or a stunt to make Tether look bad, 38:33.\n  39:13 There are security updates for Tether underway.\n  ChrisJ calls for allowing the benefit of the doubt. 44:18\n\n",

      content: "In August 2017, Trezor released a security update. It updated your firmware to version 1.5.2 as older versions of firmware could make your seedphrase visible to someone who’d steal the device, took it apart and flashed it with a hacked-up firmware.\n\nHere is the official story from Satoshi Labs:\n\n\n  It is important to note that this is not a remote execution attack. To exploit this issue, an attacker would need physical access to a disassembled TREZOR device with uncovered electronics. It is impossible to do this without destroying the plastic case.\n\n\n\n  In order to exploit this issue, an attacker would have to break into the device, destroying the case in the process. They would also need to flash the device with a specially-crafted firmware. If your device is intact, your seed is safe, and you should update your firmware to 1.5.2 as soon as possible.\n\n\n\n  With firmware 1.5.2, this attack vector is eliminated and your device is safe.\n\n\nAs it happens, the unofficial version is a lot worse:\n\n\n  The frantic patch creation we see now, before any coins have been lost (apparently), is because the issue was talked about at DEF CON 25. All Trezors, regardless of the firmware, use a chip that is vulnerable. According to the author of the article linked above, the chip will always be vulnerable in some way and Trezors are not safe unless all devices are replaced with ones that use safer chips.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurthermore:\n\n\n  Trezor so far greatly downplays the importance of this hack. There is no long-term access needed to copy all your secret information from Trezor using this hack, it can be done just in 15 seconds. If your Trezor is stolen, you don’t even have time to transfer you funds to a new address. Government authorities can access all your Bitcoins and other crypto currencies without even asking for your consent. If you are crossing an international border, TSA can easily check your balances, etc. IRL, Trezor is as safe as leaving your cash or wallet on the table. On top of all that, your Trezor can be restored to its original state or replaced with identical Trezor with the same configuration, you wouldn’t even notice any difference until it is too late.\n\n\nThe exploit surely now can be done in 15 seconds at the airport since the source code for it is public.\n\n\n  The key to performing this hack is simply connecting two pins inside the Trezor device at the right time, even paperclip is suitable for this.\n\n\n\n  Only a simple version of this hack requires the disassembly of Trezor. A more advanced version also exists. No disassembly is required!\n\n\nThe author linked a satoshibox file with an exploit for the new firmware (1.5.2) but the link is broken.\n\nWhat can you do?\n\nExtend your seed with a 25th word.\n\nPasswords in Trezor create a 25th word of a seedphrase. Trezor claims password protection makes the devices safe against this exploit, it is for researchers now to prove or disprove that.\n\nDon’t carry your Trezor on you when you cross borders.\n\nIt is the physical access that is dangerous.\n\nBuild your own cold storage solution.\n\nBack in the day, people used to use a spare laptop with Armory or Electrum on it. Electrum is the better choice now, BitcoinArmory is only maintained sporadically.\n\nLearn more about Electrum in the ATNET Glossary and links there from.\n",

      content: "Anonymous coins have always been a concern for the App Store as allegedly they didn’t want to be linked to illicit activities. If you are a DASH holder though, your situation regarding wallets is a bit less bleak than what’s normal for crypto right now.\n\nThe new official DASH wallet\n\nThe DASH wallet app was released just yesterday to the Apple App Store. It is a cryptocurrency wallet specifically for DASH and was created by the DASH Foundation, so there is no reason to worry about scams and counterfeit apps.\n\nLink to the DASH wallet\n\nZ-Cash was approved for the App Store too, but is only available via Jaxx\n\nZcash was the first anonymous cryptocurrency to get Apple’s blessings. There was a press release campaign in April 2017 announcing Apple approved ZEC for App Store, and Jaxx integrated it. Right now the Jaxx wallet for iOS from April 2017 supports both DASH and ZEC, even though the description of the app on iTunes doesn’t say so.\n\nJaxx was planning to integrate ZCASH unce upon a time even along with Monero - but that doesn’t look very likely anymore. \n\nEither way, the problem with Jaxx is the security vulnerability of Jaxx desktop version. Recently there was also a problem with the servers on which the backend is running, and people were unable to access their ETC funds for the whole weekend. There was no warning in the app, it just showed old data apparetly from a backup, and the app was frozen - not a nice way to persuade people to store their monies in it. \n\nSo, although the iOS app is not suffering from the vulnerability of the desktop wallet, it is currently collecting negative reviews on the App Store.\n\nMonero people, don’t get ahead of yourselves\n\nMonero’s situation is even better! There is a Monero wallet approved by the App Store right now but as slick as it looks, it is a scam. It has been a known scam for at least six months yet it is still available on the wonderful Apple App Store with diligent app reviews.\n",

      content: "Every couple of weeks, always on the full moon, the blackbytes airdrops were happening. If you signed a message with a BTC address before the deadline, you received free [giga]bytes and some hours later also some [giga]blackbytes.\n\nWhile the bytes can be traded on Bittrex (by millions as GBYTE), the blackbytes aren’t traded anywhere. To trade these for bytes you need to sign up to the byteball slack channel via the autoinviter here and head to #trading_blackbyte channel. The channel has a bot that works as an order book by Gigabyte per Gigablackbyte:\n\nOn the screenshot, the top of the ask book was at 0.01290 GB/GBB and top of the bid book at 0.02008 GB/GBB.\n\nGigabytes per bitcoin were trading at Bittrex around 0.24 BTC ($585) before the airdrops became popular, the ratio plummeted later.\n\nAbout Byteball\n\nByteball is a payment network that makes it easy to set conditional payments - finalize payment only if condition is met - similar to ethereum smart contracts but more user-friendly.\n\nThe way transactions are confirmed is from the high level similar to IOTA’s tangle:\n\n\n  Transactions created by users are cryptographically linked to each other, and once you add your new transaction, other users start adding theirs on top of yours, and the number of other transactions that link to your transaction grows like snowball.\n\n\nIn byteball this is called DAG (directed acyclic graph) - every new transaction references one or more earlier ones by including and signing their hashes. By including its parents, each new transaction also indirectly includes and confirms all parents of the parents, parents of the parents of the parents, and so on.\n\nThe supply is capped, there is no mining:\n\n\n  The total number of bytes is 10^15, all bytes were issued in the genesis transaction. Since the fees paid are returned into the circulation, the money supply will remain the same.\n\n\nThe difference between bytes and blackbytes is that blackbytes have enhanced privacy:\n\n\n  Private payments can be made using blackbytes, a cash-like untraceable currency. Its transactions are not visible on the public database that shows all payments made with (white)bytes. Blackbytes are sent peer-to-peer instead in an encrypted chat session.\n\n\nRead more at bitcointalk\n\nByteball airdrops\n\nIf you didn’t catch the latest airdrop, there will be another one - byteball.org has a countdown.\n\nCurrently the next one is scheduled for March 2, 2018. Also, at the moment the reward is shifting towards holders of GB who didn’t sell after the airdrop:\n\n\n  For every 16 BTC you receive 0.1 GB (1 gigabyte = 1 billion bytes),\n  For every 1 GB you receive additional 0.1 GB.\n\n\nJust for anyone who’s interested: To enter the byteball airdrop you needed to download byteball wallet and from it enter into a chat bot. SegWit BTC addresses were not supported.\n\nQuite different from today’s airdrops and whitelists.\n",

      title: "Economics of Proof of Stake",
      content: "The gist of PoS\n\nIn Proof-of-work (PoW) the longest chain is valid, as in the one with most work. In Proof-of-stake the one that is agreed upon in betting consensus is accepted.\n\nIn the proposed version of proof of stake in ETH, stakers make bets on which block will be included in the blockchain. The block that is backed up by most bets is the winning one. The betting is automated and has several rounds as the odds of reaching consensus at each block changes. The initial bets are small, when a leader starts to emerge the bets grow.\n\nThe betting happens automatically. All the staker has to do is to put a full node online and lock up their stake for four months. In the last published at least 32 ETH is needed to participate in staking.\n\nWill staking pay off?\n\nIf one wants to focus only on profits, staking could be compared to lending at an exchange. Bets made on the winning block get rewarded, the rest is lost. That means there will have to be losses too, but thanks to the system of several betting rounds the losses should be small - the bets start small and move higher once there’s higher confidence regarding the winning block.\n\nIt is simply lots of tiny gambles with the odds in the staker’s favor.\n\nThere is a counterparty risk as well though: staker loses his lot if it appears that he is engaged in an illicit anti-network activity. This ban from staking is for Vitalik and his crew to judge.\n\nAnother small risk comes from volatility of ETH - should a big dump be obvious, staker cannot withdraw his money to sell, but this can be hedged with the help of derivatives.\n\nBut practically, staking could be more profitable than lending on an exchange, just probably not for individuals at home as they’d have to run a full node. Running a full node costs energy, maintenance and bandwidth and we all know that even though setting up a parity wallet to make a basic transaction is a matter of an hour max, the full ethereum blockchain has a fat ass.\n\nThere probably is an incentive for the ETH fanbois to prefer staking to lending on an exchange though, because as stakers they would be “helping the good cause”.\n\nIt seems that Vitalik is aware of these sentiments that are outside of economics, but it is anyone’s guess if he has plans to use them:\n\n\n\nImage: From Vitalik’s medium.com post “A Proof of Stake Design Philosophy”\n\n\n\nHow is it really with the centralization and unfair advantages\n\nThe most promoted advantage of proof of stake is that it fights centralization of mining that seems to always emerge in Proof-of-work after some time.\n\nPoW: If you are late to the party or don’t have access to cheap electricity or don’t have enough capital to constantly upgrade your mining equipment, your mining profits will not pay for your expenses - at least not until your coin increases in price, and if you should be waiting for that it would make more sense to simply trade. In addition to this you are fighting mining cartels that might be engaged in selfish mining.\n\n\n  “Selfish Mining”: A group of miners can form a pool that behaves as single agent […] following some strategy. Selfish-Mine allows a pool of sufficient size to obtain a revenue larger than its ratio of mining power.\n\n\n\n  The key insight behind the selfish mining strategy is to force the honest miners into performing wasted computations on the stale public branch. […] Selfish miners achieve this goal by selectively revealing their mined blocks to invalidate the honest miners’ work. Approximately speaking, the selfish mining pool keeps its mined blocks private, secretly bifurcating the blockchain and creating a private branch. Meanwhile, the honest miners continue mining on the shorter, public branch.\n\n\nPoS:\nIf ETH main office says you cheat, you lose your stake. If ETH main office says you are honest, you get transaction fees and the block reward. Your profit is proportional to how much you stake, nothing else - there is no difficulty, there will be some hardware maintenance but not as much as with PoW. If you have more starting capital you will earn more, but proportionally more - you are not supposed to get an edge when you have more money.\n\nTo put it bluntly, if everything should work as drafted it would mean that the business of staking would not scale the way the business of mining does, but  while at the same time staking would not pay off for small individual participants, similarly as with mining of well established coins.\n\nThis kind of anti-capitalistic compromise understandably causes some stir, but Vitalik is clearly bigger than that:\n\n\n\nImage: via @BitfuryGeorge\n\n\n\nAnd to add to this: it is not even quite clear that Proof-of-stake is really free from all this unfairness.\n\nWhat’s  not clear\n\n\n  Staker A owns 100 ETH and stakes all 100 of it. Staker B owns 100 000 ETH and stakes all of it but into 1000 different accounts. Has Staker B has 1000x chance to find the block over Staker A?\n  What if all the stakers are the same staker? How would anyone know?\n\n\nThe answers to this would probably be that this is an attack, there might be a fork - you know the drill. It is unclear how would this be detected.\n\n\n  If a staker-attacker has an ETH short equal or more than his stake and is the majority network validator, then the staker-attacker has nothing to lose. The currency will lose in value but the staker-attacker has the short to profit from the drop.\n\n\nWhile there is an argument that it is not possible to short this much ETH on any exchange, it might be possible in the future if there are more highly leveraged futures or option markets available. One could also long Alt/ETH pairs.\n\n\n  The “nothing at stake” problem: In the case of a consensus failure stakers have nothing to lose by voting for multiple blockchain-histories, which prevents the consensus from ever resolving. Because there is little cost in working on several chains (unlike in proof-of-work systems), anyone can abuse this problem “for free”.\n\n\nIn one Ethereum implementation called slasher, this behavior would fall under “cheating” and would lead to the loss of the stake, but slasher introduces other problems - what if most staking nodes drop out (blockchain generation freezes, called “ice age”) and what if there is no consensus (blockchain generation gets stuck). You can read the whole mildly technical explanation at ethereum’s github. Casper should work with some form of slashing conditions.\n\n\n\nIn the Ethereum roadmap, the switch to Proof-of-stake is planned for June 2018 (the switch has been postponed several times). At this stage, of course Proof-of-stake in ETH is not ready yet, but what is the hype all about, really?\n\nPoS is not convenient for big miners, it is not convenient for hobby miners/stakers, it is not convenient for traders &amp; holders because it introduces new possible problems and reasons for forks - but it’s the next big thing because it is a system that is “more fair” and also “eco friendly”? Quite serious there?\n\nFrankly it does not really scream advantages, other than what relates to “Vitalik philosophy”:\n\n\n\nImage: From Vitalik’s medium.com post “A Proof of Stake Design Philosophy”\n\n\n\nReading:\n\n\n  https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Proof-of-Stake-FAQ\n  https://github.com/ethereum/economic-modeling/tree/master/casper\n  Paper on Selfish Mining\n\n\n\n\nUpdate, 13 Jul ‘17\n\nTuur Demeester published critique of Vitalik’s piece on the PoS.\n\nVitalik’s response and discussion here\n",

      title: "Is the end of ICOs approaching?",
      content: "A lot changed for initial coin offerings during the summer 2016.\n\nLawmakers have noticed\n\nThere has been a post on 2nd May 2017 at law111 and elsewhere that caught the attention of the crypto community. To be honest, it was an interesting thing for some die hard bitcoiners since they started projecting the EndOfEtherium™ - the ICOs will get regulated, there will be no reason to buy ETH anymore, ETH will collapse and BTC will get it’s market cap share back. It is a bit too far out there, nonetheless there seem to be regulations in the making. The post on law111 says:\n\n\n  In early 2017, multiple state legislatures have taken action reflecting their recognition of the potential impact of virtual currency and blockchain technology. These actions have ranged from requests for further information regarding the technology to an active debate regarding a specific use case.\n\n\n…continuing with a state-by-state US legislations.\n\nIn a more human readable form, this was discussed at crowdfundinginsider.com in March already:\n\n\n  For those of you not familiar with what ICOs are, here’s a quick summary. Lots of folks working in the blockchain world needed money to fund their project or startup. So they decided to invent their own “coin” variant and sold those coins to fund their project/startup, in exchange for some financial upside in the project.\n\n\n\n  Sound familiar? That’s because it is. This is the story of every capital-hungry startup/business/entrepreneur.\n\n\n\n  I’ve heard ICOs described as a “donation with financial upside” or “crowdsale” (whatever that is), and a number of other things—to try to avoid securities laws. First of all, a donation is a donation— you’re giving away money (or bitcoin), and there is no financial upside to a donation. A “crowdsale” of tokens—to the extent those “tokens” represent securities—is still a security. There are a number of different things that ICOs are doing, so it’s difficult to address the entire industry in one article, but let me impart some guidance to make this easier to understand: If walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, its probably a duck.\n\n\nEric Voorhees was the first to test the waters\n\nThe penalty for such offense is a fine and restriction for the person that was the head of the enterprise - typically they cannot serve as a chief executive of any company again, or they cannot raise capital again. This is supposed to mean the end of the person’s career although apparently Eric Voorhees is still around and doing well.\n\n\n  June 3, 2014, via SEC.gov/litigation – Respondent has undertaken to: Forgo directly or indirectly, including, but not limited to, through any entity owned or controlled by Respondent, participating in any issuance of any security in an unregistered\ntransaction, in exchange for bitcoins or other virtual currency, for a period of five years.\n\n\nHis later crypto-focused company that he founded, ShapeShift, had normal funding rounds like your usual startup would have.\n\nWhat is the regulation actually for?\n\nWell, it is supposed to be a way to check the entrepreneur, in theory it should reduce the amount of scam artists in the industry.\n\nFirst thing, however, it is safe to say it will take the regulators a while to figure out how to deal with the very new thing an ICO is.\n\nAnother thing is, many people who had done ICOs before are certainly safe. There is several hundreds of crypto tokens by now. Some of them were funded by pseudonymous identities. In some cases the project that was backing them doesn’t exist anymore. Nobody will ever know.\n\nWait…is there a way this could possibly be done in the future as well? Could this actually mean the scams will not go away, not even with the regulation?\n\nNew ICOs in 2017\n\nTim Draper has been “the person in the news” this week when he announced his participation in Tezos token ICO. Some people even said, this might be the last ICO before regulations so I might just invest. That’s totally a … reason /s.\n\nVia Reuters News on pehub.com:\n\n\n  Draper, an early supporter of bitcoin and its underlying blockchain financial ledger technology, told Reuters in an interview he will for the first time participate in a so-called “initial coin offering” (ICO) of Tezos slated later [in May 2017].\n“The best thing I can do is lead by example,” said Draper, on his plan to participate in Tezos’ token offering. “Over time, I actually feel that some of these tokens are going to improve the world, and I want to make sure those tokens get promoted as well. I think Tezos is one of those tokens.”\n\n\nWith someone so influential backing a token, this could likely be a self fulfulling prophecy.\n\nTezos\n\nTezos is a self-governing technology running with proof of stake. All upgrades and changes can be done automatically, without forking and without political infights. There should also be incentive for making the inovation on the Tezos ledger rather than forking off an appcoin. The Tezor creators argue the appcoins dilute the value of the parent coin rather than contribute to the network effect.\n\nTezos Homepage\n\nYour usual popular ICO 2017 resources:\n\n\n  \n    Facebook Group - closed group, login and ask for membership. The group is not very active, mostly just people posting announcements.\n  \n  \n    ICO Countdown - the only site that has been featured here in 2016 and stays top.\n  \n  \n    Icoindex.comand their Slack channel - they are also on facebook and are not getting very good reviews.\n  \n\n\nYou still have to make your own decision\n\nLook at the idea, the team, the marketing, the roadmap and last but not least the token. The price, the allocation (how much will the developers have?) and inflation.\n\nThe market cap thing is flawed, there is a good in-depth article about that on blog.sia.tech:\n\n\n  Take Zcash for example. It has a current market cap of $110 million with a total supply of 1.2 million ZEC, but over the next five years 9.8 million ZEC will enter existence. This super-high inflation will drastically increase supply each year, which in turn will affect the market cap. There is no way, however, for the average investor to quickly discover this inflation factor.\n\n\n\n  We recommend adding a new metric called inflation factor that indicates how the market cap could be affected over the next five years by token inflation:\n\n\nInflation factor = (new supply over 5 years) / (current total supply) * 100%.\n\n\n  Inflation factors calculated for the top 15 tokens here.\n\n\nYou see that only by making economically sound decision rather than spreading your money randomly across all ICOs will shrink the amount of feasible ICOs a lot. But indeed, reason is never enough to stop the bubble.\n",

      title: "Time in the Market vs Timing the Market",
      content: "Let’s take a quick look at the difference between trading and investing.\n\nWhen you trade you don’t care which way the market goes as long as your position is making you money. All you need is to be right about the direction. For what it’s worth, even if you hold a shitcoin with absolutely no future and it pumps, you are making money - not that it wouldn’t resemble casino though.\n\nWhen you invest you are looking for value and you put in money that you realistically won’t need even in a few years time. You go for value.\n\nWhich one is more profitable?\n\nThey say that in the long run, time in the market beats timing the market.\n\nWith the short term direction, there are so many variables and unknowns. Even if you combine technical and fundamental analysis together with market sentiment from online forums, the best you can get is what’s likely to happen as long as the current conditions last. And in crypto, things can change fast.\n\nRealistically you have much higher chance to be wrong in timing the market than you have when carefully picking an asset which you think has a long term chance.\n\n\n  Time in the market is so much more important for an investor’s long-term returns than timing the market. This is something The Motley Fool takes to heart, because no one can accurately know when to get in and get out.  […] “Generally that tends to be true. But, alas, there are no firm rules here, and context is king in pretty much all of this. For example, there are times where valuations get super lofty.” - via The Motley Fool\n\n\nHodling: When your biggest risk is losing your position\n\nThese days everyone hates the hodler cult in both BTC and ETH.\n\nThe truth is though, the HODL position is just a type of ultra long-term “long”. It’s not true that hodlers risk nothing: Their bullish opinion can be wrong, the market appreciation can be derailed off by circumstances, it can take decades before an asset moves up from “severely underpriced”.\n\nBut if we discount the risk of your poor judgement, as a hodler who is in a market for the long run, your biggest risk then will be only that of losing your position. The best way to lose it, fully or in part, is to try and sell high to rebuy lower.\n\nIf you want to hold a cryptocurrecy, you should value it as underpriced enough to be OK with riding out the occasional retracement.\n\nSo, how do you judge a crypto asset to see if you want to hold it for the long haul?\n\nInvestors look at the following characteristics:\n\n1/ Real-World Adoption™ - That’s why Ethereum on Alphabay is bigger a deal than Raiden network even though Raiden is really cool.\n\n2/ Transactions per day which is related to adoption, because it shows actual daily network activity.\n\n3/ Exchange volume per day and (anti)correlation with bitcoin to see how much of the daily network transfers is speculation.\n\nFood for thought: An unlikely altcoin fundamental\n\n\n\nWhat would happen if Ethereum lost Vitalik? Something quite explicit for sure, right?\n\n\n  “Go for a business that any idiot can run - because sooner or later, an idiot probably is going to run it.” - Peter Lynch\n\n\nI believe this is a drawback of Ethereum as an investment asset. That doesn’t mean ETH wasn’t an outstanding trading opportunity couple years ago - but that’s precisely the difference between trading and investment.\n\nFor the long long term, it’s a question how sustainable this is.\n\nNow, compare it to other popular altcoins on the market.\n\nI am sure there are people who believe some coins are lead by idiots at present already, while other coins are quickly getting there.\n\nThis is crypto. Holding on to an asset with slow development and moronic leaders might not be such a bad idea.\n\nAfter all the longer the assets are surviving this misfortune the more valuable they are for the long run.\n\n\n",

The technical merits of why Litecoin should be worth more than $0 are few and far between. Litecoin exists on life support only because Chinese traders for some reason enjoy trading it.\n\n\nLitecoin is some form of legacy. A BTC spinoff dangerously close to bitcoin only with the advantage of faster transactions, it is easy to implement for an exchange that already does BTC. The reason most people who aren’t bagholders buy and sell litecoin is they are bitcoin traders and want to move USD from one exchange to the other whenever BTC is too volatile or too FUD-ridden to be safely in. By the way, that’s also what people sometimes use DOGE for but LTC is more widely supported. For one thing, it’s the only non-fiat and non-BTC way to get out of OkCoin.\n\nFirst class and second class\n\nOver time this developed into a popular strategy: Altcoin traders might trade the first class altcoins - think Ethereum or Monero. Once they feel like the bull cycle is soon to be over they park the money in the second grade alts that remain more or less stable. With the money in the second class they wait for another opportunity in the first class.\n\nThe second class coins rarely dump without pumping first so it’s not a totally unreasonable idea, especially if you don’t pick the parking coin completely by random. Sometimes the second grade coins do pump which makes for a nice benefit.\n\nThe Reason™\n\nNevertheless it wouldn’t be a proper pump without people coming up with arbitrary rationalization of the surge. In the case of the Litecoin surge the rationalization says it’s network scaling implementation that is currently still argued about in BTC. This way LTC could be a flagship - if anything the market is letting everybody know that little less conversation little more action please is what makes the community happy.\n\nThis is from btc_joe’s TradingView idea:\n\n\n  In a world where bitcoin gets bigger and bigger (and thus less and less likely to make any consensus changes whether it be a hard fork or segwit, etc), ask yourself, does litecoin deserve a place in the market? I certainly have my opinion.  Not to mention, if it gets the lightning network before bitcoin…are you excited about this technology? I certainly am.\n\n\nIndeed, this news came in a moment where the market was so to say available to be affected by the news.\n\nLitecoin was in a downtrend for all of 2016. Technically the price (relatively to BTC) was closing towards a support back from pre-pump 2013 (see BTC-e Quandl data https://www.quandl.com/data/BTCE/BTCLTC).\n\n\n\nSoon after that the BTC ETF and BU FUD took over which helped as well. On the April fool’s day someone started signaling segwit on the LTC network originally as a joke but lo and behold, traders took it quite seriously because the discussion was ongoing since February already, see this medium.com post:\n\n\n  With the adoption of Segregated Witness and the announcements of support progressing quickly within the Litecoin network, we may first get to see the full benefits of this technology on one of the original altcoins. With a smaller market cap and some distance from contentious Bitcoin politics, Litecoin is able to take greater risks. It may get to be the first to see this incredible innovation in action.\n\n\nLaggards beware\n\n\n\nImage: You see that squishy?\n\nLitecoin @GDAX vol is over $10M. @brian_armstrong, I think it&#39;s time we let people easily buy LTC with fiat on @coinbase. What do you say? 😁&mdash; Charlie Lee (@SatoshiLite) 6 April 2017\n\nThe prognosis of Arthur Hayes in his newsletter is that LTC is bound to go down since GDAX got the USD pair too when it showed such a pretty activity now.\n\nIt is likely that this is what’s going to happen: GDAX is the exchange removed far from the Poloniex altcoin trading epicenter. It’s where a newly listed altcoin might be bought by laggards who don’t really know much about its market but hope to still make a buck.\n\nThey’ll be buying the coins sold by those who bought at Polo early enough.\n\nThe Technicals\n\nFrom the cryptowatch snapshot above you’ll probably be able to tell the current action looks like wave 4. The people who timed it right took their profits but there is still some buying by those who came a bit late. It should still make for one more up before crashing though, and how big the crash will be, nobody knows.\n\n\n\nAfter all, altcoins in general are in a bull market. As such, the end of the wave cycle shouldn’t be as dreary as it was in 2013. In a bull market, the end of the cycle could be a simple consolidation and after a few weeks there could be more of the movement up north - see the image from the BTCUSD market.\n\nIn this case one should look into fundamentals for clarity.\n\nAnd in the case of litecoin, this doesn’t end up on a positive note: no real adoption, not much innovation. For cryptogeeks it’s a legacy, it’ll stick around for some time no matter what, but in the real world litecoin as a name is nonexistent. That shouldn’t make for an exciting future…Unless.\n\nThe lightning network plans\n\n…Unless LN. The Lightning Network can bridge channels between different blockchains, possibly allowing users to use their LTC at places that accepts Bitcoin.\n\nCharlie Lee via litecointalk.io:\n\n\n  (Y)ou may wonder why I’m pushing for SegWit. Litecoin does not have a block size problem. That’s right, and SegWit is not just a block scaling solution. I would even say block scaling is just a side benefit of SegWit. The main fix is transaction malleability, which would allow Lightning Networks (LN) to be built on top of Litecoin.\n\n\n\n  (S)ome people say LN on Bitcoin will kill any reason to use Litecoin. If people can do instantaneous transactions on Bitcoin, why would they use Litecoin? My gut feel is that this is not the case. […] LN nodes will charge a fee for LN txns going through them and that fee will be relative to the Bitcoin network fee. So Bitcoin LN txns will be more expensive than Litecoin LN txns. It may make economic sense for a LN txn to go via Litecoin and back to Bitcoin to get the cheapest rate. Lightning makes this possible because it allows the two LN to be interoperable. I don’t know that this use case will be economical or not, but we won’t know until both LNs are built and running.\n\n\nSegwit Activation Litecoin\n\nFollow segwit.co/ltc to see whether segwit was activated yet. It should be activated in mid May 2017.\n\n\n\nFollow the LTCBTC pair technicals on TradingView via this btc_joe’s idea from 23 February - it gets updated daily.\n\nFollow Charlie Lee on twitter https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite.\n",

      title: "About the proposed Ethereum ETF",
      content: "\n\nImage: The surveillance section of the rule change seems to be the key part after the rejection of Winklevoss COIN ETF. EtherIndex’s suggestion seems more plausible.\n\n\n\nUpdate - September 2017\n\nEtherIndex has withdrawn their application. Full document at sec.gov\n\n\n\nAfter the SEC disapproved the rule change to allow listing of Bitcoin ETF on the 10th of March 2017 the majority opinion has been along the lines that other cryptocurrency ETFs most likely don’t have a chance because all cryptocurrency markets are unregulated. Nonetheless there is a nice twist in the rule change for ETH ETF - an idea that didn’t appear in the Bitcoin rule change.\n\nEtherIndex - The ETH Exchange Traded Fund\n\nThe initial S-1 filling for the ETH fund appeared in July 2016 after the SEC opening a proposal for the COIN ETF for public comment and also right after a filing by SolidX to launch a Bitcoin ETF. Laura Shin of Forbes commented the “filing appears to be hastily put together”:\n\n\n  EtherIndex itself was only founded a month ago, and its filing is mostly incomplete, acting more as a shell or placeholder. It does not name an exchange, ticker, trustee or administrator. via forbes.com\n\n\nThe S-1 Filing\n\nThis is a snippet from the filing itself. It introduces Ether by comparison to Bitcoin.\n\n\n  As filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 15, 2016\n\n\n\n  Ether is a digital asset (“Digital Asset”) similar to bitcoin that is not issued by any government, bank or central organization. […] The Ethereum Network is a recent technological innovation, and the ether that is created, transferred, used and stored by entities and individuals have certain features associated with several types of assets, most notably commodities and currencies.\n\n\n\n  The Trust’s Sponsor is EtherIndex LLC, a Delaware limited liability company formed on June 15, 2016.\n\n\n\n  via sec.gov\n\n\nHowever, further down in the text it clears up distinctions between Ether and Bitcoin.\n\n\n  While the bitcoin network permits users primarily to execute value transfers, the Ethereum Network allows users to program any arbitrary code and execute it, including value transfers. […] The Ethereum Network may be viewed as a global, decentralized computer in comparison to the bitcoin network, which is more\nsimilar to a global, decentralized payment network.\n\n\n\n  via sec.gov\n\n\nThe filing also explains that as Bitcoin is meant more like a store of value it has a cap on the amount of BTC that will be ever mined. It goes on to say that ETH has no such cap and more Ether will be created as needed, but the utility of Ether is primarily not a store of value or a payment system.\n\nThe nonexistent cap has been controversial ans is also the reason why this moneymorning.com article claims that an ETH ETF can never work - it is supposed to be a bad idea since ETH has no cap on the amount of Ether that will be created.\n\nThe Rule Change\n\nThe rule change to allow listing of an ETF trading Ether shares was published in January 2017. The ETH ETF should be listed under NYSE Arca Equities.\n\n\n  Release No. 34-79792; File No. SR-NYSEARCA-2016-176, January 13, 2017\n\n\n\n  Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1)1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Act”)2 and\nRule 19b-4 thereunder,3 notice is hereby given that, on December 30, 2016, NYSE Arca, Inc.\n(the “Exchange” or “NYSE Arca”) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the\n“Commission”) the proposed rule change […] The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments\non the proposed rule change from interested persons.\n\n\n\n  The Exchange proposes to list and trade shares of the following under NYSE Arca\nEquities Rule 8.201: EtherIndex Ether Trust (“Trust”).\n\n\nFor the EtherIndex ETF, Coinbase is supposed to be the custodian and the pricing should be based on GDAX dollar price of ETH.\n\n\n  The\nExchange proposes to list and trade shares (“Shares”) of the Trust pursuant to NYSE Arca\nEquities […] The sponsor of the Trust is EtherIndex LLC (“Sponsor”), a Delaware limited liability\ncompany. Delaware Trust Company is the trustee of the Trust (“Trustee”). The Bank of New\nYork Mellon will be the administrator (“Administrator”) and custodian of cash of the Trust\n(“Cash Custodian”). Coinbase will be the custodian of the ether of the Trust (“Ether\nCustodian”).\n\n\n\n  via sec.gov (Release No. 34-79792; File No. SR-NYSEARCA-2016-176)\n\n\nFor one thing, the participation of Coinbase/GDAX itself seems to be a better idea compared to the Winklevoss Gemini - an exchange that doesn’t have much volume and was probably created only with the ETF in mind.\n\nThe interesting part comes with the Surveillance section of the ETH ETF rule change though.\n\nIf you didn’t care about the Bitcoin ETF much you might not know it but insufficient control over BTC markets (both spot and derivatives) was the most prominent critic the SEC mentioned in their order disapproving the COIN ETF.\n\n\n  Order disapproving rule change for COIN ETF: […] the Commission is disapproving this proposed rule change because it does not find the proposal to be consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Exchange Act,\nwhich requires […] to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices […]\n\n\n\n  […] First, the\nexchange must have surveillance-sharing agreements with significant markets for trading the\nunderlying commodity or derivatives on that commodity. And second, those markets must be\nregulated. Based on the record before it, the Commission believes that the significant markets for\nbitcoin are unregulated.\n\n\n\n  via sec.gov (Release No. 34-80206; File No. SR-BatsBZX-2016-30)\n\n\nThe SEC didn’t like the fact that majority of BTC trading occurs on exchanges out of their reach. Should a manipulation occur the SEC also wouldn’t be able to find out who’s causing it.\n\nThe surveillance-sharing agreement was a term that caught on quickly at Bitcoin trading forums. It quickly solidified into “the SEC wanted access to data about customers, exchanges didn’t want to provide it”. How did this surveillance-sharing agreement come about? It was the central point of the Bats rule change for COIN ETF:\n\n\n  Bats rule change / Surveillance: The Exchange believes that its surveillance procedures are adequate to properly monitor\nthe trading of the Shares on the Exchange during all trading sessions and to deter and detect\nviolations of Exchange rules and the applicable federal securities laws. […] The Exchange may obtain information regarding trading in the Shares via the Intermarket Surveillance Group\n(“ISG”), from other exchanges who are members or affiliates of the ISG, or with which the\nExchange has entered into a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement. In addition, the\nExchange may obtain information about bitcoin transactions, trades and market data from\nBitcoin Exchanges with which the Exchange has entered into a comprehensive surveillance\nsharing agreement as well as certain additional information that is publicly available through the\nBlockchain. The Exchange notes that it has entered into a comprehensive surveillance sharing\nagreement with Gemini Exchange.\n\n\n\n  via sec.gov (Release No. 34-78262; File No. SR-BatsBZX-2016-30)\n\n\nWas it the Winkletwins’ idea that exchanges should agree to provide data so that there can be an ETF listed? There is no mention about surveillance-sharing agreement in the EtherIndex rule change. Instead, the exchange pleads to monitor the market and intervene in case there is an anomaly in the trading activity which could potentially be a manipulation.\n\nGiven enough data this sounds like a plausible way to detect manipulation while at the same time there is no agreement needed whatsoever: the market data are freely accessible.\n\n\n  NYSE rule change / Surveillance: The Exchange represents that trading in the Shares will be subject to the existing trading\nsurveillances administered by the Exchange, as well as cross-market surveillances administered\nby the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) on behalf of the Exchange\n\n\n\n  The surveillances referred to above generally focus on detecting securities trading outside\ntheir normal patterns, which could be indicative of manipulative or other violative activity.\nWhen such situations are detected, surveillance analysis follows and investigations are opened,\nwhere appropriate, to review the behavior of all relevant parties for all relevant trading\nviolations.\n\n\n\n  via sec.gov (Release No. 34-79792; File No. SR-NYSEARCA-2016-176)\n\n\nThe rule change also states that price of Ether shares should be determined based on GDAX ETHUSD market but if the market will seem unhealthy, a Kraken pricing might be used. If Kraken is not available, it would be Gemini. If no big American exchange provides reasonable data, the pricing of Ether shares can be set manually.\n\n\n  […] if the Sponsor determines that the Kraken Bitcoin Exchange and the Gemini\nExchange prices are not appropriate bases for evaluation of the Trust’s ether, the Sponsor’s [EtherIndex LLC] good\nfaith estimate of the market price of ether.\n\n\n\n  via sec.gov (Release No. 34-79792; File No. SR-NYSEARCA-2016-176)\n\n\nOf course one question is whether there was a reason the Winklevoss brothers opted for the tedious and probably next to impossible route of surveillance agreements - or whether simply nobody considered this way. In the recent days Bats filed a petition for the SEC to change their decision and list the COIN ETF after all but even now there has been no change made to the proposal. And another question is indeed what will the SEC actually say to the EtherIndex suggested solution for the surveillance and control problem. We’ll have to wait for that.\n\nLast but not least, one thing that could surely help the ETH ETF is the majority of ETH/fiat trading occurs in the US. Only very small amount of ETH/fiat trading happens in China and Russia.\n\n\n\nImage: An illustration, not a statistics! Volume distribution across countries for ETH/fiat pairs in the top 20 ETH markets. Single day data only, via coinmarketcap.com. View as PDF\n\nAfter all, from a legacy investor point of view it does not make such a fundamental difference whether to invest in Bitcoin or in Ether. The two currencies trade like competitors, very often they are inversely correlated, while both of them are equally uncorrelated with all of the legacy markets.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne more important detail\n\nEthereum is backed by https://entethalliance.org/. The EEA is a group of about 30 companies that include Accenture, JPMorgan Chase or Intel.\n",

      title: "(2017 Report) Alphabay to adopt ETH for payments ahead of new privacy features",
      content: "\n\nImage: In the months to come ETH should get payments privacy enhancements which could mean a big change in fundamentals.\n\n\n\nToday Alphabay posted an announcement on their subreddit stating that they are implementing ETH for payments. The implementation should be operational by May 1st 2017.\n\nFollowing the popularity of the new altcoin Ethereum and the recent price\nhike showing a growing interest, Alphabay has made the decision to start\naccepting Ethereum for marketplace listing purchases.\n\nWe are currently laying out the framework to make ETH acceptance possible,\nand we will enable Ethereum deposits and withdrawals starting May 1st, 2017.\nVendors wishing to accept Ethereum can edit their listings and set the \"Accept\nETH\" to \"On\" in order to be able to be paid in Ethereum.\n\nWe have plenty of new stuff in the works, so expect more updates in the near\nfuture.\n\n\nThere was some backlash against this news since ETH is not currently meant as a cash-like payment system and transactions are easily traceable, as opposed to Monero transactions. However, in the months to come ETH should start support zkSNARKs which would put the transaction privacy on the level with ZCASH.\n\nThe abbreviation zk-SNARK means “zero knowledge succinct argument of knowledge”.\n\n\n  \n\n\n zkSNARKs in Ethereum, and Baby ZoE  von Feng-Ren Tsai\n\nThese days an ETH transaction gets confirmed within seconds which is a relief for everyone coming in from the BTC blockchain. However, ETH doesn’t have any magical scaling solution - under Bitcoin’s occasional network load the Ethereum blockchain wouldn’t perform much better. Nevertheless this is not an issue ETH should be facing in the months to come.\n\n\n\nAdding the privacy enhancements to ETH would give it a significant advantage: ETH would become a private coin that is being actively developed, is easily available on most exchanges and can be stored comfortably in both light clientsand cold storage.\n\nMeanwhile Monero holders still need to resort to downloading the full blockchain if they want to store the altcoin on their computer and DASH seems to be rebranding and refocusing away from “the private coin” image to “the easy payment system” image in spite of its lack of merchant adoption. Not to mention Bitcoin - the oldest cryptocurrency is currently amidst the FUD over potential network split. The market is taking a dive even though the news is probably exaggerated since it is not clear whether the fork will indeed happen at all in the first place, let alone any time soon.\n\nNonetheless ETH could potentially profit greatly from this situation.\n\n\n\nRead the update on ZCASH integration on the Ethereum blog\n",

      content: "\n  One of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges by volume, Bitfinex, was hacked in August 2016. They suffered a substantial monetary loss of 72 million USD in cryptocurrencies (based on exchange rates from August 2016) that was eventually returned to traders in form of redemption tokens, or RRT. Before that happened, users got a “haircut” – a socialized loss of 36% regardless of whether their assets were affected.\n\n\n\n  RRT is a token issued on the Omni platform to makeup for the USD value of the loss that was tradeable and eventually was paid for to the USD value of the user losses. This was a unique solution and some people who traded the token actively made good profits on it.\n\n\n\n  Zane Tackett mentioned throughout the original article has since stopped working for Bitfinex.\n\n\nOriginal post from August 2016:\n\nReddit’s reactions\n\nIf you are reading this bit chances are you didn’t miss all the drama. The best source of information is probably their status page at bitfinex.statuspage.io, though the information is scarce. Zane Tackett /u/zanetackett is trying to keep the facade of the company and panic hasn’t kicked in but as for useful info he doesn’t provide much.\n\nDuring the heist, only BTC assets were in fact taken by the hacker. Bad news for all ETH, ETC or LTC traders is that even though their assets were not affected by the hack, it seems they are lost too - just as USD assets, which were unaffected as well.\n\nAug 6, 2016: The most likely outcome is some form socialized loss - a haircut - if it can be made in a legal way. The official statement however is still “we have not decided yet”. Most traders conclude it was actually quite expected after the spectacular 24h downtime couple of weeks earlier during wild price movements. Though Kraken fails like this too, repeatedly, and no hack occured as of yet - so take out of it what you like.\n\nRecording of Zane Tackett’s press conference on Whalepool TS:\n\nvocaroo.com\n\n\n  Yes, Bitfinex takes part in paying the missing money. All customers will get a haircut of 36%. The hack wasn’t done via logging into customers accounts. There will be a shitcoin released to pay for the 36% that will not be paid back right now.

It was hosted on an AWS - experts might cringe at that but Gemini also run on AWS and OKCoin International was too. Ask the bot coders - they know where to put their codes to be in the same datacenter as the exchange. There is no exchange that would keep their own bare metal in a server room. Cost cutting wins.\n\nOnly thing we can do is to NEVER baghold or anything like that: Send money to exchange, do the trade, send them to Trezor.\n\n\n  Who runs Bitfinex anyway?\n\n\nComment from discussion [Daily Discussion] Saturday, August 06, 2016.\n\n\nBitfinex’s CEO is a Dutchman Jean-Louis van der Velde. Here is his LinkedIn. Their risk manager is also public on LinkedIn - here. Their PR representative Zane Tackett is well known to anyone on Reddit - /u/zanetackett, loyal till his death and beyond. His boss is Phill Potter. However none of these people actually developed Bitfinex. The platform was made by a freelance sysadmin Raphael Nicolle with codebase from Bitcoinica, an exchange that was hacked back in the 2012.\n\n\n  Is someone liable for something? They had BitGo which is insured..?\n\n\nBitfinex used to advertize on their website the assets were insured through BitGo which handled their wallets.\n\nThe insurance however doesn’t cover this hack. BitGo supplied Bitfinex with an implementation of segregated user-specific wallets to fill the regulatory requirements that were raised by futures regulatory commissions - margin swaps offered on Finex were basically a futures product without the user specific wallets. However Bitfinex had complete control over the BitGo implementation and turned off some of its security functions (like, limits on withdrawals) for convenience.\n\nComment from discussion [Daily Discussion] Thursday, August 04, 2016.\n\n\nUSD funds for verified USA customers that came from US bank accounts were insured via SynapsePay.\n\n\n  Are now other exchanges that use BitGo vulnerable?\n\n\nKraken uses BitGo but with a different setup:\n\nComment from discussion Kraken, you are up to bat..\n\n\nPoloniex … Well, who knows anything about Poloniex, right?\n\n\n  Is there still hope?\n\n\nBitfinex reps said the company will not pay for the losses of its customers. Bitstamp did, but the loss was smaller and they had VC funding. The only way a VC might want to flow into Bitfinex would probably be via an acquisition.\n\nBitfinex’s daily volume was known and it seems that a hack of this size wasn’t such a big hit really. However, Bitfinex reps refuse to state the exchange’s net worth.\n\nComment from discussion Bitfinex down due to bitcoin security breach.\n\n\n\n  The price action coming from this?\n\n\nThere was a major dump.\n\nComment from discussion [Daily Discussion] Saturday, August 06, 2016.\n\n\n",

      title: "All about the DAO hack",
      content: "\n\nImage: DAOs have a critical vulnerability that can probably be removed only by a hard fork.\n\n\n\nThe DAO hack simplified\n\nGreat summary can be found on erratasec blog.\n\nIt starts with an explanation of what are smart contracts (the main purpose of the Ethereum platform) actually good for.\n\n\n  Let’s say that we want to organize a small conference. We need 100 people to sign up and pay/deposit money, so we can rent a hotel and such. But if not enough people sign up by a certain date, then the deposits need to be refunded. With Ethereum, we can write in a JavaScript-like language to code up this contract. It’ll guarantee that everyone will get a ticket to the conference, or everyone will get their money refunded, depending on how many sign up.\n\n\nThe main point is, this whole redistribution of payments that, depending on a condition, might or might not be returned to the people who paid them, is supposed to be made automatic. There is supposed to be no human overseeing it or interpreting the circumstances to help someone in power decide.\n\nThen the DAOs are explained, specifically how you leave a DAO (not just TheDAO but any DAO). The issue here is to leave you need to create your own DAO if you have invested in a project that is still ongoing. Your child DAO will receive the payout of your investment once the project is over.\n\n\n  When you want to leave the fund, you split from it. This includes your share of unspent Ethereum coins, but also tokens representing returns on investments you were part of, but which haven’t yet paid out. That’s why you “split” rather than “cash out”, you need your own DAO shard to track those investments until they pay out.\n\n\nThis DAO splitting is exactly where the hack occured\n\n\n  When a member exits the investment scheme, they call the function name splitDAO(). (…) The member will supply some of their own code with the transaction. Among the things that code will do is tell the DAO code how to transfer Ethereum coin. (…) [Another] issue is that Ethereum code is recursive. That means when a function is running, it may call itself a second time. The bug is that when splitDAO() is called, it will then call the recipients code to transfer Ethereum coin, after which the recipients code will call splitDAO() again before finishing. This causes the process to repeat itself, transferring more Ethereum coin, then calling splitDAO() again, which calls the hacker’s code, which calls splitDAO(), which calls the hacker’s code, and so on. The process will continue endlessly, until it drains all of TheDAO’s coin.\n\n\n\n  Ethereum/TheDAO hack simplified, erratasec.com\n\n\nYou can see that the bug is inherent to DAO codebase and closely related to how Ethereum platform works. If this very basic code is not altered, all future DAOs are subject to this bug.\n\nStolen money recovery\n\nThe only way to undo this is to rewind the blockchain to the state before the attack occured which has been seriously considered and which spooked all the non-ETH fanbois. It would undo not only the hack but also all the other transactions that occured in the meantime which means screwing over the few for the sake of an organization that is too big to fail, as the ErrataSec article points out. We know that from centralized banking.\n\n\n  Why the Wrong Response to The DAO Attack Could Kill Ethereum, coindesk.com\n\n\nCurrently the ongoing solution to this issue implemented by the developers was one that avoids the rewind: New child whitehat DAO attacks were created with the purpose to attack the malicious DAO. The whitehad DAOs rolled out on the 21st of June while developers kept reassuring everybody the attacker cannot access the stolen funds for 27 days which is enough time to come up with a solution.\n\n\n  Ethereum Developers Launch White Hat Counter-Attack on The DAO, coindesk.com\n\n\nThis attempt to shake off the hacker failed.

      title: "Multiple time frame analysis: Trading several timeframes at the same time",
      content: "There are two parts to trading multiple timeframes.\n\nFirst part is the multiple time frame analysis: Unless the only thing you do is scalping on a single market, you should not disregard other timeframes than the one that you are trading. If you are building a mid- to long-term position, you are naturally following the 4H or 1D more. But as you are entering a position, mainly if it is a leveraged one, you will find the high timeframes don’t work very well for picking an entry. With leverage and stop orders, you will rob yourself of a decent chunk of profit if you don’t take a look at 30M, 15M and 5M before entering and just smash that market order button on a whim.\n\nThe other part is position management trading. It is a whole separate art of managing multiple open positions. One thing you absolutely one hundred percent need in this is a stop loss. Ideally a trailing stop: an order that will close your losing trade or lock in profit in your winning trade when the market moves against you by a set amount.\n\nAdvantages of trading over multiple timeframes\n\nThe multiple time frame trading strategy surely looks like it is just something that requires more patience and discipline than buying and hoping for the best in the ever-bullish™ cryptocurrency market of your choice. While this itself is productive – because if you are not disciplined yet, the regular practice of it with the risk of losing money will reinforce the discipline quickly – there’s of course more to it.\n\n\n  The problem here is that computers will always be better and faster at executing algos, so the edge you are able to gain out of this approach is limited.\n\n\nThe futile approach of trying to think like a computer\n\nAs anyone who has ever looked at data as basic as crypto traders’ user handles will confirm: traders are superstitious. They will often tweak their usernames to contain words like ‘moon’ or ‘ace’ or ‘win’ and the like in them. Magical thinking is funny for sure but the deeper point in this is not unreasonable: psychology plays a big role in trading and good part of it reacts on symbols, fast-thinking associations and biases.\n\nMany traders are actively working to clean their minds of biases, believing this kind of purer thinking will make their predictions better. The goal of many crypto traders is to remove the emotions from their trading and to simply execute an algo. The problem here is of course that computers will always be better and faster at this, so the edge you are able to gain out of this approach is limited.\n\nThere is another crop of traders, though. The ones who don’t really fuss about being right. If you are able to get out of a losing trade to live for another day, it won’t hurt you to be wrong even if it happens often – as long as the loss is small. A big advantage of this approach is that it is flexible and allows you to work with the flaws of human mind instead of trying to eliminate them. When you make a mistake, the only thing it means is yah it happens. It does not mean you need to stay out of the market because there is something fundamentally wrong with your way of thinking that would need to be set straight before you make a trade again. If you are staying out of the market it is because you are not seeing an opportunity: you cannot read the current situation to take part in it but chances are, in a few hours or perhaps in another market, you will find an opportunity.\n\nTraders who are down with being wrong are free to work with their own psychology (and also to explore the group psychology of the markets as a whole but that’s for another article). Working with one’s own psychology does not mean emotional trading – it means recognizing that emotions, irrationality and also things one cannot control influence everyone’s decisions whether they like it or not and also no matter whether they are even aware of it. Seemingly unimportant little things can snowball immensely, just as one can compound trading mistakes quickly by (ironically) trying to avoid them.\n\nThe hack to manage multiple positions\n\nHow does this relate to trading multiple timeframes at the same time?\n\nSome futures platforms like OKEx will let you have a long position and a short position opened at the same market. The common practice is that two positions like this will cancel each other (you open a short to close a currently active long position). OKEx however let’s people build a long term position while also capitalizing on short term retracements without needing to close the long term thing. So, you can buy a local bottom and let your winning long ride perhaps even for a few months to the maturity of the contract, if we’re talking about futures, but you can also profit from shorting the top of each leg to the bottom of each retracement that consitutes a continuation.\n\nThat’s possible on OKEx futures (BTC, BCH, ETH and ETC derivatives). Bitfinex has BTC and USD markets that you can use for this purpose since they don’t allow opposite positions on the same market. It is fun to do this and it keeps you on the same page with the market – oftentimes, from watching the ticker only you don’t really get the information about the strength of the demand or the first signs of emerging supply. Trading multiple timeframes makes you listen to the market, not to Reddit shills or your emotions.\n\nHowever, one of the most common problems traders face is how easy it is to spread oneself too thin. Badly managed position is what makes the losses, not necessarily “being wrong”. Trading too many markets and multiple timeframes on top of that sounds like a lot of things to watch but what you notice when you are at it though is the fact that you have multiple positions open is not itself so tiring. It is the compulsion to keep checking everything that breaks down your focus. You go check your short term trade and when you’re at it you also check the long term position, even though it has a trailing stop. Something in the sidebar catches your attention in the meantime, perhaps you should also check the funding rates — and so it goes.\n\nOpen multiple accounts – it is allowed\n\nIf you find this difficult, the easiest thing to do is simply to have multiple accounts.\n\nSome crypto exchanges do allow multiple accounts as long as you are doing that for personal position management and not to rig the markets – you will be OK on Bitfinex, BitMex and Poloniex with multiple accounts.\n\n\n  Poloniex offers a tool to link your accounts together.\n  BitMex rep on Reddit said earlier this year you should let support know you have multiple accounts.\n  Bitfinex can in some cases detect it and allows it unless you are using it to game the market like with the self-funding before the Bcash fork.\n\n\nTo make managing your trades easier, simply have one account for your long term position and one account for short term trades. Set a stop-loss for your long term position and get busy watching your short term positions.\n\nSeparate accounts for different position sizing\n\nThere are also traders who only make a couple of trades a year and in between them don’t even bother watching the charts. When they are getting back into the game, they feel like they need to start small and see what’s going down on the market first.\n\nSome of these traders like to have a separate account for testing the waters and getting back into trading. They will only trade lunch money on that account and once they feel they understand the current market dynamic and see a good opportunity, they return to their normal trading account, deposit their trading stash, make the trade, withdraw the money and take a break again.\n\nThese are just ideas to consider, maybe you will find it is not for you. I am just listing things I saw traders talk about – you can pick whatever you like or nothing at all. It’s really a matter of personal preference.\n",

      title: "3 Tips: How to vet ICOs and what to watch once you're in",
      content: "In a recent short note on news.bitcoin.com an interesting information appeared - 46% of ICOs from 2017 already failed. There surely are scams and failures but one way to work with token markets is to take the past failure data and draw valuable information from them.\n\nLook at ICOs from 2017 that failed\n\nThe information about failed ICOs is easily accessible. Simply go to tokendata.io and list out all ICOs, current and past. When you then filter the results by status you can get the projects with status of Failed to the top. Brace yourself, there is a lot of them.\n\nNow, there is a way to interpret the information though.\n\n\n  \n\n\nYou see that the first failure right on the top of the list is The Dao. You probably know The Dao had a buggy code which was only discovered once a hacker started draining it. Since then it seems the crypto audience has this kind of PTSD - very little trust in anything called Dao.\n\nWhich is a shame because there are Dao’s such as the MakerDAO that are working on projects that could be very useful for crypto trading: a crypto loan backed stablecoin - fully on blockchain yet still worth 1 USD; that is a token system that doesn’t need to hold fiat collateral in a bank as Tether and when backed by big coins also a token that is less vulnerable to market manipulation than NuBits or other stablecoins that maintain their peg only by manipulating supply/demand.\n\nThe Dai is not perfect, it does fluctuate while it converges, it is an experiment - but in the case of stablecoins it is an experiment working towards something that would be very useful on the cryptocurrency markets, no matter what some think. It would make arbitrage possible even on markets where you cannot get fiat out, there would still be the USD value that everyone is used to but this time only as a convention.\n\nBack to the ICO research: the failure of The Dao should not be interpreted as a dead-on-arrival for all future Dao’s. It was a critical failure but it is not like there wouldn’t be a market or an application for some Dao’s. Some will be nonsense for sure but the key point is not to let the fact that it is a Dao cloud your judgement.\n\nThe three things to look for among failed ICOs:\n\n\n  Nonsense projects, joke projects etc - there is the Doge but chances are not many other joke tokens will follow successfully like this. Joke projects are a NO, unless you have some good PnD plan.\n  People who were behind proven scams and ponzi schemes. A clear NO.\n  Projects that failed and are now being rehashed - look into why it failed, the really bad sign for the idea in general is not a hack but nonexistent market. A failure might have also happened because of poor marketing though, you will need to research and asses properly. Good thing is in 2018 airdrops are the rage a bit more than ICOs, and they are less risky (if you take care of your security) as they don’t require an investment. So for instance there was an ICO for MoonFunding, now labeled failed, a startup marketplace which was not heard of other than at Bitcointalk. Right now we have LEXIT which can be obtained from an airdrop. That is a YES or a NO, depends on the situation.\n\n\nWhat to follow closely when you are already in\n\nIf you have picked a token, participated in an airdrop or ICO, got the token to your ERC20 or other wallet: Do subscribe to CoinMarketCal or a similar tool that collects news about coins being listed to Kucoin or Binance. Binance in particular is important (it used to be Polo back in the day) because it is the most popular trading platform.\n\nUpon listing there the brand new market usually experiences such an influx of people that the token price typically shoots up right on the launch.\n\nIt depends on the particular token but very often this surge is short-lived. To put it in a straightforward way, the initial listing pump is not the time to FOMO and increase your position in the hopes for lambo. On the contrary, the proper liquid market is just being formed, it is a better strategy to set some high sells instead.\n\nEven if you believe in your token, don’t let this philosophy put you off: you can always buy back.\n",

      title: "Fulcrum Bottom",
      content: "\n  Fulcrum bottom has been talked about a lot lately in bitcoin trading communities thanks to Peter Brandt mentioning this concept in his reports.\n\n\nDescribing Fulcrum bottom as head &amp; shoulders except at the bottom is not quite cutting it though.\n\nWhat Is Fulcrum\n\nFirst off, here’s a helpful schema in case English is not your first language and fulcrum to you sounded like some guy’s name:\n\n\n\n\nFulcrum is the supporting part of a lever.\n\nThe meaning of it when it comes to chart patterns signifies the mechanistic effect that builds up a good level for potential abrupt breakout.\n\nThe structure of the pattern is also somewhat similar to the shape of a simple lever: Fulcrum bottom occurs in a flat consolidation area after a prolonged downtrend with a strong rally in the middle. This rally fails and is followed by one or more weaker rallies before the final breakout of the range, which makes for the comparison with a head and shoulders formation.\n\nCalling it head and shoulders is therefore too simplistic. Fulcrum is far more complex and it is necessary to pay attention to details.\n\nFulcrum bottom definition\n\nWhat is Fulcrum bottom and how to identify it on the chart:\n\n\n  Fulcrum bottom is a well-defined “congestion area” (consolidation range) after a downtrend.\n  The range is formed by repeated tests of the range boundaries, flat sideways activity near the bottom end at the beginning and the end of the pattern.\n  There are several intermittent rallies that keep failing without breaking the support, one stronger but short-lived rally in the middle of the range that can easily be mistaken for the beginning of an uptrend.\n  The Fulcrum bottom pattern is completed after a breakout over the top of the range.\n\n\nAdapted from “The Acquired Skill of Trading” by William Ballough.\n\nHow to trade Fulcrum bottom\n\nAccording to Ballough there is no harm in treating Fulcrum bottom like a triangle and trading it like a triangle pattern, but you should be more diligent about reversal confirmations.\n\nIt is a long tight range with a lot of sideways and many promising rallies that fail abruptly, if you jump on trades quickly you will be burned often.\n\nOn top of that, being a bottom range the volume is lower due to market psychology which makes it easier to stop-hunt.\n\nBallough gives three helpful hints:\n\n\n  Check if underlying trend is turning positive (MACD, OBV, BBtrend)\n  Look for bullish divergences on higher timeframes (RSI, MACD)\n  Study the slope of moving averages (he uses 50 MA, Bollinger bands would also be helpful with this)\n\n\nThe last point is particularly important in the final stages of the Fulcrum bottom when there will be several smaller failing rallies. Ballough shows the change of the slope of a slow MA can give a hint whether a particular small rally has the potential to be the start of the larger move or whether there is not yet enough strength built up.\n\nYou could also use Bollinger bands - the middle band is a moving average and you will get the additional information about higher lows in relation to the lower band which would be bullish.\n\nAccording to Ballough’s description, in the final rally that will be the start of the markup we should see a bullish divergence, a break through OBV resistance and a slow MA turning slope from slightly negative to slightly positive.\n\nTake a look at the example chart in Figure 3.10 in “The Acquired Skill of Trading” by William Ballough and compare it with BTCUSD 1D retrieved on 25 Sep 2018:\n\n\n\n\nIf this will turn out to be Fulcrum bottom, note that the divergences are there but OBV is not lifting off, nor is the market ranging above the resistance line from 10k USD.\n\nOpinions are welcome in the comments below.\n\nThe chart above was created with TradingView.

      title: "Thoughts on Reversals and Psychology",
      content: "The previous altcoin trading strategy post was on Fulcrum Bottom - a technical chart pattern.\n\nBut there is a lot more to say to reversals in general, not only to bottoming processes.\n\nThe nature of market reversals\n\nMarket reversals are by nature psychologically difficult for traders: Something quite fundamental for speculation and future expectations on the market are changing. Because of this aspect, a market reversal cannot be reduced to a purely technical event. You can certainly trade it that way, but you may miss important information that could be valuable for your other trading decisions.\n\nJohn Bollinger’s focus on three pushes to a high is related to this understanding: It was observed that the decisions of people who bet on an uptrend to go on forever typically prints on the chart as three pushes followed by the fall.\n\nThree pushes…and then?\n\nThat is not where it ends though: One can always hold on to the belief that the old times are coming back soon anyway. When a lot of traders come to think so, the reversing process can drag on for years. In the end, the same majority will flip to the opposing side and maybe cause similar drag during the opposite reversal.\n\nThe problem with this is the growing frustration in the community and the doubt regarding fundamentals of the market even though they are not related to this problem at all.\n\nSo, even if you won’t carry on to study market reversal patterns and making an epic discovery there, at the very least it is important to realize that the struggle with people’s expectations is not an unusual thing. Also, it is probably quite nice to have something clever to respond to other people’s “I told you crypto is a scam”.\n\nThe power of expectations\n\nTo illustrate the power of expectations, I am leaving here the following excerpt from a text about inflation. It is unrelated to cryptocurrency, but it shows the point very well.\n\n\n  The (shortened) excerpt below comes from the book “The Mystery of Banking” by Murray Rothbard. PDF and other formats of it are available for free at mises.org.\n\n\n“During the 1920s, Ludwig von Mises outlined a typical inflation process from his analysis of the hyperinflation in Germany in 1923 — the first runaway inflation in an industrialized country.\n\nThe German inflation had begun during World War I, when the Germans, like most of the warring nations, inflated their money supply to pay for the war.\n\nThe money supply in the warring countries would double or triple. But in what Mises saw to be Phase I of a typical inflation, prices did not rise proportionately to the money supply.\n\nIf M in a country triples, why would prices go up by much less? Because of the psychology of the average German, who thought to himself as follows: ‘I know that prices are much higher now than they were in the good old days before 1914. But that’s because of wartime, and because all goods are scarce due to diversion of resources to the war effort. When the war is over, things will get back to normal, and prices will fall back to 1914 levels.’\n\nIn other words, the German public originally had strong deflationary expectations and the Germans’ demand for money rose.\n\nUnfortunately, the relatively small price rise often acts as heady wine to government. Suddenly, the government officials see a new magic elixir. They can increase the money supply to a fare-thee-well and prices will rise only by a little bit!\n\nBut let the process continue for a length of time, and the public’s response will change - gradually, but inevitably.\n\nIn Germany, after the war was over, prices still kept rising; and then the postwar years went by, and inflation continued in force.\n\nSlowly, but surely, the public began to realize: ‘We have been waiting for a return to the good old days and a fall of prices back to 1914. But prices have been steadily increasing. So it looks as if there will be no return to the good old days. Prices will not fall; in fact, they will probably keep going up.’\n\nAs this psychology takes hold, the public’s thinking in Phase I changes into that of Phase II: ‘Prices will keep going up, instead of going down. Therefore, I know in my heart that prices will be higher next year.’\n\nThe public’s deflationary expectations have been superseded by inflationary ones. Rather than hold on to its money to wait for price declines, the public will spend its money faster, will draw down cash balances to make purchases ahead of price increases.\n\nIn Phase II of inflation, instead of a rising demand for money moderating price increases, a falling demand for money will intensify the inflation.\n\nThere is no scientific way to predict at what point in the expectations will reverse. The answer will differ from one country to another, and from one epoch to another, and will depend on many subtle cultural factors, such as trust in government, speed of communication, and many others.”\n\n\n\nIf you are looking for a reliable web charts for crypto, try and make a free TradingView account here.\n",

      title: "Crypto Investment Strategy: Step By Step Guide to Long-Term Holding",
      content: "As the anonymous internet hive of crypto investors likes to put it, typically it is wiser to be the 0.01% of world’s population that own cryptocurrencies rather than trying to be the top 1% of traders who actually win at the markets.\n\nIn fact, a buy and hold strategy is much easier to grasp than any part of the quant craft or even some of the technical analysis wizardry.\n\nNevertheless, a plan that sounds straightforward on the paper does not make you immune to panic, FOMO, fear and straight up bad decisions that you take in the spur of the moment.\n\nIn markets as new and disruptive as cryptocurrencies are, you can be sure the emotional play will makes an appearance sooner or later. It will have you sit with your finger on your cold storage, in a state of mind not fit to make good and reasonable decisions.\n\n\n  There are altcoin trading strategies and there are “hodl” strategies\n\n\nAs we’ve outlined in this 101 on altcoin trading strategies, you will benefit from having at least rudiments of strategic steps to take in your mind, and that is even if you just plan to hold for the long run.\n\nInvestment is in fact a trade as well:\n\n\n  Investment starts when you enter the market.\n  It continues while you hold your cryptoasset.\n  It ends when you sell your cryptoasset.\n\n\nFor a good crypto investor, none of these actions are arbitrary.\n\nA clear investment strategy will prepare you in advance for any potential drawdowns - the periods of time when the value of your investment will be less than what you initially invested. If executed correctly, it will help you avoid mistakes like selling your crypto stash out of fear it will go to zero.\n\nLet’s take a look at what all comes into play when you want to buy and hold a cryptocurrency the right way.\n\n1. Enter the crypto market\n\nThis is not a stock picking blog, so let’s say you’ve done your homework and found a cryptoasset you think has great potential. You want to hold it for the long run.\n\nWhat’s a “long run” though?\n\nMake it specific: Is that 6 months to you? Two years? Ten years? You will need to have some time horizon in mind. Only then you can divide that time period into smaller slices - typically a quarter, or a month.\n\nAt the end of each period, take a bit more time for a market research. Then sit down and reevaluate your investment with a clear head and up-to-date market information.\n\nOnce you have your time horizon, you can start actually worrying about buying crypto: How do you pick the time to enter the market?\n\nLong-Term Holders Benefit from DCA Strategy\n\nIf you want to be a long-term crypto holder with no interest in trading, dollar cost averaging, or DCA, will work to your advantage.\n\nDCA strategy works by removing the problem of timing your crypto market entry.\n\n\n  You will spend no extra time learning about the irrational market actions.\n  You will most likely buy just before a dump at some point, but it will be a small amount. In effect, it will psychologically prepare you for the swings on cryptocurrency markets which would otherwise be quite stressful.\n\n\nHere is a super quick rundown of what you need to do.\n\n\n  Decide on an amount to set aside a small amount from each of your paychecks. It should be quite a small amount, really only so much you can miss every month.\n  Get verified on a cryptocurrency exchange with a fiat onramp. If you’re concerned, use p2p markets like LocalEthereum (LocalBitcoins has some warning signs as of late).\n  If you can ship fiat to the exchange without submitting a request each time, set up a permanent order from your bank account. This way you won’t waver.\n  As soon as the money arrives to your exchange account, buy as much crypto as you can for that amount. On bigger exchanges, this can also be automated.\n\n\nIf you find yourself worried and tempted to check the price around your DCA purchase, lower the amount you’re sending in. The point of DCA strategy is you don’t think about your buying activity at all.\n\nActual Entry Timing Strategies for Crypto?\n\nDCA works very well on the long term horizons. After all, we have seen that with ETH, with BTC or with XRP: Surely Ripple investors who were cashing out at the 3 USD level were not sorry if they had entered the market at 0.45 USD instead of at the 0.35 USD level.\n\nIf you only want to hold a cryptocurrency for a season, that’s already a call that ventures more into swing trading.\n\nPicking a right entry for shorter runs is a theme for a strategy article in itself. It will need some chart reading skills and a look at the state of the markets as well as on the type of the cryptoasset you’re interested in.\n\n\n  An established cryptocurrency tends to form ranges. They can signal a top, but unless there’s been a prolonged bull market for a good while, typically a range will be a good place to enter.\n  A small-cap altcoin usually runs up on extremely good news, a rumour or a speculation. In this case there will be no range to start with.\n  Altcoins that have PoW halving events, notably Litecoin, have predictable patterns around these events.\n\n\nIf you are looking for a reliable crypto charting app, go try a free TradingView account.\n\n2. Get a Crypto Storage or Income from Interest\n\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies doesn’t end when you press the ‘buy’ button. More specifically, since with blockchain you are your own bank, investing in cryptocurrencies never ends with simply buying the digital asset and leaving it on the exchange.\n\nIf you think of digital asset exchanges as banks, in probably less than a year you will have learned a very expensive lesson.\n\nYour Personal Crypto Custody\n\nFirst thing to take care of after investing in crypto is the custody of your asset: Where are you planning to store it?\n\nA cryptoasset trading platform can of course hold your assets, but will not be insured for the events of hacking. And boy, do the hacks happen.\n\nWhile it is the truth that poorly managed individual cryptocurrency storage can be hacked too, exchanges and web-hosted crypto wallets are a more valuable target for the attacker, because there is far more money concentrated in them.\n\nThe only case where it is reasonable to leave a digital asset on an exchange is when you take part in p2p lending.\n\nLending Cryptocurrencies through a Trading Platform\n\nOn some crypto trading platforms, notably Bitfinex and Bitmex, you may choose to provide your coins to margin traders in exchange for interest. Be aware that the interest rates for altcoins are typically very modest though.\n\nA meagre interest rate is not better than nothing: You should not see lending as a risk-free way to earn passive income.\n\n\n  You are leaving your cryptoasset on a third-party platform.\n  The security of your money there is out of your control.\n  Since 2016, there have been several high-profile digital exchange hacks every year.\n\n\nBecause of the threat of hacking, cryptocurrency lending is really just another form of investment. As such, lending requires a strategy.\n\nThe first question to ask yourself when you think about lending out your cryptocurrency is simply, is the interest high enough to justify the risk of leaving the cryptocurrency stash on an exchange?\n\nThere is a formula for the calculation of the crypto lending profits that can be found in our crypto lending strategy article; it is basically a calculation of profits earned from compound interest over 365 days.\n\nIf you run the calculation, you will find that a daily interest rate of 0.01% will only earn you some six to seven hundred dollars per year if you start with twenty thousand dollars worth. That’s six hundred for twenty thousand left at risk through the whole year!\n\n\n  \n    \n      P\n      $20,000\n      $20,000\n      $20,000\n      $20,000\n      $20,000\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      r\n      1.0001\n      1.00015\n      1.0003\n      1.001\n      1.002\n    \n    \n      A\n      $20,743\n      $21,125\n      $22,314\n      $28,805\n      $41,471\n    \n    \n      B\n      $632\n      $957\n      $1,967\n      $7,484\n      $18,251\n    \n    \n      C\n      3%\n      5%\n      10%\n      37%\n      91%\n    \n  \n\n\nA ... end amount before fees\nB ... cash profit after fees\nC ... percent return after fees\n\nprincipal $20,000\nn = 365 days\ndaily rates: 0.01%, 0.015%, 0.03%, 0.1%, 0.2%\n\n\nOnce again, even when it comes to anything perceived as risk-free income generation, be sure you are making an informed decision.\n\nYou can always decide to lend a small part of your crypto stash, or to lend only when the rates are good – just as a good crypto trader would not trade when he doesn’t see a good opportunity for a trade.\n\nYour Cryptocurrency Cold Storage Options\n\nHolding your crypto in a carefully maintained wallet is the safest option to keep your investment secure.\n\nIt is never completely safe:\n\n\n  One option is to homelab your own cold storage, which is risky and requires expertise.\n  Another option is to go with commercial hardware wallets which are a black box and provably have vulnerabilities.\n  Any piece of hardware can have a backdoor that passes unnoticed for years.\n\n\nIn other words, there is always a risk. Therefore it is not such a bad idea to divide your holdings into multiple places, if it’s a significant amount.\n\n\n  If you trade or lend some part of your holdings and need to make transactions often, you can opt for a web-wallet. This is a wallet solution hosted on a web server, the least secure solution of them all. A reasonable secure and time proven wallet is the blockchain.com one.\n  Mobile wallets are generally more secure than web wallets. At the same time they are easy to enough use on the daily, and as they are on your phone, it is easy to keep them updated.\n  Hardware wallets are the most secure option to hold cryptocurrencies that is at the same time also practical for the occasions you want to make a transaction. The Ledger wallet products are currently leading the market.\n  Paper wallet is the oldest and least hackable type of cold storage. It is literally a physical piece of paper, which makes it immune to most threats other than physical rot or similar damage, but it is not practical to use them for regular transactions.\n\n\n3. Maintenance Work: Stay Informed and Reevaluate\n\nOnce you have your crypto custody sorted, you can embark on the maintenance work that a good cryptocurrency investment requires.\n\nAs an investor, you should stay on top of the news about cryptocurrencies you have put your money in, as well as about the altcoin markets in general: When it comes to price valuations during a bull run, it might be the case that there is a huge gap between the leader and the second place. But overall, the market moves as a whole. If there is a single cryptocurrency shooting up to the moon but there is no other coin joining in running up for a few days, it will have been a short-term occurrence rather than a multiyear bull market.\n\nMore on intermarket analysis can be found within the market timing strategy article. To give you the gist, it will be enough to say that monitoring news about both bitcoin and altcoin markets is vital.\n\nUnless you are a trading prodigy though, it will be a far healthier approach to not act on every gossip.\n\n\n  Set aside a certain amount of time each week to go through the official subreddits, where the important news get posted.\n  Subscribe to Google alerts for any personality names, businesses or technology terms that are relevant to your investment. You don’t actually need to click these, just get them weekly and skim the headlines.\n  Set up blockchain as your interest in Google News, this will put the headlines from Coindesk and other big outlets on your home tab.\n\n\nStay informed, but always strive to make decisions with a cool head.\n\nWhat to focus on when skimming the news headlines\n\nReserving your attention for the news that actually should have consequence for your decisions will need a fair portion of judgement.\n\nIt is safe to say that any scaremongering, appeals to emotions and sensational news can usually be safely ignored. If you are investing for a shorter term or if you want to trade, it might work for you to ride a wave of speculation.\n\nIn this case, an honest look at what your cryptocurrency is offering will be needed:\n\n\n  Monero or Bitcoin are examples of cryptocurrencies that get practically used by the public as well as businesses and investors. Regulatory news can spur a speculation, but P2P volumes or network and mining data can serve as fundamentals.\n  Ethereum is a platform for development of decentralized applications, which itself is a very practical use case. However, nearly all of its dApps other than blockchain games are built as speculatory proof-of-concepts.\n  Cryptocurrencies like Ripple or EOS are designed to serve business needs. Even if the actual digital asset is not equivalent to a company stock, as long as they are in an experimental stage, the strategy and actions of the business that develops the asset is what matters.\n  Other tokens and small-cap altcoins are projects that promise all sorts of things and that’s about it really. Some of them might become hugely successful in the future, some of them will fail, some will stick around for years in a sort of middle-class.\n\n\n\n\nCase in Point: Investing in Ripple\n\nRipple is one of the top cryptocurrencies designed as a medium for cross-border payments.\n\nThe end game of Ripple is rather ambitious. If the vision on the Ripple fintech comes true, you should be able to facilitate a cross-border money transfer from one bank to another through the Ripple network.\n\nAn international wire transfer would cost next to nothing, complete almost instantly and you would not really notice any difference - the whole process would execute in the background.\n\nThe issue is that for this vision to come true, Ripple Labs, the creator of Ripple, would need to convince at least several major banking institutions to partner with this cryptocurrency fintech startup and implement their solution.\n\nAt the same time, as soon as a couple of banks would budge, being on the Ripple network would become a strong competitive advantage. Customers would gravitate towards the member institutions, eventually even the most conservative banks would be pushed to adopt a distributed ledger backend.\n\nIt is true that Ripple has managed to secure some high-profile partnerships: Moneygram, Americal Express, Accenture, Santander. But it is also true that the value proposition of Ripple is still very rich on “maybe, one day, if”.\n\nXRP vs Ripple\n\nIn the crypto trading circles, Ripple is commonly used to describe the popular digital asset. That is not quite correct.\n\n\n  Ripple, or Ripple Labs, is a US-based fintech company that aims at disrupting the cross-border payment system that is currently ruled mainly by the VISA and MasterCard giants.\n  The asset that can be invested in is in fact called XRP and it is independent on Ripple Labs.\n\n\nXRP is a digital asset that lives on the Ripple network, but as an asset it is independent.\n\nKind of.\n\nRipple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse puts it this way: If the Ripple company disappeared today, XRP would continue to function. That to me shows the asset is in fact decentralized.\n\nEven though this fact supports a good degree of decentralization in the Ripple network, it is no secret that the value proposition of Ripple still relies very much on business-to-business relationships.\n\nYou will see that as a crypto investor, it will be important to take the current business agenda of Ripple Labs into account before you make a decision for your next move on the XRP markets.\n\nIn case you see yourself as more of a long-term XRP holder, it will be less crucial what Ripple Labs are doing at the moment.\n\nTheir longer term business direction will still matter, though.\n\nPRO TIP: One good tip is to watch how a business reacts when a direct competitor emerges. After all, market competition is natural and can serve very well to push an emerging industry leader to faster and better innovation.\n\n\n\nPlan the reevaluation of your cryptoasset portfolio\n\nReevaluation sessions are an important part of the maintenance work on your investment. They are exactly the moments where you decide what to do next.\n\nIt’s key to be regular about reevaluating:\n\n\n  Looking at the actual numbers will help you stay real and ultimately make good decisions. This is about money, not about feels.\n  If you plan these sessions ahead, as a part of your crypto investment strategy, chances are you will not be swayed by abrupt market movements.\n\n\nNotice that goals of the likes as “I want to double my initial” have not been mentioned once in this article. You don’t need those - obviously you want to make money, but how much an asset will grow is not really your decision, is it? Instead of declaring it as a price target, make yourself prepared for the alternative that your money does actually double, and plan ahead for what to do once it happens before it happens.\n\nReevaluation is simply taking a look at the state of your asset’s market as well as crypto markets in general, at the major news that happened since your last reevaluation, and at the fiat value of your stash.\n\nThe only tools you really need is Reddit for the news and a portfolio tracking app like Blockfolio for fiat values. If you want to take into account money and investments you have outside of crypto, you will need a spreadsheet to calculate the total worth of your portfolio and the value distributed between individual assets.\n\nGet this ready for each of your reevaluating sessions and answer the questions below:\n\n\n  Does it still have value to keep holding the asset? Did the value of your investment grow so much that it becomes too risky to still have that much value tied in that asset? Did you find other investment opportunity where you could use the money better?\n  Do you believe the asset you’re holding is still undervalued? Would it have value to invest more money into it?\n  Do you think it is time to take some profits or to cut the loss? Do you exit fully? Do you take out the initial investment? Are you planning to buy back?\n\n\nIt’s really simple as that.\n\nRemember that reevaluation should happen regularly, even if you’re underwater. If you are planning to hold a cryptocurrency for a year or more, a good interval is to reevaluate every three months.\n\n4. Market Exit: Selling Your Stash or Rebalancing?\n\nValuations of cryptocurrencies swing a lot. What was initially a small investment might suddenly become 90% of your total net worth. Are you still happy to have this large a portion of your portfolio invested into a single asset? If not, you can opt for rebalancing.\n\n\n  Rebalancing does not mean to even out the value distribution between your assets, it is rather changing the distribution to fit better your risk preference.\n  As the crypto landscape changes, your target balance between assets may change.\n  You can do calendar rebalancing, each time to reevaluate your investment. You can also rebalance with abrupt market movements.\n\n\nAt some point, the result of your reevaluation session will be selling all of your holdings and exiting the market.\nYour final decision should take into account several diverse aspects, and often it is not an easy call. Your risk appetite also comes into play here, and so does the timeframe of your investment.\n\n\n  There are investors who take some profits each time the price action of their cryptoasset shoots up in a very short period of time. They might buy back later, but other than that they just leave their invested money intact for five to ten years.\nS* ome long-term investors do not touch their cryptoasset holdings at all and are not set off when their investment goes through drawdowns. The philosophy behind it is that in some ten years, they will either have fat savings ready or the value of their asset will be so negligible they might as well forget about it.\n\n\nSummary\n\nIn this article be have covered all the vital parts of a good cryptocurrency investment strategy, with an illustration of investing in XRP.\n\nOnce you have your mind set on an asset, a good crypto investment strategy starts with picking its time horizon, continues by staying informed while your asset is either safely stored or earns interest and ends with your informed decision to sell - fully or partially.\n",

      title: "Technical Analysis in Crypto: How to use TA strategically",
      content: "Be it in crypto or legacy markets, technical analysis is something that people typically either hate or rely on blindly and religiously.\n\nIn a 2019 blog post on whether technical analysis in crypto actually works, we’ve talked about how knowing your patterns can give you better odds in trading.\n\nWe also acknowledged the limitations: “If there is an unexpected important event happening, it will always shake up the markets, no matter how mature and stable they are: China bans Bitcoin? Of course. How about China banning the US Dollar, though? Of course there would be a shake-up too!”\n\nEven if the 2008 crisis is long forgotten now, in the light of the COVID-19 outbreak the limitation of “history rhymes” tactic of using technical analysis is probably more than clear.\n\nThat is only the most basic idea of how to use TA, though. It is also not a reason to ditch TA completely.\n\nThe best way to explain why will be to list the most common misuses and misconceptions about technical analysis.\n\nTechnical analysis should not generate illusion of complexity\n\n\n\nLeave that for the Twitter gurus who keep their followers busy and engaged with the help of fuckarounditis.\n\nThe best yardstick is to see if your technical analysis is helping you make a decision.\n\nIf it isn’t doing that, you’re doing it wrong. No matter if you are using the “right” indicators and ALL the lines. (Ignore the reverse statement though. If your TA helps you make a decision, you can still be botching it.)\n\nA sound trading decision should always be right there at the end of your analysis. If you’re leaving your chart confused, stop doing whatever you’re doing.\n\nTechnical analysis is not the source of truth\n\nKeeping the same idea as with the last point, let’s reiterate that technical analysis is not the source of truth. This is a subtle thing that will royally screw you in the long run.\n\nIt is also one of the most common misconceptions you see among traders on social networks on forums.\n\nChart patterns and technical indicator values are not showing the truth about the market.\n\n\n  \n    If you are a short time-frame trader, they point at regularities that may be happening on the market and the details of which are probably unknown to you. They are also not all that important as long as you are picky enough about which assets you trade.\n  \n  \n    For the long-term decisions, you get a bird’s-eye view of the market. You can see some vague tendencies and trends, and you definitely can see if it the activity is healthy hustle and bustle or ill-looking convolutions and tremor.\n  \n\n\nIf you look at a chart and see “inverse head and shoulders, therefore I should open a 20x long”, go look at something else.\n\nTechnical analysis is not a formula to apply without any other considerations. Even trading bots need to be trained and backtested for specific market conditions.\n\nTechnical analysis is not faultless\n\nThis has been said before, and it is important enough to be repeated: Technical analysis works on the basis of probability.\n\nSometimes, market in a vulnerable condition will be exploited to oblivion, sometimes it will be left unnotices because there are better opportunities elsewhere. There may be a lot of money on the sidelines waiting for that subtle sign of strength but there may not. There also may be money on the sidelines looking for a market to invest in and eventually not finding anything better than crypto, and thereby generating a sign of strength.\n\n\n  You see a bullish divergence? There is an emerging strength in the market, but it is still very easy to kill this strength.\n  You see a resistance broken through on good volume, already after a throwback? That’s a sign of strength that is significantly harder to kill.\n\n\nBut remember, that everything on the market is a negotiation. There is always variance. You will be wrong sometimes.\n\nSo, what gives?\n\nTechnical analysis is just a tool\n\n\n\nWith all that said, it boils down to the same thing: Technical analysis is just a tool.\n\nIdeally, you will get comfortable with using technical analysis to such an extent that it will help you make a value judgement.\n\nTo use technical analysis as a framework for value judgement, you will find it matters less which exact indicators you use. Obviously some tools are more suitable to use on longer trades and others for scalping. But in general, the idea is to stick to a toolbox with which you are comfortable.\n\nYou should roughly understand what your tools are doing. That does not mean you have to know the mathematical formula, practical understanding is enough.\n\nYou have practical understanding of an indicators if you know what kind of information it brings out in the chart.\n\nIf you want an example, read the Glossary entry for the Bart formation.\n\nBest TA tools to facilitate strategic thinking\n\n\n  Comparison with other markets\n\n\nOne of the best ways to “zoom out” properly is to look at other markets than the one you have entered.\n\nBasket Indexes\n\nThe most obvious advantage is to look at other markets in the same industry. If you are trading cryptocurrencies, that would mean looking at other comparable cryptos and possibly a broad cryptocurrency market index. We have touched on this aspect in our Timing Tools strategy post.\n\nDirect comparison of the assets in the same industry tells you which assets are (according to the market participants) the runners and which are the laggards.\n\n\n  \n    The weaker assets might start dropping in value a little sooner while money still keeps flowing into the higher quality assets within and industry. This is the aim of the Advance-Decline Line done on a basket index, which counts how many of the individual made a red day vs how many made a green day. This might show you an industry-wide weakness that is not yet dire enough to influence the strongest assets in the industry. You will have to work out for yourself what that weakness is, though.\n  \n  \n    When it really comes to a broad decline or a bear market all across crypto assets, the laggards will perform the worst. When there is a run up however, in the unregulated crypto markets these assets may actually get a wilder bubble, if their markets are smaller and easier to influence. Here, specifically for crypto, the point is not exactly that you must go and speculate on that, but that you can have your own mind set before you go read crypto forums where maybe Monero is the future, or Litecoin, or ETH, or whatever.\n  \n\n\nAs for long term holding or even dollar-cost averaging (AKA the “extreme long” position), comparing multiple assets within an industry gives you a clear idea of which ones you want to hold and which are at least for now too speculative for that. This is a crypto-specific variation of the concept called Wyckoff avoidance.\n\nWith this Wyckoffian pickiness in mind, there is one more benefit you can get out of checking other markets.\n\nIf you take a look at markets that you are not trading, and not even interested in trading, you will really come to terms with how much your emotions and personal bias influence how you interpret the patterns that you see in the chart.\n\nIt is a very good school to refresh your eye like this every now and then.\n\nEquivalent Assets\n\nPerhaps more interesting than pulling together charts of random altcoins though is to compare your selected crypto to it’s legacy equivalent, and see how each of them performs against some counterpart.\n\nThis comparison of BTC and gold vs the S&amp;P 500 is self-explanatory:\n\n\n\nOne last thing to note is that if you are struggling to find a plottable counterpart for your altcoin, that may be an information itself.\n\nIt is a test of how well actual money backs a narrative: There may be cryptocurrencies and tokens for, say, line shipment industry that have been publicly traded for years now, but if the charts don’t align at all with any data from that actual industry, you know the whole market is pure speculation.\n\nHere again, technical analysis can help as a tool to test the reality.\n\n\n  Divergences\n\n\nDivergences are a great technical tool to figure out whether your market is roughly at the level where you can start looking for your opportunity.\n\nWhat you should really be looking in divergences is a hidden tendency of the market (strength or weakness) that might not be visible from the price action yet. If you spot a divergence, it’s not a good enough reason to open an order. Divergences should really be used only to judge the directional bias that is still in the making and can be easily reverted.\n\nThis makes divs a poor technical indicator in the eyes of too many traders. The reality is though that divergences are a great first-scan tool: You check the market for divergences before you start looking at anything else.\n\n\n  Ichimoku Cloud\n\n\nThe name Ichimoku literally means “single glance”, so you can just re-read the last sentence of what was written about divergences.\n\nIt really depends on your preference here, pick your poison and stick to it. Ichimoku cloud holds more information and can be traded in shorter time spans in some circumstances, but if you like better working with divs maybe because they don’t generate so many weird lines on your chart, then absolutely don’t force yourself into trading the Ichimoku.\n\n\n  Bollinger bands\n\n\nLast but not least, not to discriminate shorter time-frame traders: Bollinger Bands.\n\nBollinger bands are best suited for looking at charts of pairs. BTC/USD is a pair for instance, you are looking at the ratio of two currencies.\n\nThe reason “bbands” are a good tool for ratios is that the outer bands are the standard deviation of a market. In a ratio of two assets, this amounts to showing how is the invested money flowing between them.\n\n\n  You can have a situation where the price action is bouncing within the range of the standard deviation. Such conditions are the most harmonious. There may be a trend or there may be none, maybe there will be a tendency for the price to keep at one side of the bands. Either way, roughly speaking the money just moves back and forth between the two. There are not many surprises.\n  You can have a situation where the price action shoots out of the bound of the standard “fluctuation”, out of the bands, and then promptly shoots back. That was an attempt to change the standard. For this instance it didn’t stick, but you can go on and investigate further.\n  Then you can have a situation where the shooting out of the bands persist for long enough that eventually the shape of the bands will adapt to reflect the new normal.\n\n\nSummary\n\nTLDR; technical analysis is not the source of truth nor the source of evil.\n\nIt is a tool.\n\nYou might find it useful if you find a comfortable toolbox of tools to use as… tools.\n\nYou might find it confusing if you try to apply it without thinking, as a formula.\n",

      title: "Crypto Market Psychology vs *Your* Trading Psychology",
      content: "In this trading strategy post, we are going to look into the topic of crypto market psychology.\n\nWe will approach it from two points of view. First one will be the bird’s eye view (the aggregate market psychology) and then the individual view (the trading psychology).\n\nPsychology of Market vs Psychology of Trader\n\nTechnically, these are two different things. The market psychology and a trader’s psychology are related, though.\n\nAs a trader, your mindset and your decision making is part of the market.\n\nThe way you think influences the what you decide to do. That in turn influences the market movements and helps form the aggregate market psychology.\n\nMarket is the aggregate of individuals\n\nWhat traders and researchers alike call crypto market psychology is the prevailing group behaviour that results from actions of individual traders.\n\nYou are probably aware that not all traders on the same market act the same way. If they did, the market would not exist.\n\nMarket is made by exchange of value between buyers and sellers - two parties who act in opposition, or at least with different reasons and on different time scales.\n\nWhatever the details, they are not in agreement.\n\nDifferent goals and reasons, but also no reasons\n\nIt’s not quite right to say that trading is zero sum game in the way that for every profitable trade you made there was a loser on the other side.\n\nThe person on the other side could have been dollar cost averaging. If they were a long-term holder who is not planning to cash out until two years after the next halving, they don’t care if they are buying on a 4H-resistance. You perhaps do care, because you are speculating short term.\n\nIf we only take into account traders with same goal, such as only people who want to make some lunch money in the next few hours, zero sum game becomes a more accurate description.\n\nIn this perspective, your aim is to get your trading psychology slightly ahead of the market psychology. In other words, you do not want to stick with the prevailing opinion just because it exists and is prevailing.\n\nMajority of your peers either don’t know what and why they should do, or they know it and fail to execute it due to their emotions.\n\nCrypto Market Psychology: The Research\n\nThere has been quite a good amount of research done on the psychology of the cryptocurrency markets.\n\nPeople have done sentiment analysis, price bias analysis, the influence of news, correlation with legacy finance and among crypto-assets as well.\n\nA lot has been done in what would have to be called econometrics of cryptocurrencies. This kind of research works with statistics and mathematical modeling to find relationships between the cryptocurrency price and its network activity, Google search volume, trading volume, the number of active addresses in a day and so on.\n\nThese papers are not bad, especially you are setting up your own market monitoring or analysis.[1]\n\nThe situation with market psychology papers is quite different.\n\nOne thing you will notice when you skim through them is that some authors apparently don’t know anything about cryptocurrency markets and probably never lurked in a crypto trading community in their life.[2]\n\nThe result are legacy ideas applied on crypto markets, producing bizarre conclusions.\n\nHow the Market Psychology Gets Mis-Read\n\nOne example to demonstrate why you should not base your decisions on reputable sources of finance news: Nobody in the traditional finance research world seems to be aware of the “alt season”.\n\nMeanwhile, every crypto trader or investors knows that “alt season” is something that exists and influences most of all the day-traders and other short term speculators in crypto.\n\nIf there is an expectation that “alt season” is about to start, traders come pour money into the alt innovation hype of the week, which will make all new alts with even remotely related focus correlated.\n\nIn the world of traditional finance this does not exist.\n\nThere are penny stocks and small cap assets that may be all very much worthless, but each is worthless in its own special way. They do get more volatile than large cap assets but they do not get correlated to one another.\n\nWhich is not unreasonable at all once you realize what are the barriers to creating a company and taking it public, versus the barriers to … launching a token.\n\nNevertheless, researchers will attribute the different behaviour of altcoin markets to cognitive biases of crypto traders.\n\nBy now you probably can imagine how the crypto market psychology must look like in the eyes of a legacy market analyst, and what that means to you.\n\nThe hive and echo-chamber that is the crypto market psychology is not a bad thing. It shows that innovating and pushing new ideas happens with much lower barriers in crypto - at least for now.\n\nSure, most of it will come to waste and maybe the only real consequence for the next few years will be the brand new PR industry springing up around DeFi and initial whatever offerings (someone has to consult, promote and sell all that stuff). But there is still the chance something with real impact will come out of this trash. If nothing else, maybe crypto PR folks could start charging their fees in crypto, just like yours truly AltcoinTrading.NET does it.\n\nIf this description of current and near-future altcoin markets is accurate, it also means they are quite close to the idea of zero sum game: The altcoin environment is better suited for short term speculation, the big cryptos for the mid to long game.\n\nYour Trading Psychology\n\nHere is where your individual psychology comes into play.\n\nTrading psychology is another word for your mindset, the way you seek out information and how you make decisions when you are trading.\n\nInformation Gathering: Use the right sources\n\nWe have gone through the reasons why mainstream finance news cannot be a good source when it comes to crypto markets.\n\nDo not think that less mainstream sources will automatically do it though. Just go to TradingView’s market ideas section and look what is top by user votes under Trading Psychology, or anywhere else for that matter.\n\nYour own research, your own insight and your own look into fundamental tech data will top any reputable mainstream resource in the long run.\n\nYour Mindset: Speaking of TradingView…\n\nTradingView is a great charting platform and all that. There used to be a saying that its built-in chat is great too, after you’ve blocked 98% of the people there.\n\nThere are popular posts on TradingView that recommend to revenge trade, for instance. Don’t go play there, keep your mind clear.\n\nWorking with emotions\n\nAs for decisions, trading is pretty much shopping and the catches there are similar.\n\nTrading on emotions is usually making good money for someone who isn’t you, especially when the emotion is fear.\n\nThis is far from specific to crypto or even trading. Fear is the chief marketing tool in many industries. Healthy food, fitness services and subscriptions, the vast majority of beauty products - all this gets sold on fear.\n\nAnyone who ever witnessed correction of a cryptocurrency market will know that a lot of coin changes hands during those periods, and that it is quite understandable given how shit the market usually looks then.\n\nYou are never going to get rid of your emotions. Good news is that not acting on them is enough. More good news? The only thing it takes is practice.\n\nBe aware of your risks. Calculate them, even if with just ballpark figures. Decide for yourself if the trade has value for you at all.\n\nDon’t want to do that? You can always DCA.\n\nDollar cost averaging works both ways, into crypto and out of it as well. You’ll get through plenty fear-practice on DCA too if you’re new, but the plan will be easier to stick to because it’s just so damn simple. Over time it might become a good habit.\n\nIf you made a mistake, acknowledge it and try to salvage as much as possible. On the market this will translate into cutting your losses short.\n\nRemember the bigger picture\n\nIn crypto markets, traders often marry the idea that the chart is all there is to crypto. Trading is the only thing that keeps cryptocurrencies around, day trading is what does the price discovery, blockchain technology is empty buzzword that has no consequence.\n\nThis is not true.\n\nIt was years after Google became the most used search engine when the search result page first started being used for business. To the OGs, web search was a tool for liberation of knowledge and enhancement of personal freedom.\n\nIt sounds almost funny nowadays: We hit Google the minute we are stuck on the simplest problem because that way we don’t have to think.\n\nThere was a lot of backlash among the OGs when the “evil” business people started littering the search results with things that make money:\n\n\n\nIt is obvious to see which party was on the right side of the history, and how quickly that happened. Within only a few years, a whole industry sprung up around search engine marketing, online publishing and advertising.\n\nOnline ads remained hugely underpriced compared to traditional street adverts long after it became the norm to get people bumping into each other outdoors, due to them staring exclusively into their phones.\n\nThe secondary industry is a part of the crypto market that is not a piece of the zero sum game, and passes mostly disregarded in analyses.\n\nYou need to keep your mind clear and your emotions at bay to see these things.\n\nCouple of Book Recommendations\n\n(Also to be found in ATNET Glossary on Trading Psychology)\n\n\n  Jared Tendler — The Mental Game of Poker\n\n\nDifferent industry, but applies very well to crypto trading.\n\nOne of the key lessons of Tendler’s book is called unconscious competence: You can learn a new skill well, but until it is settled in your mind so well that you aren’t even aware that you were not born with it, then you will not remember to use it in the critical moment when you are under pressure.\n\n\n  Daniel Kahneman — Thinking Fast and Slow\n\n\nThis is a famous one.\n\nYou will learn an awful lot about cognitive biases, quick judgements and all kind of stuff that you would probably want to avoid knowing about because it will make you feel quite dumb.\n\n\n  Michael Mauboussin — More Than You Know\n\n\nThis is another one that became a popular read among poker players.\n\nIt goes through a lot of interesting ideas on what influences your trading and definitely influences the trading of a substantial portion of the crowd.\n\nTake for instance emotions:\n\nMost people will tell you to disregard your emotions when you trade. Sadly, research shows that it’s impossible.\n\nWhat you can do instead is to accept that your emotions will trigger during abrupt price action. Then you can try to anticipate how they could influence your trading in different situations.\n\nWith this worked out, you can then do your best to not act on the emotion when it triggers and instead capitalize on the rest of the crowd where the majority will be acting on the same emotion.\n\nSummary\n\nThe wild swings of crypto markets make for huge psychological pressure in professional traders. Among people who are not used to that, the pressure can become over the top and wreck your judgement.\n\nThe crypto market is not as crazy and biased as the legacy finance sees that. The crypto market psychology is what it is for a reason. If that triggers your emotions, work on your trading psychology.\n\n\n\n[1] “What can explain the price, volatility and trading volume of Bitcoin?”, Finance Research Letters, ISSN: 1544-6123, Vol: 29, Page: 255-265 (2019)\n\nAbstract: We study which variables can explain and predict the return, volatility and trading volume of Bitcoin. The considered variables are return, volatility, trading volume, transaction volume, change in the number of unique Bitcoin addresses, the VIX index and Google searches for “Bitcoin”. We use realized volatility calculated from high-frequency data and find that the heterogeneous autoregressive model is suitable for Bitcoin volatility. Trading volume further improves this volatility model. The trading volume of Bitcoin can be predicted from Google searches for “Bitcoin”. However, none of the considered variables can predict Bitcoin returns.\n\n[2] “The psychology of cryptocurrency prices”, Finance Research Letters, ISSN: 1544-6123, Vol: 33, Page: 101192 (2020)\n",

      title: "Margin Lending Strategy Template (Best for Bitfinex lending)",
      content: "A lot has been written about margin funding. Anything from “hey free moneyh” to country-specific tax problems.\n\nSome crypto traders like to lend their coins when they aren’t trading them (and also when they want to make themselves stop trading), some (a minority) prefer to withdraw their coins to a wallet where they own the private keys unless the lending rates go to really mental heights.\n\nHow is your bitcoin funding rate strategy important influencing your overall cryptocurrency strategy?\n\nToo many cryptocurrency traders don’t really think they need a strategy for margin lending, because in lending they cannot get margin called.\n\nThey don’t realize that by being careless like this they are having an impact on the crypto market as a whole.\n\nKeep reading if this sounds like a surprise to you.\n\nYour current crypto lending options\n\nMargin lending is the only way to yield interest on your crypto without opening a trading position, or without wrapping your crypto in a DeFi contract.\n\nFor the sake of completeness, I will briefly cover the other non-DeFi way to collect interest, which is by trading perpetual swaps. It can be the BitMEX perps but there are equivalent products on other exchanges available now.\n\n\n  Perpetual swap is a derivatives product that is pegged to a spot market, such as BTCUSD.\n  Interest rates, or funding rates, in perpetual swaps serve as a mechanism to regulate the peg.\n  As traders open directional positions to speculate on the price of the cryptocurrency, they create a bias on the market - such as a bullish bias.\n  The bias will make the perps market deviate from its spot market.\n  A deviation from the peg will trigger a change in the funding rates. At some point it will be convenient to enter a position against the market’s trend, because your loss from that will be smaller than your profit from the funding rate.\n  As traders flock in to collect the interest rate profit, the market returns back to the peg.\n\n\nThis strategy post is about the classic crypto margin lending, where you lend money to other crypto traders on the same platform without opening a trading position. You can do this on some of the crypto trading platforms that offer margin trading.\n\nBitfinex launched a new lending interface in autumn 2020 (Lending PRO). It’s safe to say Bitfinex offers the best margin lending product on the crypto trading scene right now.\n\nOther than that, you can margin lend on Poloniex. Both these exchanges are inherently shady, neither requires KYC or any kind of ID verification to let you access lending.\n\nSign up at Bitfinex\n\n\n  We have a 101 guide on how to start automated trading crypto, including margin lending automation. Read here.\n\n\nEstimating the risk of margin lending\n\nTo decide whether it is rational for you to provide money through margin funding on a crypto trading platform, you need to find your lowest acceptable rate. That is the lowest interest rate you are willing to accept to lend your cryptoasset.\n\nThe metric for deciding whether a rate is acceptable will be a comparison of how much you are risking to lose vs how much you are expecting to gain.\n\nIn margin lending on a custodial platform, your biggest risk is that the exchange will get hacked, bankrupt, exit scam or just go tits up in any other way. Yeah, the scenario that “never” happens, until it actually happens.\n\nThere are other things to consider:\n\n\n  Not the exchange but your account can get hacked.\n  Opportunity cost. Are you deciding between lending vs trading? Are you keeping USD for lending when you would make more in terms of dollars by buying a crypto?\n  There can be a fork with the exchange issuing a statement they won’t grant the new chain to lenders.\n  Margin call cascade that will make borrowers default. This is a real possibility on exchanges with high leverage, such as BitMEX, although these platforms typically have an insurance fund for these occasions.\n\n\n\n  It is not reasonable to go into exact figures when you don’t have the data to back up a sensible calculation.\n\n\nWe don’t know how likely which event is and we cannot reasonably project similar data from legacy markets on crypto.\n\nCrypto markets changing quickly and trading platforms are adopting these changes early to stay on top of the game - think DeFi. Because of this constant development there is not yet enough past data to make a reasonable risk model. It is too many unknown unknowns to go into exact numbers.\n\nOne rational thing you can do in an unstable environment like this is to set the bar high enough to have some cushion.\n\n\n  Rate with a cushion: Find a minimum acceptable rate with enough of a leeway to justify your risk of loss.\n  Treat it like a trade: Tweak how much of your stash you are lending based on how high the interest rate level is.\n\n\nWhy are daily interest rates useless\n\n\n  To get ballpark numbers, work with the assumption that any exchange gets hacked once a year.\n\n\nExchanges give you daily rate, which is not the format we are used to when we deal with fiat interest rates. Other than that, it is inconvenient to think in terms of daily rates if you want to factor in your risk.\n\nIf you provide money for margin lending on a custodial exchange, you are mainly risking an exchange hack. As explained above, there are other risks, some of which may be unknown unknowns.\n\nThe unknown unknowns are the reason why it is less important to think in terms exact numbers, and more reasonable to think in the directon of a cushion of profit that will make you comfortable enough with the idea of losing it all.\n\nTo get a mental image, you can work with the assumption that your exchange or your account on it gets hacked once a year, and you lose all of your lending deposit.\n\nNow that we have a way to picture what we’re realistically risking in a yearly timeframe, let’s also convert our returns to yearly format.\n\nHow to calculate yearly interest rate from daily interest rates on Bitfinex\n\nWe need to convert the daily interest rate provided by the exchange to a yearly return with compounding, that is including the profits from lending out your lending profits as well, and after the fees your exchange will charge you for providing funding.\n\nBitfinex will give your yearly return rate directly in the overview of lending rates - the APR column:\n\n\n\nNevertheless, you will still need to look at some spreadsheet math I will do for you in the next section to decide on your minimum acceptable lending rate.\n\nHere’s the basic formula to calculate lending profits with compound interest, before fees:\n\nA = P x (1 + r)^n\n\nA\t... end amount\nP\t... principal (starting amount)\nr\t... decimal rate per single period (1 day in this case)\nn\t... number of periods (365 in this case)\n\n\nBitfinex takes at least 15% cut from your lending profit. The fee is higher if you post hidden lending offers.\n\n\n  Sign up with shill code 5egV78YtlC to get a 6% fee discount on Bitfinex lending market.\n\n\nHere’s the formula for profit adjusted for Bitfinex 15% lending fee:\n\nB = (A - P) x (1 - fee)\n\nB ... cash profit after fees\nfee ... 0.15\n\n\n\nIn percents, that would be\n\nC = 100 x B / P\n\nC ... yearly percent return on principal\n\n\n\nWorking with lending rates fluctuations\n\nDaily margin lending rates fluctuate wildly, but they are not completely random.\n\nTraders get used to seeing certain interest rate levels as normal. These levels become something like a support level, as you would say in a technical analysis speak. Lenders are reluctant to keep their money locked in lending when the rates are lower than that.\n\nFor years, this popular minimum on Bitfinex has been around 0.01% daily.\n\nOn the contrary, the upside is much less limited. Super high rates on USD are quite normal during FOMO bull runs when everyone wants to go long. The neighborhood of 0.15% a day for USD on Bitfinex was not a rare thing to see during the 2017 crypto bull market.\n\n\n\nSo while it is not reasonable to expect you’ll be able to get the same rate every day every month, it is also not off to expect juicy rates.\n\nIt is a reasonable strategy to refrain from lending if the rates keep low, or to lend smaller amount, and to keep money in reserve for when the markets start moving abruptly. The upside potential there is big enough to justify that.\n\nThe last thing to show is the way to establish your minimum acceptable rate, and why the popular minimum rate is not good high enough.\n\n\n\nYour minimum acceptable daily rate\n\nNow, finally for spreadheet magic.\n\nLet’s take a look at how your yearly returns change if your average daily rate changes just a little.\n\nI’ll start with the USD daily rate of 0.01%, which is the popular “floor” rate on Bitfinex. As with anything popular, there’s probably no other reason to it than that it’s a nice number.\n\n\n  \n    \n      P\n      $20,000\n      $20,000\n      $20,000\n      $20,000\n      $20,000\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      r\n      1.0001\n      1.00015\n      1.0003\n      1.001\n      1.002\n    \n    \n      A\n      $20,743\n      $21,125\n      $22,314\n      $28,805\n      $41,471\n    \n    \n      B\n      $632\n      $957\n      $1,967\n      $7,484\n      $18,251\n    \n    \n      C\n      3%\n      5%\n      10%\n      37%\n      91%\n    \n  \n\n\nA ... end amount before fees\nB ... cash profit after fees\nC ... percent return after fees\n\nprincipal $20,000\nn = 365 days\ndaily rates: 0.01%, 0.015%, 0.03%, 0.1%, 0.2%\n\n\nYou see that the popular mental threshold of 0.01% daily gives only 3% return per year with compounding. That is six hundred dollars earned on twenty thousand dollars left exposed to constant risk for 365 days straight.\n\nIt’s much higher than any interest rate you can get from a bank these days, true enough. But if you really feel like this profit is high enough to justify giving away the custody of your crypto to a platform that you have no reason to trust, there is something wrong with you.\n\nA more reasonable floor is 0.03% which is around 10% return per annum.\n\nLending position size management\n\nAs in trading, the worst mistake here is to lend more money when the rates go down, because you want to fill your monthly profit target.\n\nIf the rates are down there is simply not the opportunity for lending at the moment. It is perhaps more convenient to borrow, actually. Or maybe to stay out of the market.\n\nWith lending, you should scale your position the same way you do when you’re trading: adding to your winners (that is, when the rates are rising) and cutting your losers (in this case, when the rates are getting too low).\n\nIf you really want to be careless about your money, please, get off Polo and Finex. Go to Cloudbet, gamble away and really do have at least some fun while you’re at it. Don’t be a sucker lending for next to nothing.\n\nLending: The “better than nothing” fallacy\n\nThis is something that has been cropping out on Reddit, particularly on subreddits related to newer altcoins.\n\nThere was an uproar on r/IOTA when Bitfinex kicked out US customers on 9th November 2017. The problem was an unbelievable one: Where do I send my coins?! I don’t want to install the wallet it’s too complicated?!\n\nTurns out IOTA early holders would lend their holdings on Bitfinex, even though the rates were stable at literal next to nothing - 0.000001% a day level.\n\nHow big a chunk of the lending books are people who want to store their altcoin on an exchange and think, well, it’s better than nothing?\n\nThis is a mistake. Maybe it will not end up in terrible disaster this time, but if you keep handling your crypto like this, eventually the inevitable will strike.\n\nIn crypto lending, better than nothing is NOT better than nothing. You are still exposed to risks.\n\nWhat are you actually doing when you are lending cryptocurrency for peanuts\n\nSome lend their cryptocurrency at a rate from the top of the book, because they want to see it get filled. There’s a lot of people like that, which means someone will come front-run you with a cheaper offer, only to get front-run by the next sucker.\n\nEventually, somebody in the right mind will be happy to take all the cheap coins. And to use them. For shorting. Shorting the currency the suckers are long-term holders of but keep it on an exchange in lending, even though it doesn’t pay off.\n\nIn particular, by lending your crypto for peanuts you are making monster whale shorts positions effectively free. All because you refuse to handle your own crypto wallet or are a victim of the “better than nothing” fallacy.\n\nIf you really don’t want to withdraw a cryptocurrency from an exchange – which is a mistake but you already know that – just don’t give it away to other traders for next to nothing.\n\n\n\nThanks to u/middle0fnowhere for feedback.\n\n\n",

Get the free trial now and upgrade in Black Friday week!\nWe have more Wyckoff in the “Wyckoff Trading” tag in the blog\n\n\nWyckoff Method Definition\n\nWyckoff Method is a strategic approach to trading.\n\nThe method is based on supply and demand.\n\nSupply and demand is the basic dynamic at the root of market cycles. Richard Wyckoff, the method’s author, came up with patterns that simplify the analysis of market cycles.\n\nThe method was originally meant for stock markets. It is most useful on crypto markets these days.\n\nBest Timeframe For Wyckoff\n\nWyckoff works in terms of supply and demand. This dynamic exists on any timeframe, but it has a bias.\n\nIt is best to start with higher timeframes.\n\nLook for Wyckoff phases, establish the market bias, then look into details.\n\nFor initial analysis, the 1D timeframe is most recommended. It’s easy to get with TradingView FREE plan.\n\nWyckoff Phases\n\nWyckoff divides each market cycle into phases.\n\nIn each phase, the market has a characteristic direction:\n\n\n  Markup phase: The market steadily advances\n  Markdown phase: The market steadily declines\n  Accumulation, Reaccumulation and Distribution phase: The market ranges (moves sideways)\n\n\nThis post focuses on Wyckoff method for ranging markets.\n\nWe will focus on Accumulation, Reaccumulation and Distribution phase here.\n\nWyckoff Method in Crypto\n\nWyckoff method entered the crypto trading community thanks to John Bollinger, the inventor of bbands.\n\nHe also suggested combining Wyckoff method with bbands.\n\n\n  ATNET Glossary: BBands\n\n\nWyckoff Method with Bollinger Bands\n\nAll you need to do to combine Wyckoff Method and BBands is to treat the lines in BBands as baselines.\n\nInstead of looking for new lows or new highs in terms of price, you look at their distance from BBands.\n\nThis approach is great for ranging markets, as Bollinger described himself on Meb Faber’s show:\n\n\n  “Bollinger Bands work fantastic on Bitcoin. And they work fantastic on all forex. There’s a reason for that. Currency trading is pairs trading - you’re long one and short the other, essentially. The idea is to earn a return at reduced volatility over time. So, forex is pairs trading and pairs have a statistical property, they’re stationary or they exhibit in the statistical parlance, stationarity. And it just turns out that Bollinger Bands work just a little bit better with series that exhibit stationarity. So, there is sort of a built-in edge to using Bollinger Bands on anything that’s a pair.”\n\n\nThis approach is great for ranging markets, because that’s where the pair behaviour is strongest in markets like BTCUSD.\n\n\n  Ranging markets have lower volatility.\n  With lower volatility the market is more likely to stay inside the BBands.\n  It’s easy to measure how far any new lows or highs got from their side of the BBands.\n\n\nWe will go more into market ranges in the following section.\n\n \n\nRead Later?\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n          \n        \n      \n      \n        The psychology of reversals\n        Wyckoff ranges are often used to spot market reversals. The important ones, on higher timeframes. You have to understand the market psychology during a developing reversal to be able to use Wyckoff properly.\n      \n    \n    \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n          \n        \n      \n      \n        Script spotlight - bollinger bandwidth\n        Review of Bollinger Bandwidth Strategy from the TradingView script library.\n      \n    \n    \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n          \n        \n      \n      \n        Pattern trading in crypto (atnet glossary)\n        What are the highest probability patterns in crypto? How to do pattern trading right? How to not be a head-and-shoulders loser?\n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n \n\nMarket Ranges\n\nA little recap.\n\nWyckoff divides each market cycle into phases.\n\nIn each phase, the market has a characteristic direction - or a lack of direction.\n\n\n  Ranges are market phases where volatility is low and price is confined within a certain level.\n\n\nIt might be tempting to say that the most important phase of the market cycle is the one in which the asset gains the most. But according to Wyckoff, ranges are in fact the key market phases. It is during sideways actions that the future bull run brews…Or the future bear slump.\n\nWhy are Ranges Key in Wyckoff\n\nWyckoff says market ranges are key.\n\nWhat does it mean for you as a trader?\n\nMarket ranges are where experienced traders start scaling into a position in the anticipated direction.\n\nThis is the only way to avoid FOMO. Once the sideways phase is over and the market starts moving, you will be already riding on a profit. At this stage you can check the market once a day, maybe move your stop loss and move on with your life.\n\nRecognize a Market range\n\n\n  Ranges are market structures where the market is not trending.\n  Ranging market is bouncing (roughly!) between the same two support and resistance levels\n  Volume is typically declining with time.\n\n\nThis post focuses on ranging markets. That means will focus on Accumulation, Reaccumulation and Distribution phase here.\n\nWyckoff Phases: Accumulation, Reaccumulation and Distribution\n\n\n\nLet’s explain each of the key Wyckoff ranges in simple terms:\n\n\n  Accumulation phase: The long, slow bottom of the bear market.\n  Reaccumulation phase: The breather pause midway through the run-up.\n  Distribution phase: The topping pattern with multiple highs at the end of a bull run.\n\n\nPretty clear huh?\n\nSo, how do you tell whether the market is just taking a breather (reaccumulation) or whether it is actually the top (distribution)?\n\nWyckoff Reaccumulation vs Wyckoff Distribution\n\nHindsight is 20/20. From the high-level point of view, there is only one difference.\n\nEither the market continues to rise, or it goes to Goblin town.\n\nThat’s not very helpful when analysing the market, is it?\n\nThe cue here is to look deeper into the market structures. You will see that the distribution and re-accumulation phases do differ.\n\nLet’s look into the ways you can tell one from another.\n\nSupply and Demand Patterns\n\nThe difference between Wyckoff distribution and Wyckoff reaccumulation boils down to the basics of supply and demand.\n\nThe basic principle of supply and demand is particularly important for crypto. The cryptocurrency markets not too regulated, there is less of institutional players, high-frequency trading is not as rampant.\n\nCrypto is a good place to look at longer-term market characteristics.\n\nThe basic supply-demand dynamic goes like this:\n\n\n  Excess supply leads to decrease in price.\n  Excess demand leads to price increase\n\n\nWyckoff adds one additional point:\n\n\n  The volume and the price change must be in harmony.\n\n\nThis is the so-called Wyckoff law of effort vs result.\n\nA big price jump on thin volume is less valid than a price jump on high volume.\n\nAdditionally, small price change on high volume says that there is a lot of people on the other side of the market.\n\nStereotypical Market Behavior Patterns\n\nThis is first cue to telling reaccumulation from distribution range.\n\nLong-term traders or hodlers will understand it easily.\n\n\n  ATNET Glossary on Market Psychology\n\n\nThere are typical behaviors that the market displays at the deal-breaking moments of market cycles.\n\nIn Wyckoff method, there are two critical patterns that you definitely should know. Both these patterns occur at the end of a market range, just when it becomes clearer to everybody which way the market is heading.\n\nWyckoff Range-End Patterns:\n\n\n  “Trying to jump the creek”: The market rallies up towards a resistance level several times. It does not have to be the upper bound of the whole range, it can be an interim resistance! It gets rejected every time, there’s selling activity around the resistance line, but the sell-offs do not generate a lot of volume or follow-through.\n  “Walking on thin ice”: The market is pressing down towards a support level. It does not have to be the lower bound of the whole range, it can be an interim support! On this support level, it gets bought up, but the volume in these rallies is thin. The buying activity will not last long, the market will move south.\n\n\nThese end patterns can be positioned mid way through the range, which can be confusing. The key metric to follow here is volume vs price change.\n\n\n  Small price change on high volume says that there is a lot of people on the other side of the market.\n  Large price change on large volume says the market is likely to move in the current direction.\n\n\nLearn to read these range-end situations. You will be in the best position to ride a trend from the moment when its direction is in all likelihood decided but a lot of other traders did not get the memo yet.\n\nMarket Reversal Patterns on BBands\n\nBolling Bands reversal patterns likewise rely on stereotypical market psychology.\n\n\n  Typical Top: “Three pushes to a high”, which shows market greed. More on three-pushes patterns in ATNET Glossary.\n  Typical Bottom: “W-Bottom”, which shows market fear.\n\n\nThese two reversal patterns are, in fact, market ranges.\n\nThey are simpler and shorter than Wyckoff ranges, but they are still ranges. Markets don’t turn around and reverse within one 5 minute candle, unless they are a shitcoin market traded by maybe 4 people.\n\nOn markets with decent liquidity, like BTCUSD, such an instant agreement doesn’t happen.\n\nNow that we know reversal patterns are ranges, we know how to use Bollinger bands with then: BBands provide the balance boundaries for a market range.\n\nThe center line on Bollinger Bands (a moving average) is the mean price around which the ranging occurs. To you that will be the baseline.\n\nYour edge is in that this line is not perfectly horizontal.\n\nA simple horizontal price level is most other traders’ baseline.\n\nThe upper and lower Bollinger Bands are standard deviations of the baseline. Quite intuitively, they tell you how far the market overshoots in each direction.\n\nTo you, the standard deviations will be the limit of the market range, even though they are not perfectly horizontal.\n\nTelling a continuation pattern (Wyckoff’s reaccumulation) from a top pattern (Wyckoff’s distribution) becomes quite easy.\n\n\n  If you expect the market to move on in a bullish bias, you absolutely need to see it to progressively overshoot downwards less and less\n\n\nIn a Wyckoff w/ BBands setup, this translates as higher lows relatively to the lower BBand.\n\nDue to market psychology, this will typically look like a “W”. There will only be two lows, on the second one people will start noticing the good buy opportunity.\n\n\n  If you expect the market to move on in a bearish bias, you absolutely need to see it to progressively overshoot upwards less and less\n\n\nIn a Wyckoff w/ BBands setup, this translates as lower highs relatively to the upper BBand.\n\nDue to market psychology, there will typically be three highs. Quite some traders will be buying up here, expecting the market to continue up, “as always”. The long bias is the reason why the topping pattern has 3 peaks and the bottoming one 2 throughs.\n\nYou can absolutely look for lower highs and lower lows relative to the price as well, of course. It’s not wrong, it’s just a bit too basic.\n\nWith BBands, the same information gets clear sooner.\n\n\n\nTradingView Tools for Wyckoff Trading\n\n\n  Make your FREE TradingView account here!\n\n\nVolume Indicators\n\nVolume vs price change is key information in Wyckoff analysis.\n\nEither the price change and volume are in sync, or there is a divergence between them:\n\n\n  Price drops. Volume is rising while price gradually drops less and less with every new candle – that’s a price vs volume divergence.\n\n\nThis situation tells us that there is significant demand. Thanks to this demand, the drop will not be able to continue for much longer.\n\n\n  Price drops. Volume is rising while price keeps sliding down – no divergence here.\n\n\nThere is not enough demand and plenty of supply. The price is bound to drop some more.\n\n\n  Price rallies. Volume is rising but price starts topping – again, that’s a divergence.\n\n\nLocal top there, there is not enough demand to push through.\n\n\n  Price rallies. Volume is rising and price is still pumping – no divergence here.\n\n\nThe market will keep going.\n\nMeasuring Volume On TradingView\n\nThere are classic volume-based indicators like on-balance volume.\n\nI find the easiest kind of volume indicator to work with are colored candles.\n\nThere are a bunch of scripts on TradingView, this one is pretty good:\n\nVolume Flow Script by spacetrader\n\n\n  Make a TradingView account.\n  Get the script or search for [ST] Volume Flow v6 in the script library.\n  Read the color key.\n\n\n\n\nMeasuring Price Change On TradingView\n\nROC (rate of change) is a default technical indicator available from the TradingView as well as on crypto trading platforms that use TradingView charts.\n\nBitfinex charts have the ROC option.\n\nBollinger Bands on TradingView\n\nSince BBands are one of the most popular charting tools not only for crypto markets, there is a lot of scripts and strategies on TradingView that feature them.\n\n\n  Bollinger Bandwidth to alert you on range ends, which are the periods of lowest volatility\n  The %B indicator telling you the distance of the current price of its band\n  For scalpers, there are even ready-made TradingView strategies with BBands. They are very simple, but something to work with.\n\n\n1W/1D Wyckoff Range Study: BTCUSD in 2017\n\nAs they say, hindsight is 20/20.\n\nStill, let’s take a look at the market ranges that we got during the year of bitcoin’s 20k ATH.\n\nExhibit A: Weekly BTCUSD chart with the infamous 2-year bear market:\n\nDo you see the accumulation structure at the bottom? This is where the bull run was born.\n\n\n\nExhibit B: Daily BTCUSD chart of a BTCUSD continuation action.\n\n\n\nThe structure A/ formed after a long downtrend. Back then, crypto as a whole was shaken by MtGox bankruptcy.\n\nThe common opinion was that bitcoin was going to bleed out into death and that the cryptocurrency experiment failed.\n\nFrom a different point of view, savvy investors were in the position to literally buy bitcoin wholesale.\n\nBuying the capitulation, provided the trader sees a fundamental opportunity in the asset.\n\nIn this case the individual narrative could have been that there simply are situations that require a payment method resistant to censorship and regulations. A collapse of an exchange could not have any impact on that.\n\nW-Bottom Study: Simple W-Bottom vs BBand W-Bottom\n\n\n\nLet’s take the W-bottom formation. On the chart’s vertical axis only, you’d think of it like this:\n\n\n  If the price of a bottom 2 is higher than the price of bottom 1, it’s a higher low and a convincing bounce.\n  If the prices are the same, it’s still a W-bottom but somewhat weaker.\n  If the bottom 2 is lower, it might not be the final bottom yet.\n\n\nWith bbands you will look for the 3-push and W-bottom structures relative to the bbands:\n\n\n  If the bottom 2 has lower price than bottom 1 but is farther up from the lower bband than bottom 1, it’s a strongly convincing bottom. The edge lies in the fact that it’s a higher low relatively to the bbands, a bullish structure that a lot of traders will miss.\n\n\nDeeper Analysis: Ranges within ranges\n\nThis will be useful for short-term traders.\n\nLet’s zoom into shorter timeframes and look for ranges within the range.\n\n\n  In every range, there will be part of a price action that will trade closer to the upper boundary of the range. That can be identified as the micro-distribution.\n  From there, the price might drop to the middle of the range or deeper and consolidate there for a bit.\n  In crypto, it typically results in a deeper drop: the micro-accumulation.\n  From there, the price gets bought up towards the middle of the range again. The future direction depends among other things on the strength of the bounce.\n\n\nYou can use micro-ranges either to scalp the range (this is called formation scalping), or to get more information about the market bias that is currently forming.\n\nFinding the inner market ranges\n\nStart at a high timeframe and find the macro-range.\n\nHere is a 1D BTCUSD with a range:\n\n\n\nNow let’s switch to 4H:\n\n\n\nHere you can easily spot the first micro reaccumulation range:\n\n\n  Market reaches a resistance, tests it several times. In this case there were some long-term Fibonacci retracement lines.\n  Relevant bband basis starts curling down.\n  Price-wise, higher highs form but are already further from the upper bband, indicating weakness.\n  Eventually, the market drops below the bband basis and fails to return up over it.\n  Panic drop occurs but is bought up with force.\n  Market continues upwards.\n\n\nThe second inner range was a distribution:\n\n\n  Market hits an important fib line and makes a sharp top.\n  Negative volume keeps picking up.\n  Drop to median of the outer range (red dashed line) gets bought up but this rally crashes and fails to push through resistance.\n  In a very simplified way you can say that if the price keeps pressing onto a support/resistance for some time, you can assume it will break it, even if only for short time. With support/resistance, it’s typically either a clear bounce, or it goes through.\n  Market continues downwards.\n\n\nOn the whole:\n\n\n  Looking back at the 1D chart, the market made a W-bottom\n  This higher low happened both price-wise and relatively to the bband\n  Then the market managed to push through a resistance line\n\n\nThe verdict is a reaccumulation: A continuation structure in a bull trend.\n\nLooking at micro-ranges will give you more information about the state of the market.\n\nThis will translate into the longer-term market bias, but at the same time it will let you make some extra profit short-term trading.\n\nRelevant ATNET Glossary Entries\n\n\n  BBands\n  Pattern Trading (hub)\n  TV\n  Scalping\n  Market Psychology\n  HODL\n\n",

      title: "Market Timing in Crypto",
      content: "Market timing has a bad rap.\n\nYou probably know what they say: “Time in the market beats timing the market.”\n\nThis is a saying coined in the heyday of stock trading. Back then it was still reasonable to assume the markets will just keep going up. One no longer feels this is a rational expectation nowadays.\n\nLuckily, it is certainly possible to tell whether it is time for daring or time for caution.\n\nThat’s what timing tools are for.\n\nMarket Timing Approach\n\nMarket timing is not a dubious thing based on intuition.\n\nTiming is simply a method to learn about the bigger picture. In case of crypto that is the strength of all crypto markets, rather than just the one you trade on.\n\nFocusing on a single market only is a mistake, but it is easy to do if you only rely on plain technical analysis.\n\nOnly going by TA on a single market makes it easy to miss critical information.\n\nFor instance: If you only watch BTCUSD, you can miss the information about money leaving crypto altogether. BTCUSD is the strongest market of the industry; the outflow of money will take the longest time to show on the BTCUSD market.\n\nMarket Timing in Crypto\n\nThese days, cryptocurrency market are as diverse as the stock markets.\n\nFundamental value of various cryptoassets is starting to differentiate, and now with DeFi and other shitcoins we even have the perfect equivalent of penny stocks.\n\nCrypto indexes have been around since 2017, in other words, since the first mainstream boom of crypto. They are not as complex as indexes for the legacy markets, but they are already good to be used for market timing.\n\nTechnical Market Timing Tools\nCrypto Indexes (Baskets of Cryptoassets)\n\nBasket indexes for crypto markets were modelled after legacy basket indexes.\n\nSome adjustments were necessary, since the cryptocurrency markets are still in their infancy and most of the cumulative USD value of the crypto industry comes from a single coin.\n\nStill, we now have both market cap weighted indexes (like S&amp;P 500 or NASDAQ) and price weighted indexes (like the Japanese Nikkei).\n\nMarket cap weighted cryptocurrency indexes\n\n\n  \n    CCI30 - cci30.com is a basket of top 30 coins by market cap (excluding stablecoins). The constituents are automatically updated on the first calendar day of a quarter. This index is the best choice for statistics and as a crypto market timing tool.\n  \n  \n    Crypto20 - crypto20.com is a tokenized index that can be traded on some altcoin exchanges. This index now caps every asset at 10%, which makes it less suitable for broad market timing analysis - it does not represent the realities of the markets well.\n  \n\n\nPrice weighted cryptocurrency indexes\n\n\n  CryptoCompare - cryptocompare.com This product aggregates price data for each cryptocurrency and returns volume-weighted average price for every market.\n\n\nIf you want to use this index as a market timing tool, you will need to make a price-weighted basket out of this (very accurate price) data yourself in a spreadsheet.\n\nThe formula of price-weighted basket index is super simple though: For an index of 30 constituents just take the top 30 most expensive cryptos and calculate the simple average of that set.\n\nPrice-Weighted Index Formula = (Sum of constituent prices in index) / (Number of constituents)\n\nHow to use crypto indices?\n\nThe easiest way that requires minimal skills to plot the price action of the basket index together with the price action of a single cryptocurrency, and see how they compare.\n\nThis is a simple way to understand how money moves through the cryptocurrency markets.\n\nTools that let you compare a basket index with a single crypto are readily available too:\n\n\n  Plotting multiple charts and even custom data is possible with TradingView PRO plans.\n  To check whether your market or the index moves at faster pace, use even very basic technical indicators:\n    \n      ROC (Rate of Change).\n      RSI (Relative Strength Index)\n      Advance/Decline Line\n      Intraday Intensity Index\n    \n  \n\n\nThe Advance/Decline Line is an indicator worth learning about to use with basket indices. There is an easy to spot “divergence” signal for ends of market cycles.\n\n\n  The ADL topping signal is found when the price of the constituent assets is not declining yet, but the ADL already is.\n  The ADL bottoming signal is found when the price of the constituent assets is not rising yet, but the ADL already is.\n\n\nThe Intraday Intensity Index is more useful for looking into money flows within a single cryptocurrency market.\n\nBASIC EXAMPLE\n\nLet’s say you are plotting BTCUSD over CCI30. You want to understand how money moves through the crypto industry and whether the markets are in good shape. That’s easy to do, no complicated statistics or strategy necessary.\n\nFirst let’s make a mental note of what you are looking at: BTCUSD is the strongest asset of the industry, CCI30 is a basket of any altcoins that happen to have large market cap at the moment.\n\nWhen you plot these two, you will see one of the following scenarios:\n\n\n\n1. Both BTCUSD and CCI30 goes up, but the price of BTC is growing at a faster pace.\n\nThis says that money is leaving altcoins and gets into BTC.\n\nIt can mean simply the end of alt season, or even just and end of a speculative trend. Let’s say, people could be losing interest in DeFi. It could also mean that overall bull market is over though, but as BTCUSD is the strongest asset, the BTCUSD price action doesn’t reflect the end of the bull yet.\n\n\n  The same situation, just with higher intensity is taking place when there’s a divergence: BTCUSD is advancing, CCI30 declining.\n\n\n2. Both BTCUSD and CCI30 goes up, but the price of CCI30 is growing at a faster pace.\n\nThis says that money is flowing into altcoins.\n\nThe direction of the money points either at the increased interest in speculation, or at a real fundamental change at the market. Maybe there is actually a viable DeFi application, maybe there is a new altcoin to dethrone BTC.\n\n\n  The same situation, just with higher intensity is taking place when there’s a divergence: CCI30 is advancing, BTCUDS declining.\n\n\n\n\nThere are literally no other options.\n\nNow, you see each of these situation generates a number of claims about the state of the crypto markets.\n\nIn order to see whether it’s time to buy more or a time to look for exit, you will need to determine which one of the claims has the best odds.\n\nTo verify the odds of any of these claims, look into technical analysis as well as the non-technical market timing tools listed below.\n\nNon-Technical Market Timing Tools\nFundamental Metrics &amp; Market Psychology\n\nLegacy market timing makes use of things like unemployment rates, treasury yield curves, weekly and seasonal cycles and developments in industries that are most sensitive to changes in general psychology (such as entertainment or health industries).\n\nCrypto is of course not immune to changes in public psychology. A lot can be read using the same ways legacy markets analysts use: The money flowing into markets are the same, it is just the preference of the instrument that differs (crypto or stocks).\n\nAs for the systemic metrics, cryptocurrencies have their own market metrics that we can easily draw conclusions from.\n\n1. High non-speculative transaction rates are a signal of strong market:\n\n\n  Fundamental metrics such as transaction rates.\n  The percentage of transaction activity coming from exchanges vs from native applications or p2p value transfer (depends on the focus of the cryptocurrency).\n  For payment-focused cryptos, there are additional fundamentals such as the growth in ATM count, merchant adoption or p2p markets growth.\n\n\n2. Popularity of new applications can be either good or bad.\n\n\n  Popularity of cryptokitties may get more people into cryptocurrencies, but it may also have adverse effect on the cost of transaction. At the same time, dApp games did decline along with the approach of the bear market through 2018.\n\n\n3. The signs of irrational exuberance and the same in legacy and crypto market as well.\n\n\n  Your grandma buying crypto at the Christmas dinner and attempts to buy bitcoins on credit.\n\n\nSome data for you to play with\n\nWe will test the powers Advance-Decline ratio.\n\nTo get the basket of cryptos we are using the CCI30 index.\n\n\n  If you work with TradingView PRO, all the data and indicators are there.\n  Alternatively, you can get Advance-Decline Line calculated in a spreadsheet by adding each day’s contribution to the sum of previous contributions. Historical daily closing prices of each altcoin constituent of CCI30 can be taken from Coinmarketcap.\n\n\nThe limitation of work with crypto indexes is that you will only get good data about the broad state of the market. The CCI30 constituents change multiple times a quarter!\n\nThis is still good enough to determine whether the market is nearing the top or whether it’s still healthy.\n\nThe Advance-Decline of a Basket Index: Finding the Top\n\nThe early ADL topping signal is found when the price of the constituent assets is not declining yet, but the ADL already is.\n\nBelow we’re adding a dataset of February to April 2018. This signal was found in that time span on the BTCUSD market. Price-wise, this coincided with bitcoin’s bounce to 12k USD after the fall from 2017 ATH. The ADL signal correctly determined that bounce as unsustainable.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nData:\n\nDaily closes of the 30 constituents as CSVs\n\nSloppy but functional script to calculate the Advance-Decline Line\n\nSource for the charts from the PDF above\n\nCCI30 full OHLC history (daily data as provided at cci30.com) and also the history of its constituents\n\nThree months of daily close prices for the Q2 2018 constituents of CCI30 (pulled from coinmarketcap)\n\nSummary\n\nThe point of market timing is to establish whether to buy more or to look for exit.\n\nSimple comparison of a basket crypto index with a single market gives you good enough information on that.\n\nIt also removes your blind spots that come with focusing on a single crypto exclusively, even if that crypto is a strong asset.\n\nApplying technical indicators on basket indexes provides additional data and is not too time-consuming if done with tools like TradingView PRO.\n",

      title: "Strategy: Technical Analysis past ATH with Fibs",
      content: "Fibs are the poster child of classic technical analysis: Draws colourful lines on chart based on a string of numbers selected through an idea nobody understands. Fibs are a technical tool that everyone uses because everyone uses it.\n\n\n  Fibs are the black-box tool that everyone uses because everyone uses it. Don’t shun them because of that though.\n\n\n\n\nIn case you are a Fibs-virgin, let’s define what we’re talking about.\n\nFibs, or Fibonacci levels, are a tool that estimates future support or resistance levels. These estimates are based on some pretty opaque theory.\n\nOn a chart, Fibs look like this:\n\n\n\nHow to draw Fibs\n\nFibs are used when the market corrects or bounces. Those are short term movements that follow a more substantial run. The correction or bounce are not usually a start of a new trend, just a cool-off.\n\n\n  Fibonacci lines are useful during market retracements.\n\n\nThere is a good use case for Fibs together with Wyckoff for trading ranging markets.\n\n\n  In a correction (price decline after a run) you draw Fibs by clicking on the swing high and dragging to the swing low.\n    \n      The Fib retracement will expand upwards. The levels it shows are future resistance levels.\n    \n  \n  In a bounce (price increase after a slump) you draw Fibs by dragging from the swing low to the swing high.\n    \n      The Fib retracement will expand downwards. That gives you the estimated support levels.\n    \n  \n\n\nGet Fibs on TradingView FREE\n\nFibs are constructed the same way at every market: It will always be, say, 1.618 no matter if the Fib is plotted on oil futures chart or on ETHUSD.\n\nIt would be easy to dismiss Fibs as an irrational tool that deserves to disappear from history.\n\nOn markets trending above previous ATH there is no price history to work out support and resistance from. It just so happens that traders like to use Fib lines to estimate future support and resistance levels. As long as everyone uses Fibonacci lines, they will work because people will set their orders around them.\n\nMrJozza in the following short video explains the concept of trading on Fibs with examples on BTCUSD:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy does everyone in crypto use Fibs?\n\nFibonacci retracements are the bread and butter of cryptocurrency trading.\n\nIf you only came to crypto after 2017, maybe you don’t think so. But watch the Fib charters pop up once a big cryptocurrency pair makes it past its ATH.\n\nAnd that’s exactly the reason why Fibs gained so much popularity on crypto markets.\n\n\n  When a market is new, like cryptos were even quite recently, there is no price history.\n  Without price history, most technical analysis tools go to pieces, because they need some input data to make statistics from.\n  With no price history, you can’t even draw suppport and resistance lines…\n  …Just like you can’t draw support and resistance on a market that’s past the ATH.\n\n\nA Tool that facilitates agreement\n\nFibs could be based on a completely random sequence of numbers for all we know. It makes no difference. As long as traders will want to set up their take-profit orders, Fibs will always work.\n\nThat doesn’t mean that Fibs don’t leave room for the actual free market, though.\n\nThey are simply an easy to use tool that marks the price zones where crypto traders start taking profits.\n\nFor every retracement, you are always gives multiple Fib levels: 0.618, 1.618, 2.618, 4.236.\n\nThe market sentiment will show itself in the level of the Fib line that will eventually end up being the reversal.\n\n\n  Is it lower high?\n  Is it higher high?\n  Is it way higher high?\n\n\nThe Fibs are just a suggestion pulled out of a mathematician’s a$$; for an extreme scenario the market can easily disregard all of them and just blast through.\n\nI hope you now see it would be a gross oversimplification to call even random black box tools like Fibs simply a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\nFlocking to an indicator is more common than you think\n\nIn April 2018, John Bollinger asked on Twitter what  everyone’s favorite technical indicators are.\n\nGiven that many people aspire to be like John Bollinger, we got this whole “notice me senpai” effect. It is safe to assume people told the truth.\n\n\n\nThe low variety of the results is not very surprising.\n\nTraders generally flock to the same indicator. And they rarely use a truly unique set up.\n\nUnless you live under a rock you’ll be well aware that when it comes to crypto trading, pretty much the same chart setup gets plastered all over cryptotwitter and cryptoreddit.\n\nThat is precisely the reason why Fibs work.\n\nBut be careful: It is also the reason why stop hunts happen.\n\nGet FREE TA tools on TradingView\n",

      title: "Best Practices for Profit-Taking: Fungibility of BTC, Coin Control and more",
      content: "This is a strategy post about a single specific facet of your crypto trading strategy, namely taking profits and exiting the crypto market.\n\nLet’s first start with a quick look at which crypto exchanges are at the top of the list when it comes to moving fiat money.\n\n\n  \n    \n      Aussie-based, licensed\n      \n        Independent Reserve\n        \n        International / USD, SGD, AUD, NZD\n        \n        OTC available, tax consulting available\n        \n        Invite Code: RCZSEV\n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      US-based, has banking license\n      \n        Kraken\n        \n        International / USD, EUR, JPY...\n        \n        OTC available\n        \n        Reportedly checks coin history\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nIn the ideal situation, you have bought coins fully verified at one of these exchanges, transferred them to an address that you can prove your ownership of and never moved them elsewhere until now when you send your coins back to the same exchange to sell them for fiat.\n\nThe issue is bitcoin’s, but also some other coins’, pseudonymous ledger. Some exchanges will check where the coins you are depositing came from, and big US exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken might reject deposits that have a casino history.\n\nGenerally speaking, with larger amounts your profit-taking will go far more smoothly if you sell coins that you provably bought on a KYC exchange, and then just held them.\n\nBut what if you are reusing addresses? What if you used you bitcoins as - duh - actual money?\n\nThere might still be ways.\n\nEnter Coin Control\n\nCoin control is a privacy feature of some cryptocurrency wallets. You may have already needed coin control if your wallet suffered from a dust attacks.\n\n\n  Read the ATNET Glossary entry about Coin Control.\n\n\nThe coin control feature can also help you sell your cryptocurrency stack with less trouble, though.\n\nIn this crypto strategy article we will show the best practices of coin control in Ledger and Electrum wallets. You’ve got to think ahead and this will make your future selling of crypto easier.\n\nWe will also go through your best profit taking options in case your stack moved around a lot and coin control is not an option anymore.\n\nCoin Control strategy for hodlers\n\nCoin control is an advanced feature of some cryptocurrency wallets that lets you choose which incoming transaction you want to spend and which to leave unspent.\n\nSome cryptocurrency exchanges do care about the history of your bitcoins.\n\nThe US exchange and trading platform Coinbase was the first in this cohort, rejecting bitcoin deposits whenever the coins had passed through a known casino wallet in the past.\n\nIt is not surprising considering that Coinbase was the first crypto exchange that was court-ordered to hand over customer information to authorities in 2018. It is not the sort of company that can afford the trouble of facilitating anything illegal.\n\nKraken, another US-based trading platform, followed soon after. Reports of people getting their bitcoin deposits rejected started popping out on Reddit, among them people who claimed they get paid in BTC and but their client sent them coins from god-knows-where.\n\nThe problem\n\nRemember, bitcoin is pseudonymous.\n\nVast majority of existing BTC addresses are unidentified, but wallets belonging to casinos, darknet marketplaces and trading platforms are easy to identify.\n\nThese wallets might not always have their owner exactly determined, but they will inevitably have higher frequency of transactions going through them, more money in them, or both. They are very easy to tell from your regular private wallet that belongs to an individual.\n\nThe solution (well, the ideal one)\n\nProve at which time point you bought the coins that you own.\n\nIf you can prove that the crypto you are selling is the same you, as a verified user, bought at a non-p2p exchange on a certain date, then that also proves it was NOT YOU who owned the coins when they were sent into a casino or a marketplace at any point in their deep and dark past.\n\nNon-p2p exchanges have deep order books, you cannot know who from you are buying or the history of that coins. That means you cannot be held responsible for anything that happened with the coins prior to your buying it.\n\nOnce a coin was bought and resold by identified users, practically speaking its past is cleaned.\n\nBitcoin fungibility problem solved.\n\nSchema in high-res here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBest Practices\n\nSelling with KYC what you bought with KYC\n\nAs long as you are a hodler, your situation is easy.\n\n\n  Keep your trade and withdrawal logs from the exchange where you bought.\n  Even better, sell at the same platform where you bought.\n  Always split coins that you got from KYC platforms from coins of non-KYC.\n\n\nYou probably moved from your OG address to Segwit\n\nIdeally you should be able to make a bitcoin signature with the address you used to withdraw the coins after you bought them on a KYC exchange.\n\nBut as long-term holder you have probably moved your stash from legacy to segwit addresses.\n\nThis will still pass. If you deposited from exchange to a legacy address, your access to the legacy address is proven by the fact that you sent the coins out of it.\n\nDid You Reuse Bitcoin Addresses?\n\nHow To Check Whether You Reused Bitcoin Addresses:\n\n\n  Retrieve your exchange withdrawal logs.\n  In your wallet, identify your coins by exchange.\n  If they are in different addresses, and you used different addresses for different exchanges, you’re good. You did not reuse addresses in a bad way.\n\n\nIf you reused a single BTC address for deposits from multiple exchanges, you might still be able to split out the coins that were bought for a fiat deposit somewhere.\n\n\n  Coins from P2P exchanges and coins that were on no-KYC derivative platforms like OKcoin futures will have to be considered “dirty”.\n\n\nLedger wallets, to take a popular example, use by default the “FIFO” method: First In First Out.\n\nThat means your oldest incoming coins get spent first.\n\nUnless you moved 100% of your wallet at one time, there is still chance you will be able to split your coins by their source.\n\nThis is how coin control looks in Ledger Live:\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat to do when your coins are mixed\n\nDid you move coins between wallets that you don’t own anymore?\n\nYou should still be OK as long as there are only personal addresses in between anything that you can verify.\n\nNo “hop” in your transaction sequence should look like a busy, high-traffic commercial hot wallet.\n\nKeep in mind that if something dodgy happened with your coins between the two points that you verified ownership of, you will have a hard time convincing the authorities it was not you who were in control of the coins at that point.\n\nDid you move coins around A LOT?\n\nIf you reused a single BTC address, you moved around the bulk a lot, and you traded at no-KYC platforms, you might have problems selling your coin.\n\nOne obvious solution are the P2P markets like LocalCryptos. You will not be able to trade large amounts there, but it could be good enough for “dollar cost averaging” out of the market.\n\nAnother option is making your purchase directly in cryptocurrency.\n\nAnd lastly, there is crypto-backed lending.\n\nLending as the way out\n\nThere has been a number of P2P lending platforms, both crypto and fiat backed.\n\nThe early ones mostly failed, the current ones have been around roughly since the ICO bubble but as of March 2021, none of them are properly licensed for they do, at least not in the US.\n\nThe two top crypto-backed loans providers that have at least some license for US are BlockFi and Nexo. You can verify it by looking them up in the Nationwide Multistate Licensing System at https://www.nmlsconsumeraccess.org/.\n\nIn 2020, Bitfinex also opened a new service called Bitfinex Borrow which lets you borrow large-cap cryptos or several fiat currencies for collateral made up of cryptos or fiat.\n\nCrypto-backed loans will be one way to buy your lambo if you cannot prove the origin of your holdings.\n\nOther than that, borrowing instead of selling can also be more convenient due to taxes.\n\nOther issues: Banking Routes are Sketchy\n\nTo illustrate what will likely happen to quite a few of us in the future, here is a post made on Thursday, February 15, 2018 to the official KrakenSupport subreddit.\n\n\n  Kraken won’t let me withdraw 160,000 USD.

      content: "In this Strategy:\n\n\n  Jump to scalping strategy examples\n  Jump to crypto bots for automation\n\n\nDefinition of Scalping Crypto\n\n\n  Scalping is a trading technique of capitalizing on small price changes. Scalping crypto means to scalp spot or derivative crypto markets.\n\n\nScalping positions are typically closed as soon as they become profitable, earning a profit in the neighborhood of 2%.\n\nThe best market structure for scalping\n\nFlat, sideways market that does not trend is the best market type for scalping.\n\nRegarding bitcoin, the year 2017 was the year to buy your crypto in January and hold. Then, maybe, if you felt like it, to trade the reaccumulation ranges and sell the right bounce to rebuy lower and carry on the Mr Bones’ wild ride.\n\nThat was swing trading. In a trending market, swing trading is the method with which you extract most of the available profits from the market.\n\nWith the end of the post-halving bull, the profitability of this trading style it came to an end too.\n\nAll through 2018 and in 2019, the first most obvious thing crypto investors noticed is that everyone’s long-term stacks keep losing their dollar value.\n\nThe best crypto for scalping\n\nTo run a scalping strategy, you need a cryptocurrency that is capable of forming ranges. A coin with markets mature enough to go properly sideways is the best crypto for scalping.\n\nIf you are an alt coin trader who likes to speculate on smaller, new cryptocurrencies, you will miss most of your profits if you try to scalp those markets.\n\nSmall-cap altcoins are trending as long as they are quite new. After the inevitable hype period, they will most often go bust.\n\nThe bottom period there is where you could, in theory, scalp them as the market is flat.\n\nPractically though that will not go well because nobody is trading failed alts. The market will be too thin to take your orders and it will be hard to get your orders filled.\n\nFor these reasons it is best to stick to large-cap cryptos like BTC or ETH for your scalping.\n\nCrypto Scalping Tools\n\n\n  We have a 101 guide on how to start automated trading crypto, including crypto scalping automation. There are platforms that do not require any coding knowledge. Read here.\n\n\nBtw: You can scalp crypto with VPVR-like volume indicators on Cryptowatch Free plan. Read here\n\nCrypto scalping charting\n\nScalping requires a 5M or shorter timeframe chart. Footprint type of charts like Tensorcharts work extremely well.\n\nOn the chart, you will need indicators that work well on such short timeframes.\n\nBitcoin scalping indicators that work well\n\n\n  oscillators like StochRSI\n  inverse Fisher of RSI (also an oscillator)\n  Bollinger Bands^TM\n  basic support and resistance\n\n\nTechnical indicators that do not work well on short timeframes are Ichimoku cloud and divergences. These are indicators that work with trends and do not provide good information for the timespan of minutes.\n\nTrading platforms for crypto scalping\n\nYour requirements for trading platform good for scalping is stable web interface or API and reliable stop loss.\n\nAny scalping strategy relies on collecting a large number of small profits.\nFor this reason, a single losing trade can wipe out months of your work if your stop loss fails. In scalping, losers need to be cut quickly with a discipline.\n\nIf you are comfortable trading crypto options on Deribit, there are ways to use options instead of a stop loss.\n\nExchanges that generally do not crash during heavy load\n\n  Bitfinex (spot, leveraged spot, derivatives)\n  Deribit (options, futures)\n  Phemex (new spot and derivative exchange - not properly put through the FOMO fire yet)\n\n\nCrypto scalping bots\n\nThere is a couple of dedicated bots for scalping crypto in 2021, as well as platforms that let you build your own strategy with no coding knowledge required.\n\nAnd there’s a reason for it. Scalping is not for everybody. Most traders are most comfortable with swing trading, the quick switching of sides that scalping requires is heavy on your mind.\n\n\n\nCrypto bots and alerts useful for scalping strategies\n\n\n  Shrimpy (needs some coding knowledge, but has plenty tutorials and a dev community on Telegram)\n  Coinrule (zero coding knowledge required)\n  Tensorcharts (has programmable interface for custom alerts - helpful for manual scalping)\n\n\n\n\nCrypto Scalping Strategy - Scalping Setup Examples\n\nAs mentioned in the scalping bots section, the typical crypto scalping strategy is straightforward on paper but hard to pull off psychologically.\n\nTraders who are not used to taking losses are the best candidates for headaches from scalping.\n\nLosses are something that on the crypto markets can be pretty much avoided, as long as you stick to trading the big swings.\n\nYour scalping profit comes from large number of quick trades. Taking small losses is inevitable, but you must make sure the losses are really cut when they are still small. Otherwise months of your work can be wiped out at once.\n\nExample 1: Basic Support/Resistance Scalping Setup\n\n\n\nTools:\n\n  Chart with 30M and 5M support and resistance\n\n\nLong Set Up:\n\n  Find 30M support level.\n  Post a long position at a the support level.\n  Find nearest resistance level to the upside.\n  Post a take-profit and stop-loss in the 1:1 ratio (or better), aiming for a 1-2% profit\n  Follow the market at 5M chart to confirm the price action is slowing down around your order.\n  If order triggers, follow the market on 5M and move your stop loss up as you gain unrealized profit.\n  Let your take-profit or stop-loss trigger.\n\n\nShort set up for this scalping strategy is equivalent.\n\nVariations:\n\n  Use Bollinger bands as boundaries for support and resistance\n  Use volume profile or VPVR to find support and resistance\n  Use TensorCharts orderbook heatmap to find support and resistance\n\n\nAutomate this scalping strategy\n\nExample 2: Scalping a bull flag\n\n\n\nTools:\n\n  Chart of 5M market that is making new (intermittent) highs.\n  Best starting position is high-volume break through (short-term) resistance level.\n\n\nBull flag scalping set up:\n\n  Find a break through a resistance or a similar high-probability short term bullish point.\n  Work out the nearest resistance to the north. If this is an all-time high, use a fib extension.\n  Open a long. You may need to use an instant market order if the market is running away.\n  Set up your stop loss at the ratio of 1:1 or better compared to your expected resistance.\n  Move your stop loss up as the price moves up.\n  As the price approaches resistance, move your stop loss closer to the price: The middle of the previous candle. Keep moving the stop loss as new candles are generated.\n  Let your stop loss trigger.\n  Open a short.\n  Work out a support level for the retracement. Fibs are a good tool for that.\n  Set up your stop loss at the ratio of 1:1 or better.\n  Move your stop loss down as the price moves down.\n  As the price approaches support, move your stop loss closer to the price: The middle of the previous candle. Keep moving the stop loss as new candles are generated.\n  Let your stop loss trigger.\n\n\nTypically, a bull flag will have two bottoms. You can trade the first bounce the same way.\n\nExperiment with the stop-loss levels, on different markets different levels will be appropriate. It might seem like a way to minimise your risk by setting stop loss to the previous candle right from the start. The reason it’s kept loose like this is the notorious stop hunts on most crypto markets.\n\nAutomate this scalping strategy\n\nUsing Tensorcharts as your cryptocurrency scalping tool\n\n\n  \n\n\nSo far the best charting app for short-term crypto trades is TensorCharts.\n\nThe information you get when watching TensorCharts is far more complete than the averaged-out information you get from the standard candlesticks charts, and in scalping that matters a lot.\n\nTensorCharts Tools for Scalping\n\n  Order flow, or “Colored candles” - See at which price level of the candle happened the largest buying or selling activity.\n  Orderbook heatmap - See where traders put their orders, and if they mean to spoof them or let them execute.\n  Book counter and trades counter - At which side of the orderbook is currently the most pressure.\n\n\nThe disadvantage of TensorCharts is the learning curve. You will need to take some time and learn to use TensorCharts. Once you’ve done that, you will have a powerful tool at your hands and quite an edge - because not too many other traders will bother.\n\nWe have a brief intro to the TensorCharts project here and a list of Tensorcharts tutorials from YouTube and elsewhere.\n\nStart with TensorCharts FREE\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary\n\nWhy scalping crypto matters?\n\nMost traders will stop trading during sideways and negative price actions.\n\nYour typical crypto trader will get frustrated as the price keeps going down and he “cannot do anything” (?), he’ll lose sleep, obsess over looking for the bounce and eventually sells the bottom.\n\nAs a result, even the biggest crypto markets get thinner and easier to shake.\n\nThis also invites the trolls and shills to shout around that cryptocurrencies are dying for real this time which can easily spiral into more panic.\n\nGood thing that all this is also a trading opportunity for everyone who wants to take it.\n\nThere is still money on the table, why not collect it then?\n\n\nCryptocurrency trading strategy: Scalping Crypto with Tensorcharts (PDF)\nToo long to read now?

      content: "In this Trading Strategy:\n\n\n  On the 2021 NFT arts market\n    \n      by a marketer\n      by a consultant\n      by an artist\n    \n  \n  On the three reasonable NFT trading strategies\n\n\nWhat else we wrote on NFT trading:\n\n  101 - Basic checklist before you invest in an NFT as a newbie\n  201 - NFT markets, open and closed: Where is the value?\n\n\n\n\nNFT art, the high-tech iteration of Rare Pepe trading of 2016.\n\nYou have definitely heard if not about NFTs, then surely about the money some people extract out of that market.\n\nJust by a quick glance at my Twitter feed, I am sure there's plenty folks out there ready to convince me that NFTs are the future of human civilization. And clearly even more of those who care only as far as there's a quick buck to make.\n\nThat made me curious. Would I be able to get the account of someone with a more practical point of view at all? Best case, somebody who isn't primarily a crypto enthusiast?\n\nI tapped into my underground connections in second class countries (including France) and searched among people who are not public about their engagement with cryptocurrencies and the related community.\n\nI found plenty. Willing to give anonymous accounts, so this article cannot be taken for more than an anecdote.\n\nStill - if you don't give a flying f about NFTs, like I don't, keep reading. You're in a good position.\n\n\n\nNFTs are the new ICOs, art curators are the new shitcoin shills\n\nOne of the most detailed accounts I got was from the marketing director of an IT hardware company.\n\nThat was also one of the most surprising types of business to get involved in NFTs.\n\nNo apparent relation to crypto and no reasonable use case for cryptocurrency tokens or blockchain – well, that aspect is not new. But at the same time we are talking about a long established company that develops privacy-focused hardware used in corporate infrastructures, not some sort of vaporware.\n\n,,It's because our marketing was in shambles for the past 10 years right up until 2020, to be honest,\" explained the marketing director who only started working with the company in 2019. ,,All our main competitors took contracts with the big telecom providers and grew. So even though we've got better privacy and almost none of our components are sourced in China, we got stuck as the local company that sells tech to Raspberry Pie geeks in the neighborhood. Nobody knows us.\"\n\nThe company stayed afloat for so long only by being on life support by its sister business, in exchange for some control. Out of which is now our hardware company trying to escape. To do that, they need to build up liquidity - in any possible way.\n\nTurns out the CEO did his market research. In private, he made plenty of smaller flips at Opensea in the past months but only recently he celebrated his first big NFT art sale. He had bought the art for 2 ETH and sold for 80. ,,It was a …Rare monkey or something? I'm not sure,\" the marketer says.\n\nThe company commissioned a freelancer who is building NFTs of all of their geekiest products. They have spent almost half a year building an engaged online community of their geeky retail userbase and now their plan is to sell the collectibles to these guys.\n\nAs for the NFTs, the marketer is not yet sure what functionalities to build into them. The company is consulting that with an art broker. But all in all, the director says, they are betting on the hype. ,,We just noticed there is a lot of overlap between the crypto community and our retail clients. Or even with our engineering team, to be honest. That means everyone even internally is aboard with the idea, you know how rare that is? We've got to make use of that.\"\n\nIt would have been more to my taste to get the Fight Club's corporate sponsorship, but as the marketer promptly explained, that is extremely hard to achieve without any strings attached.\n\nNobody in business wants to make a deal where they are pulling the shorter side of the rope.\n\nTherefore, the best solution is doing it like ICOs did it, before they got regulated and problematic: Get the money piece by piece, from your retail spenders.\n\nSome may be in it for profit, but a lot of them will spend out of loyalty, out of boredom or just because someone told them to and it's not that much money anyway. The last one is especially relevant now when you can buy fraction of an NFT art.\n\nThe marketer sent me an Instagram reel by the art broker they are hiring for consulting and promo. It's somebody who owns a small, no name gallery in the middle of nowhere and is now branching out to NFT art trading.\n\nIn the reel she's explaining that money in NFT art can be lost in copious amounts and crazy fast as well. What is the key to making profit? Buying NFT art connected with famous names, or NFT art recommended by experienced art curators.\n\nI wonder where we've heard that before.\n\n\n\nCorporates learned to speak buzz\n\nContrary to my expectations, once again, the fintech space is not really into all the innovation – at least according to the account I got.\n\nThe person I spoke to was carrying one of the fancy startup job titles, which pretty much amounted to a consulting gig with a regular payroll.\n\nHe was openly disillusioned that after five years of making empty ICO promises, the fintech industry is still not moving on to actually start doing something. Instead, they now got a fresh thing to make promises about – the NFTs.\n\n,,ICOs, tokenization and blockchain tech were just buzz words to get funding from small-ish businesses in the finance industry. I can only speak in general, but the mental twist that convinced them was that they are small anyway and have little to lose. But if they invest in positioning their company in a nascent innovative industry while that's still easy, they could possibly be the behemoth one day.\"\n\nSounds reasonable, on the face of it, but the reality of the actual work was a bit of a bore.\n\n,,It was a lot of money on some pretty vague terms. I mean, I really can't complain. But I just pretty much spent my days scrolling through the same Coindesk articles as any unemployed Redditor.\"\n\nCheapskate companies with high ambitions will surely drop some good money on vague terms in the name on NFTs too. Nothing wrong with that, at all.\n\n\n\nBut who are the creators in the NFT space?\n\nYou have heard the names: CryptoPunk, Beeple, Gromes. This is all native, digital-first NFT art though.\n\nIf art curators and art brokers from the world of physical art branch out to dealing with NFTs, how about traditional artists? Are they moving on to NFT art or not?\n\nI interviewed a friend who is an artist and and an artists' mentor, known and active in that community. Coincidentally also a crypto investor since pre-Gox, but this facet of his life is less of a public knowledge.\n\nHe assured me there is a lot of interest among some artists, but generally the NFT art community is separated from anything legacy.\n\nI wanted to know more about the NFT people. What is the community like? Is it an actual community or just a group of fanbois who congratulate each other on being early? Just what kind of people is it?\n\nHere my artsy friend started dodging the responses right away.\n\nYou've got a community like any other community, there's a lot of people who are just trying new things to keep up with the trends, there are the scammers, there are the business men, hard to generalize yada yada.\n\nClearly I wasn't going to learn much here, so I tried to approach the same question indirectly.\n\nWhat is the community is looking at for the future? Surely they do not plan to stick with collectibles?\n\nHere he came alive a bit. ,,Collectibles are pretty good in fact. Especially when it's something that's purely digital. Do you know how much are people willing to pay for their own rare NFT that commemorates an event in history that is important to them? I'm talking merch of their favorite football club. You can digitize the moment their favorite football player scored the winning goal in a world cup and make it a limited NFT. There's so much money to make on auctioning historical moments, like you wouldn't believe.\"\n\nIt sounds fair enough, and you've got to make the money somewhere.\n\nBut if the value rests on the record of a historical event, or on a name of a club or any other brand, then the NFT space better get some pretty dire intellectual property regulations. How else would you keep your NFTs unique and rare?\n\nWith original art, this problem doesn't exist because original artworks are always unique. Wasn't this meant to be the point?\n\nWith this my art friend agreed. ,,And you can bet the NFT art trade is going to blow up much more than the trade with physical art. It's the ease of use that does it.\"\n\nThe key point in his expectation rests on the same principle that underpins the OG bitcoin meme about a Swiss bank account in your pocket.\n\nAccording to him, the purpose of some part of fine art transactions has always been the following thing: You need to transfer 1,500,900 USD to someone, but for some reason you cannot leave a paper trail for that transaction.\n\nGetting that money in cash and stuffing a pizza box with it would be fair enough for the actual delivery of the money, but then again you would need to explain the withdrawal of 1,500,900 USD to your banking institution.\n\nSo then, why not buy a piece of art worth 1,500,900 USD and let a skillful art operator take care of the rest? There is a paper trail that is completely legitimate, but as for its true nature, that part is pseudonymous.\n\n“If the art can be digital, making the transaction even smoother and more streamlined, then so much the better,” he explained.\n\nTo this I only had one question: In the traditional fine arts, there is an enormous amount of people – artists, businessmen and enthusiasts alike - who take arts and the related art industry dead seriously.\n\nIt is either the meaning of their life, or it makes their life suck less. Their sense of personal identity is built around it. They live through it.\n\nYou need these people to hold the market together. Only then the means-to-an-end transactions can mix in and do their job.\n\nSo, is there this group of genuine people, really deeply dedicated to the cause of NFT art?\n\nMy friend hesitates. ,,Not yet,\" he admits. ,,But it will happen. NFT *is* real art. Like, there is no reason why NFT art should *not* get to the same level as physical art. No reason at all.\"\n\nThere is not. But as some of us know, having good odds is not yet the same as having the win in your pocket.\n\n\n\nOn the NFT trading strategies\n\nNFT arts are an interesting market. More interesting for short term traders and possibly even more interesting for marketers, agencies and social media influencers.\n\nMarketing &amp; Co\n\nThe bagholding risk is higher than with fungible crypto here. If you're stuck with an alt coin through a drawdown, there is usually some chance the project will change leadership or strategy, the market will pick up and you will make it out.\n\nNFTs are minted by few pieces only with nothing to plan for their future other than being sold and bought for art or speculation, so they are closer to crypto binary options in this sense. They can be actually worthless forever.\n\nAs a paid shill you carry the best risk/reward ratio – you only receive the money, standing no cash to lose.\n\nShills only stand to lose their reputation, if at all. Does that still count as speculation?\n\nAnyway, since NFTs are hyped up, you would be stupid not to charge hyped up fees too. The opportunity here is better than in regular social media work.\n\nShort term trading\n\nAs a trader, right now there's not much to talk about other than buying as cheap as you can and selling as dear as you'll manage.\n\nYou can very safely assume that the point of the majority of the participants is either to sell it again or to keep it for sentimental value. You should work with that rationale.\n\n\n  Find the floor value of the NFT and buy around it.\n  The price of a token goes up on mentions at social media.\n  The potential valuation of a token grows with the size of the audience that might like it.\n\n\nSince this is pretty much a one trick pony market, at least just now, your first thought should be how to automate your flipping workflow.\n\n\n\nAnd you won't be the first one, but you will still be early.\n\nLong term trading\n\nThis one is the riskiest at this stage of the NFT market. There is so much NFT art out there, all of it looks pretty much random to the outsider, hard to judge what will people like in the long run when the effect of shilling and hype vanishes.\n\nAnd then, will the digital art space catch on at all? It may and it may not.\n\nYou will either end up with a real valuable collectors' item, or with a worthless piece of code and there is not much about it that you could personally control.\n\nYou can do something. Some physical art collectors create unofficial Instagram \"fan\" accounts for the art they own. They post photos loaded with hashtags to generate exposure for the artist's name. With consistency over  a long time this does increase the price of their collection.\n\nBut nobody will manage to stay on this unless this is something they really enjoy doing.\n\nIf you want to spend your time on this, I guess I'll just say all power to you.\n\nWhat else we wrote on NFT trading:\n\n  101 - Basic checklist before you invest in an NFT as a newbie\n  201 - NFT markets, open and closed: Where is the value?\n\n",

      content: "VPVR is short for Volume Profile Visible Range, a popular volume trading tool. VPVR paints a histogram of traded volume at each price level for as much of the past price action as you can see in your current chart window.\n\nThere is a lot of content on volume trading in crypto on AltcoinTrading.NET.\n\n\n  Glossary entry on basics of volume trading\n  ScriptSpotlight for free volume profile scripts on TradingView\n\n\nI am going to repeat some of the information from those here, to save you a click. If you are already familiar with volume profiles, just skip to the sections that interest you.\n\nIn this trading strategy:\n\n\n  Where to trade VPVR: Charting platforms that give free versions of VPVR\n    \n      Cryptowatch for visible range profile\n      TradingView for fixed range profile\n    \n  \n  How to read VPVR indicator\n  Best manual volume profile trading strategies:\n    \n      VPVR Trading Strategies\n      Fixed Range Profile Trading Strategies\n    \n  \n  How to automate volume trading and volume profile trading\n    \n      FTX Quant Zone example\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nPlatforms for VPVR trading\n\nVPVR, Volume Profile Visible Range, used to be a strictly premium technical indicator. Since 2021 you can get a very good equivalent of VPVR for free on Cryptowatch.\n\nCryptowatch is also the only charting app where you can directly on VPVR from the same chart. You just need to import your exchange keys into Cryptowatch.\n\nHere’s how to find the VPVR on there:\n\n\n\nIf you don’t want to use Cryptowatch, TradingView has a bunch of good volume profile alternatives. They are all fixed range, but those may be actually easier to trade on. If you trade on 3H chart or shorter, you will make a good use of daily fixed range volume profile (that is, one volume profile for one trading day).\n\nHere’s a link to a good free volume profile daily fixed range on TradingView:\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to read volume profile\n\n\n\nFrom our glossary:\n\nReading VPVR boils down to two three things:\n\n\n  \n    Find the price with the highest traded volume.\n\n    This brings you close to identifying areas of supply and demand, and therefore your support and resistance. The VPVR histogram will get highlighted through this part - the value area.\n\n    The highest volume price level is called the volume point of control, or VPOC.\n  \n  \n    Find the gaps.\n\n    The “filling of the gap” is infamous, especially in crypto.\n\n    Still, if price didn’t stay somewhere for very long, than that area might have been covered in an irrational speculative run.\n  \n  \n    Make sure you are not looking at bogus data.\n\n    Both fixed range and visible range volume profile lets you roll back through the market history. This is especially bad if you want to trade on volume profile patterns: They are dangerous as depending on where you stop, you will get varying degrees of bullshit.\n\n    Visible range volume profiles are a much safer tool for traders who actually watch the charts during the day. This way the trader knows how the volume profile developed, and possibly made some notes about it into the chart.\n\n    If you don’t want to watch the charts all day, use a fixed range volume profile, but stick to a specific range. The best range to choose is daily - here’s once again the daily volume profile script from TradingView.\n\n    As a note, daily volume profile also can be used as a simplified tool for market profile analysis.\n  \n\n\n\n\nBest Manual Volume Profile Fixed Range Trading Strategies\n\n\n\nFix range volume profile trading is good for day traders. It will also work for anyone who speculates short-term on alt coin markets but does not want to get stuck holding the alt coin.\n\nUsing fixed range volume profile, you can best make the use of the regularities in daily trading activity.\n\nSet your range to daily (like with this free one on TradingView shown on the picture above) and trade on the comparison between today’s prices vs yesterday’s high volume prices.\n\nComparing today’s and yesterday’s price action compares how the mood on the market changed between the two days.\n\n• No intricate patterns are needed to trade on fix range volume, you are simply comparing today’s value area with the previous day’s value area.\n\n• You may use other technical indicators for your entry: MACD, EMA or ALMA, RSI and its transformations, support and resistance.\n\n• This is short-term trading, so set your stop losses and and close rather too early than too late.\n\nAs a technical note, you will need to trade on the 1H chart or shorter: Considering these are daily volume profiles, you won’t even get to see much on anything over 3H or 4H.\n\nFixed Volume Profile, 1D Range, Bullish Strategy\n\nThe day is setting up for a bullish opportunity if the daily trading starts off above the previous day’s value area, but ideally not fully above the full profile.\n\nThis shows that there is a lot of demand driving the price up, but it’s not a full on FOMO.\n\nThere will most likely be an attack at a new high. The strategy is to wait for a retracement from that and buy there.\n\nHere’s what it looks like. This is from LUNAUSD, 1H:\n\n\n\nYou probably know that retracements and flags usually have two bottoms, but thanks to your volume profile you also know the market is showing strength, so it is better to not wait for the second one as it might not actually paint.\n\n• Yesterday’s value area is your stop loss.\n\n• Move your stop loss into breakeven and then into profit as soon as possible.\n\n• You will want to get out on the next top, either by closing or by having your stop triggered.\n\nFixed Volume Profile, 1D Range, Bearish Strategy\n\nAnalogous to the bull case, the day is setting up for a bearish opportunity if the daily trading starts off below the previous day’s value area, but ideally not fully crashing.\n\nIf the price retraces upwards to the previous day’s value area, and is rejected, that is a short setup.\n\nAgain, use a stop loss - at the old resistance and shift it down. You might want to watch your favourite oscillating indicators to see if they reset (for instance, stoch RSI or iF RSI) or just take profit near the next support level.\n\nHere’s what the setup looks like on LUNAUSD (1H):\n\n\n\nAlways be mindful of the overall trend on the market, as you can see from the picture above.\n\nOn this snapshot, LUNA is firmly trending bullish. If you short it, you need to make sure you’ll be able to get out quick to keep your profits. Use a market stop.\n\n\n\nBest Manual Volume Profile Visible Range Trading Strategies\n\n\n\nVisible range volume profile histogram shows the traded volume per price level for as far back as the market goes in your chart window. This information is completely fluid, it accumulates over time, so it doesn’t make much sense to look for patterns within it.\n\nVPVR is great for seeing support and resistance levels at the first glance. Because it accumulates, it will give you the high volume areas from previous flags and ranges too, as long as they are visible in your chart window.\n\nYou can use this information for scalping and for swing trading, because in both these styles you need to work with support and resistance levels.\n\n\n  The support and resistance provided by VPVR is based on past data, and will always be good for your entries.\n  Depending on where the market is trending, there may or may not not be enough information via VPVR to anticipate your exit.\n  If the market is running above ATH, there’s no history to get resistance information from. In this case, use Fibonacci extension (there’s an AutoFib script on TradingView that paints them for you) and orderbook visualisation to see where people stack orders - Tensorcharts do that.\n\n\nVPVR Indicator Support &amp; Resistance Analysis\n\nThis is what suppport and resistance analysis with VPVR looks like on SOLUSD on FTX. Here is a 4H chart that uses only VPVR and stoch-RSI oscillator to get the “oversold” or “overbought” information.\n\nYou would use this sort of timeframe for swing trading, but if you are a scalper, the same workflow answers on 5-30M charts.\n\n\n\n• There is a lot of support accumulated over the current range, and then further down from the long period around 20-50 USD (not shown here).\n\n• 1D RSI shows the last rally only made a lower high and didn’t overcome the value area of the range, all the while making the RSI shoot up towards “overbought”: This is a sign of weakness and mid-term bearish.\n\n\n\nIf you are looking for a speculation, in this scenario you will be better off moving on to some other alt coin - one that shows strength. You will be able to pull off speculative trades faster and with less stress there.\n\nIf you want to hold Solana on the other hand, this would be a time to give the market more attention.\n\n• Trading on 1D, pay attention to fundamentals. Solana is tied with NFTs, so find out how the fundamentals there are looking currently: The chart being from December 2021, consider the ETH network upgrades in 2021. Will the hype around Solana’s slowly disappear? Or is there a case for accumulating?\n\n• Set up alerts for the value area. If the market falls on good volume below the value area of the range, that’s bearish. You would use the Wyckoff method for ranges here.\n\n\n\nHow to automate volume profile trading\n\n\n\nYou will have a hard time automating trading with VPVR due to the fluid nature of the indicator.\n\nIf you want to automate your volume trading, you will be better off using either a fixed range volume profile, or sticking to the more standard volume tools like OBV (on-balance volume).\n\nVPVR, or its cheaper equivalents, are good as long as you are willing to sit at the charts watching the volume indicator develop.\n\nYou can in theory automate the setups with a fixed range volume profile as described in this section. But so far, neither Shrimpy nor Coinrule auto-trading platform supports volume profiles.\n\nYou would have to implement a simplified version of a fix-range daily volume profile yourself. Here’s a list of reasonable simplifications:\n\n\n  You only need to get the VPOC, not the full volume profile. The basic strategies just need the highest volume price over the whole trading day.\n  Other than that you need the daily low and the daily high, which is a standard information in any daily OHLC data.\n  The trigger is a rejection from the value area. Since you don’t have a value area, just the point-of-control, you would use statistics: Give it some percentage leeway.\n  Don’t forget a trailing stop.\n\n\n\n\nAutomating simpler volume trading\n\nWorking with simpler volume tools is straightforward to automate, though.\n\nA derisking example: Set up a rule at FTX Quant Zone to submit a sell order when price stays below a known resistance without breaching it, and at the same time daily traded volume rises over a certain value. This kind of scenario would possibly indicate that there is an increasing amount of selling and the market is about to top.\n\nYou the resistance could be an ATH, but it could also be an older value area - depends on what the market looks like.\n\nJust note that this strategy is a better fit for larger cryptos that trade in ranges (BTC, ETH), not for newer alts that peak faster as traders bail on them easily.\n\nHere is how to do a very basic setup in FTX Quant Zone (Refine it and DYOR, please!):\n\n\n\n\n  Let’s suppose we are ranging up around ETH’s all time high area around $4790. You do not think that this is the top, but you do not want to hold ETH through a drawdown.\n  So, let’s set up the condition for a price getting somewhat below the resistance. Refine this number by looking at the candle patterns around the top.\n  Now let’s work out the volume requirement: Price needs to drop, but on volume. In this example, the second bracket requires volume in the last 60 minutes ((base_volume(\"ETH/USD\", 60)) to be higher than the average hourly volume over the past 24 hours ((base_volume(\"ETH/USD\")/12))\n  You can make the volume condition stronger or weaker: &gt; (base_volume(\"ETH/USD\")/6) will let pass only volumes of more than double the average.\n  Set the action. In this example I set it to open an ETH perp short. This could be a hedge. Instead of that you could just deposit ETH and set it to be sold on spot though - that would make it a take-profit trade.\n\n\nYou will need to add further refinements to the condition to verify that the market is actually less and less likely to breach the resistance. Look around the FTX Quant zone, they have enough operators and some simple statistics built in.\n\nSummary\n\nBy way of summary, here’s the list of tools and platforms mentioned in this article.\n\n\n  Free volume profile daily fixed range on TradingView\n  Free VPVR on Cryptowatch\n  AutoFib script on TradingView\n  Tensorcharts orderbook heatmap\n  FTX Quant Zone\n  Shrimpy\n  Coinrule\n\n",

      title: "Shadow System Scalping - Simplified Grid Trading: Does it work in crypto?",
      content: "Shadow system definition\n\n\n  The shadow system is a grid trading system developed originally for forex. It is a statistical method that forms the backbone of successful scalping strategies. Like with any grid, the basic tenets of the Shadow System are “buy low, sell high”. Duh.\n\n\nWhy a “shadow” system\n\nThe name itself gives a hint: The shadow system is based on price action and perception, not on indicators or historical data.\n\nThere is no numeric value which you watch constantly - but there are “shadows”, or patterns which you will learn to recognize.\n\nThis is the key difference to all other approaches, which are based on indicators or an own developed system of rules - shadow system is flexible and agnostic with regard to all this.\n\nShadow system is being used with basic 1D candlestick charts which are familiar to anyone who reads this website.\n\nIf you are interested, here is the original Shadow System post still available on Forex Factory.\n\nWhat is the theory behind the shadow trading grid?\n\n\n  Every day, crypto prices go up and down. There is an open price, a high, and a low every day - the close is the same as next day’s open.\n  It is rare that the open price is also the high or low of the day.\n  Additionally, the daily price action goes very rarely only in a single one direction.\n\n\nIn forex, single-direction days occurs only 1% or less of the time.\n\nCrypto trades differently, but it still holds that the single direction days only happen rarely.\n\nYou will have noticed that if you trade with 1D fixed volume profiles.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Single direction trading days are rare.\n\nUsually, there is a “shadow”, or tail, from the open to the high or low of the day. This means that almost every day, there is some action on both sides of the open price.\n\nThe Shadow system takes advantage of the small shadow that exists between the open price and the high or low of the day, and scalps a fixed amount of that movement every day.\n\nIt is a low-risk (with stops), high-probability mechanical scalping system that in its most basic form disregards trends, indicators, interest calculations, and so on. The only factors that count in this system are daily price action and odds.\n\nThe Setup: Running the Shadow System\n\nThe setup:\n\n\n  Enter market at open. Start with the direction that has higher probability in your current market.\n  Set your take profit and stop. If you use a regular stop, you might have it moved into profit when possible.\n  Once either take profit or stop are hit, reverse the trade direction. Again use take profit and stop loss.\n  If you end up with an open position that did not trigger any order, close it near the end of the trading day.\n  Rinse and repeat….(Or, you know, maybe a bot could do that)\n\n\nThe tools:\n\nYou can trade on this directly from any exchange as there’s no TA-heavy charting involved.\n\nAs for automation - This is a rigid scalping strategy, so unless you’re already using a third-party trading bot like Coinrule, there’s no need to buy one. This can be automated using the FTX Quant Zone. See the grid bot article for templates and recipes.\n\nDoes it work?\n\nSo, before I dump the numbers and spreadsheets on you:\n\nIs the shadow grid actually profitable in crypto?\n\nThe answer is yes, but it is less profitable than in forex.\n\nThe Data: How well does it work?\n\nHere is the best-case scenario from my backtest of the shadow system on the ETHUSD pair.\n\n\n  The shadow system works with take-profit orders in fixed USD distance from the open price. (More on that in the next section.)\n  Using the original take-profit formula made for forex, you only get your take-profit filled in ~65% of your trades. (Figure 2: First row) In forex, the rate tends to be over 70% for both sides.\n  If you try to set your take profit smaller, you get right more often, but the total profit will be lower - because you are taking smaller profits. (Figure 2: Second and third row)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Best-case scenario of ETHUSD (2021-22 OHL data)\n\nThe red notes on the right side signify that this is the best possible monthly profit. It assumes that you never get stopped out.\n\nI didn’t backtest how many times you would actually get stopped out on the same dataset, so what comes next is for illustration only.\n\nObviously, a lot depends on how loose your stop loss will be. I think we all agree that not setting any stop loss in crypto is a bad idea. But some traders like to set up only a catastrophic stop loss - quite loose - while others like to trail their positions with tight stop losses.\n\n50/50 for a realistic illustration\n\nAnyway, to test out some more realistic outcomes, I used the common risk-reward ratios - 1:1, 1:2, 1:3 - and got the worst-case scenarios.\n\nThe worst-case scenario assumes that you will be stopped out every day twice (on your long  and on your short).\n\nSo, the real monthly profit will lay somewhere between the best case and the worst case.\n\nTo illustrate that assumption, I calculated the hypothetical profit for a 50/50 case: You get stopped out in half of the trades.\n\nI got comparable results on ETHUSD as well as on BTCUSD:\n\n\n  The 50/50 shadow grid is not profitable for 1:1 risk-reward ratio. In forex, it is plenty profitable even with that R/R, but not in crypto.\n  The 50/50 profits for 1:2 and 1:3 risk-reward setups are between 9-19% a month on the fiat pairs.\n  The ETHBTC ratio had worse results than the fiat-based markets.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Worst-case and 50/50 data for ETHUSD Shadow grid (2021-22 OHL data)\n\nSo, it is not bad for something you can automate but it’s not like it’s going to make you a life-changing amount of money if you trade with 50 bucks.\n\nIf at least some crypto markets will over time get more rangey and crabby as their regular way, then the expectation is that the shadow grid will get more profitable in the years to come.\n\n\n\nThe Works: Setting up your shadow grid\n\nIn the original shadow scalping system, you work with take-profit orders.\n\nTo know where to set your take profit, the shadow system doesn’t use technical indicators. It works with the average daily difference between the daily highs and daily lows.\n\nTo get the daily data on your market of choice, you can get the 1D OHL CSV for free on Nasdaq Data, formerly known as Quandl.\n\nI backtested the BTCUSD, ETHUSD and ETHBTC markets, getting the historical Bitfinex daily OHL data for Excel.\n\n\n  \n    Relative vs absolute values\n\n    Right off, I’ll say that for simplicity’s sake I’m using the absolute base currency values in this post. All amplitudes and price differences of ETHUSD and BTCUSD datasets are calculated in plain USD. I am using only recent 2021 data, where prices kept an even level.\n\n    You should at least test the relative values, but I will explain the problem that happens in crypto.\n\n    What I tested:\n    \n      price differences relative to that day’s close\n      price differences relative to that day’s middle\n      price differences relative to that day’s open\n      price differences relative to the average close over the whole period\n    \n\n    On 2021 BTCUSD data as well as on the full dataset since 2014, the best results came from prices divided by the daily close. The thing is, even with prices divided by daily close, the daily take-profit target calculated from the amplitude became much smaller, which made for an overall smaller monthly profit.\n\n    Using relative values over a recent range (2021 only) gave the best results…At least on paper. The maximum expected profit over 30 days was about 2.3% better than what gave the setup with plain dollar prices.\n\n    Now, for the actual formulas.\n  \n  \n    Daily amplitude\n\n    For each market, you first determine the average daily amplitude, which is calculated as half of high-low range for the day.\n\n    \n\n    Daily amplitude tells us on average how much the price moves into extremes each day.\n\n    From how much data do you calculate the amplitude?\n\n    Well, the daily amplitude will make your take-profit target for each day, so in forex you would naturally want to calculate it from as much data as possible.\n\n    In crypto, you will need to use some sense. Cryptocurrencies have appreciated too much over the years that you will probably not get good data applying on today’s market data from prehistoric times when 1 BTC was 300 USD.\n\n    In this strategy post I’m using only data from 2021 when the price was at a similar level as in the time of writing.\n  \n  \n    Daily profit target\n\n    Your daily profit target is half of the average daily amplitude according to the original shadow grid formula for forex. (It is half of the amplitude because tHaT’s WhErE iT gIvEs rEsUltS. Welcome to scientific trading.)\n\n    As already mentioned once above, you can make the take-profit smaller and be right more often, but in this case that leads to smaller monthly profit overall.\n\n    \n  \n  \n    Verify that the system makes sense\n\n    You should always compare the value of the amplitude with the average values for open-high, open-low, and open-close ranges.\n\n    The amplitude should not be too far from the average absolute value of all three of those ranges.\n\n    \n\n    If the ranges mutually differ a lot, it means the market is not a good fit for the basic shadow system strategy without the use of technical indicators. You will probably have better results by trading a trending grid there, or using some other technical setup.\n  \n  \n    Backtesting the shadow grid\n\n    The idea behind shadow system is sound, but the 1 BTC question is whether it is profitable. With a rigid grid system like this, it’s not too difficult to backtest the extreme outcomes using the the OHL datasets that you already have.\n\n    So, by now you have a daily profit target distance that seems to make sense.\n\n    In the shadow grid system, you will use it to take profits at that distance from the daily open price.\n\n    \n      On ETHUSD, we came up with a profit target of about 55 USD.\n      The daily long side take-profit order will be set at open price + 55\n      The daily short side take-profit order will be set at open price - 55\n    \n\n    To backtest the system, you want to take the distance of the open vs the extremes of your market - your daily high and low - and count how often they will cover your calculated profit target.\n\n    To get this in Excel, count the days where the open-high distance …\n \n\n    …is a higher absolute number than take profit distance.\n\n    \n\n    That’s how you get the statistical percentage for how often your shorts and your longs will be hit.\n\n    If at least one of the sides comes at above 50%, you have the theoretical odds. In sideways ranging markets both sides should be over 50%.\n\n    \n  \n  \n    Find out the monthly profit and loss extremes\n\n    The best case scenario assumes you make the value of your profit target twice every day.\n\n    The worst case scenario assumes you lose the value of your risked amount twice every day.\n\n    \n      In the 1:1 setup, you risk the same amount as is your profit target.\n      In 1:2 setup, you risk half of your profit target.\n    \n\n    And that’s it for your basic backtest of the shadow grid.\n  \n\n\nShould you run it?\n\nIf you can automate it, it might be worth a shot for prolonged ranges and bear markets.\n\nThe real profitability of the shadow grid in crypto is a matter of stop loss management, which is the usual way for scalping setups as you’re only taking small profits. A good stop loss placement is harder to backtest, but your overall profit is bound to improve with it.\n\nObviously this is not a strategy for trending markets.\n\nLastly, I know that technical traders probably wouldn’t gravitate towards a strategy like this.\n\n\n  If you already have a favourite indicator or a TradingView script on which you trade, the best way to see if you’re missing out is to backtest your profits from that script and see if you can make up to 19% a month on that.\n\n\nIf the main thing that interests you on the shadow system is the fact that it can be easily automated, then good news - so can TA.\n\n\n  It’s easy to automate TA trading on a TradingView script if you have TradingView premium and Coinrule premium - here’s how. And that strategy will probably be more profitable than the shadow system in its basic form as it’s shown here.\n\n\nBut if you don’t trust technical analysis and are willing to do some tuning, then the shadow grid might just work fine for you.\n\nWhat cryptocurrencies are best for shadow scalping?\n\nIf you do want to run this, here’s the market selection note before we end this post.\n\nTo trade the shadow grid, you need a crypto market with high intraday volatility - but not an extreme one.\n\nBasically, the list of pairs will be the same as for the best coins for a grid bot: Decent liquidity, capable of ranging, not hype-based.\n\n\n  BTCUSD\n  ETHUSD\n  ETHBTC\n\n\nObviously, the shadow system as any scalping strategy is good for ranging and crabbing markets.\n\nIn small alt coins, meme crypto and any market that is driven by “pump” sentiments, you are actually quite likely to get single direction days.\n\nFor intraday scalping, you need a market that moves a lot during the day, but in both directions.\n\nSummary\n\nThe shadow system is a scalping grid trading system that takes small profits in both directions every day. Right now, it is not as profitable in crypto as it is on the forex markets. But it is not a bad system for simple, easily automated trading that is not based on any technical analysis whatsoever.\n\nTools mentioned in this trading strategy:\n\n  TradingView\n  Coinrule\n  Nasdaq Data (Quandl)\n  Backtesting spreadsheet\n\n",

      title: "Crypto DCA: Complete Crypto DCA Strategy & Tools Guide (Updated)",
      content: "In this strategy, we’ll explain what is DCA and why you probably want to do that instead of hodl, if you are bullish on a cryptoasset.\n\nIn the second part of this strategy we’ll list the best exchanges that let you automate your DCA for free as well as commercial DCA bots.\n\nIf you want to jump around, here’s the table of contents:\n\n\n  The basics of DCA strategy\n  Why DCA beats HODL:\n    \n      Buy and hold profit estimate in 10 years\n      Projected DCA profits modelled as cycles of parabolic runs and crashes\n    \n  \n  Best exchanges for DCA, manual or automated\n  Automated DCA:\n    \n      On exchanges: FTX, Pionex, Independent Reserve\n      As standalone DCA bots: Coinrule, Bitsgap\n    \n  \n\n\nDollar Cost Averaging Definition\n\nWhat is DCA? In crypto or otherwise, DCA stands for dollar cost averaging, which is a trading technique that removes any short-term price speculation from your investing.\n\n\n  Dollar cost averaging, or DCA, means to invest a set amount of money into an asset in regular intervals, disregarding the price action.\n\n\nIt is key to understand that dollar cost averaging only removes the short-term price speculation. If you want to DCA, you need to be long-term bullish and expect that the asset you are buying will appreciate in time - otherwise, DCA-ing into it would make no sense.\n\nDollar Cost Averaging Strategy in Cryptocurrencies\n\nYou can dollar cost average into absolutely any investment asset just by purchasing some amount of it regularly - say, every week or every month.\n\nA monthly DCA into Bitcoin can look like this:\n\n\n  You decide to put 500 USD into Bitcoin monthly.\n  Every month on the day your salary arrives, you deposit 500 USD into a crypto exchange.\n  Once the deposit is credited, you log onto the exchange and immediately buy 500 USD worth of Bitcoin, come hell or high water.\n\n\nOr, you know, you can automate it.\n\nThe main point is to buy your DCA share of Bitcoin on the same day every month, regardless of the price action at that time.\n\nWhy DCA beats HODL\n\nIf your goal is most of all to get more crypto, then in the long run, doing DCA with skull-splitting regularity beats simple buy and hold.\n\nThe reason is that with DCA, you are putting additional money into your position in that asset. It may not seem like that but when you do the math, the additions add up over a few years. And then, adding money makes sense, since you are long-term bullish anyway.\n\nLet’s crunch the numbers.\n\nThe two tables below show the net worth of an investor who bought a stash of 5, 10 or 50 BTC at 20k or lower. 20k USD would be the standard bottom of the bear cycle in 2022. 90k USD is a reasonable target for the next bull cycle, I’m adding 135k for a more optimistic take as well.\n\nLong-Term HODL, No DCA\n\nIn this section, we’re mapping how the value of the stash rises when BTC appreciates.\n\n\n  \n    \n      [realistic] Long-Term Stash, No DCA\n       \n       \n       \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      BTCUSD Appreciation\n      From 20 000 USD to 90 000 USD\n       \n       \n    \n    \n      Stash\n      5\n      10\n      50\n    \n    \n      - Start Value\n      100 000 USD\n      200 000 USD\n      1 000 000 USD\n    \n    \n      - End Value\n      450 000 USD\n      900 000 USD\n      4 500 000 USD\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n      [optimistic] Long-Term Stash, No DCA\n       \n       \n       \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      BTCUSD Appreciation\n      From 20 000 USD to 135 000 USD\n       \n       \n    \n    \n      Stash\n      5\n      10\n      50\n    \n    \n      - Start Value\n      100 000  USD\n      200 000 USD\n      1 000 000 USD\n    \n    \n      - End Value\n      675 000  USD\n      1 350 000 USD\n      6 750 000  USD\n    \n  \n\n\nIf you start with a stash of 5 BTC, your best chance in the optimistic scenario is not even hitting a million. That is, ever. You could wait until next year or you could wait for 30 years.\n\nNow let’s throw monthly DCA into the mix.\n\nOne Decade of DCA\n\nTo compare the profits from buy and hold strategy with profits from dollar cost averaging, we need to have a model for future prices of crypto.\n\nI am using a fantasy bullish parabola that I got as the polynomial trend line for BTCUSD daily data from the start of 2018 until May 2022.\n\n\n\nFor an illustration of realistic DCA profitability, I modified the parabola that you see on the chart above.\n\n\n  It’s 2022 and crypto is trending down, so I shifted the DCA starting point to around 20k USD.\n  I kept the parabolic growth as shown, except every 30th month I crashed it down to about 45k USD.\n\n\nThis is not an unrealistic model - thus far, parabolic rises and prompt crashes have been the mainstay in crypto. Also, starting from 20k and having a deep crash every 30 months puts the final price after 10 years to about 135k USD. This would be more or less consistent with the history of the BTCUSD market, with projections based on technical analysis and with what the community considers achievable.\n\nI used this combination of parabolic growth and crash to work out how much bitcoin you will be able to afford each month for the same amount of fiat.\n\nTurns out that idle hodling means much lower profit for what already is a long-term bullish bias. Things get even juicier on a higher disposable income, as they usually do: At the DCA of 2500 USD monthly the projections for 10 years nearly doubles your final net worth when compared to buy and hold.\n\n\n  \n    \n      Monthly Bitcoin DCA: 10 years, from 20k to 135k\n       \n       \n       \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Disposable monthly income\n      1 000 USD\n      2 000 USD\n      2 500 USD\n    \n    \n      Initial “Buy &amp; Hold” purchase\n      5 BTC\n      5 BTC\n      5 BTC\n    \n    \n      Starting value at 20k\n      100 000 USD\n      100 000 USD\n      100 000 USD\n    \n    \n      Value without DCA at 135k\n      675 000 USD\n      675 000 USD\n      675 000 USD\n    \n    \n      Number of DCA purchases\n      120\n      120\n      120\n    \n    \n      BTC added over 10 years\n      1.88 BTC\n      3.77 BTC\n      4.71 BTC\n    \n    \n      DCA contribution at 135k\n      226 049 USD\n      452 400 USD\n      565 122 USD\n    \n    \n      Total Final Net Worth\n      901 049 USD\n      1 127 400 USD\n      1 240 122 USD\n    \n  \n\n\nFormula: 0.0323*x*x-18.607*x+8477.3 (x=count of days) Crash every 30th month to 45k\n\n\n\nBest Exchanges to DCA into Crypto\n\nThe point of DCA strategy is to stick to your long-term bias, come what may. Unless you are extremely disciplined, it will be best done automated.\n\nThe most cost-effective way is to automate your DCA right on the exchange, leaving out any third parties. Other than that you just need an exchange with stable banking setup and well worked-out KYC/AML onboarding, because you are DCA-ing from fiat into crypto.\n\nAs of now, Kraken, FTX and Independent Reserve fulfil these conditions. (Technically, Coinbase does too, but their fees are shocking.)\n\n\n  FTX comes out as the best exchange for DCA in crypto. Their fees are the lowest, there are no legal or regulatory threats and you can automate your DCA right on the platform.\n\n\nAuto-DCA Bots and Templates\n\nExchanges with built-in DCA bots:\n\n\n  FTX - Best overall, but kinda high tech\n  Independent Reserve - Only available for AUD\n  Pionex - New platform, plus you’ll need to use stablecoins\n\n\nStandalone DCA bots:\n\n\n  Coinrule - popular DCA and technical trading bot for most exchanges\n  Bitsgap - DCA bot for Kucoin\n\n\n\n\nFTX Quant Zone Auto-DCA Template\n\nFTX is a crypto exchange that, like Binance, wants US traders to use a separate platform. The US platform does not provide the auto-DCA tool, you will have to use Coinrule to DCA on FTX.us. With FTX’s fees, the combo of FTX and Coinrule is still the best choice for US-based traders.\n\nThe international branch of the exchange lets you automate your trading with an tool called FTX Quant Zone, which to be fair is not built for beginners. If you are not keen on writing your DCA rules in pseudo code, skip further down to third party DCA bots.\n\nFor the rest of you, a weekly auto-DCA template for FTX below.\n\nSign up at FTX.com with 5% fee off\n\n\n\nHow to set up WEEKLY automated DCA with FTX:\n\n\n  \n    Navigate to FTX Quant Zone\n\n    At FTX.com, click the four squares in top left.\n\n    From the menu there, click at FTX Quant Zone.\n  \n  \n    Click: Create New Rule\n\n    This will take you to the Quant Zone interface with two boxes: The trigger and the action.\n  \n  \n    Set up your DCA trigger\n\n    This is the trigger rule to buy a cryptocurrency from USD balance every Sunday (day 6):\n\n    (balance(\"USD\") &gt; 20) and (day_of_week() == 6)\n\n    The first part of the rule checks if you have enough balance to pass the minimum order size. The second part makes sure you will buy every Sunday.\n\n    \n  \n  \n    Set up your DCA action\n\n    In the action box, select “Place Custom Order”, and “Market Order”.\n\n    Also choose the spot market of the crypto you want to DCA in: BTC/USD, ETH/USD…\n\n    \n  \n  \n    Set your DCA order size\n\n    Set your order size as a portion of your wallet balance rather than as a number.\n\n    Example: balance(\"USD\")*0.75. This will market buy your crypto for 3/4 of your USD balance.\n  \n  \n    Click ‘Save and Run’\n\n    Here’s the full template once again.\n\n    \n  \n\n\nSign up at FTX.com with 5% fee off\n\n\n\nAuto-DCA from AUD to crypto on Independent Reserve\n\nIndependent Reserve is an Australian crypto exchange operating since 2013. They accept traders from most parts of the world. It’s a smaller place with responsive support. Onboarding is individual and OTC available.\n\nThe disadvantage of DCAing at Independent Reserve are high fees and limited amount of markets (full list here).\n\nThe auto-DCA feature is only available for AUD. Independent Reserve lets you set up auto-DCA or a basket purchase from AUD via it’s tool called Auto Trader.\n\nSign up at Independent Reserve\n\nHow to set up automated DCA from AUD with Independent Reserve:\n\n\n  \n    Navigate to ‘Accounts’ &gt; ‘Auto Trader’\n\n    The Auto Trader is accessible from the top nav. You need to be logged in.\n  \n  \n    Click the button ‘Create New Strategy’\n\n    The dialog gives you three options, all of them can be used to DCA.\n\n    Most traders will need the 3rd choice - AutoSchedule. This will buy a single cryptocurrency in regular interval with AUD balance, as long as there is any.\n\n    If you want to DCA into a basket of cryptos, go for the 2nd option (AutoBasket). It will split your fiat among several coins, otherwise it’s the same.\n\n    \n  \n  \n    Choose a side\n\n    For DCA you are going to choose the buy side, but the bot can also be set up to sell your crypto.\n  \n  \n    Choose a cryptocurrency to DCA into\n\n    Independent Reserve supports all dinosaur cryptocurrencies and some DeFi tokens. And, indeed, weighted baskets.\n  \n  \n    Choose the frequency of your transactions\n\n    Daily, weekly, fortnightly, monthly, or last day of each month.\n  \n  \n    Select your transaction size\n\n    Either a fixed fiat value, or percentage of your account balance each time the strategy executes.\n  \n\n\nSign up at Independent Reserve\n\n\n\nPionex auto-DCA bot\n\nPionex is a new Asian exchange that has more than 15 different crypto trading bots available right on the exchange. One of them is the DCA bot that will automate the whole process for you.\n\nThe image below shows what the DCA setup looks like - you just need to deposit and click a button.\n\n\n\nThe drawbacks of DCAing via Pionex is that the exchange is fairly new, and that you will need to use the Tether stablecoin to DCA via Pionex.\n\nDisregarding any systemic uncertainties with regards to stablecoins - To buy USDT for fiat you will need to get KYC verified on exchanges like FTX or Bitfinex anyway. Moving money between exchanges creates an additional step that you might find inconvenient.\n\nSign up at Pionex\n\n\n\nCoinrule Auto-DCA Template\n\nCoinrule is a no-coding bot platform that integrates with most popular exchanges. The user interface is fairly easy to understand, it’s all buttons and checkboxes.\n\nCoinrule supports all major exchanges and you can use it to auto-DCA on Kraken, Binance, Coinbase or FTX.us. You probably need to use Coinrule if you are based in the USA.\n\nThe disadvantage of Coinrule is that it’s a paid platform, and that it is a middleman.\n\nHere’s what the Coinrule DCA template looks like, with additional technical analysis conditions:\n\n\n\nCoinrule encourages to add conditions based off technical analysis to your DCA template. For instance, you can set your Coinrule DCA template to only execute if RSI is low.\n\nIt sounds like a good idea as it can weed out your “bad” DCA purchases during tops. On the other hand, over a long stretch of time you may end up gaining less exposure if you set these conditions. This is not very consistent with the idea of DCA.\n\nCoinrule gives a free trial\n\n\n\nBitsgap DCA bot\n\nBitsgap is a new bot trading platform based in Estonia.\n\nMuch like Coinrule, they offer an easy-to-use app, support additional parameters from technical analysis and work with most of the popular crypto trading platforms. Bitsgap lets you DCA on Coinbase, Kraken, Binance, Bitfinex, OKX and other exchanges.\n\n\n\nAs of May 2022, modified DCA bot strategies with MACD and Stoch RSI are in the making, but a grid-like bot is already live.\n\nAgain, introducing technical analysis into DCA sounds like a good idea but over time, you may end up gaining less exposure if you set TA conditions. This is not usually the goal in DCA.\n\nBitsgap gives a free trial\n\n\n\nChecklist: How to set up DCA into crypto\n\nThis is a step by step list of tasks to do to set up DCA or auto-DCA on any exchange. Detailed automation setups by platforms are below.\n\n\n  Do your KYC/AML on your exchange.\n  Set up a monthly transaction from your bank to the exchange (such as on the day after you get paid).\n  Automate your DCA buys - directly on your exchange or via a middleman.\n    \n      Independent Reserve has a feature called Auto Trader. Set it up to buy a cryptocurrency for a set percentage of your AUD balance once a time period.\n      FTX has an interface called Quant Zone that lets you program trades based on any criteria.\n      Coinrule is a bot platform that lets you set up auto-DCA on big exchanges like Kraken or Binance.\n    \n  \n  As long as you have fiat balance at the exchange, your auto-DCA trigger will be executed as set up.\n  On days when there is no deposit in your exchange wallet, auto-DCA will not execute.\n\n\nBenefits of DCA for crypto traders\n\n\n  In ranging or slumping markets with low volumes, the predictive powers of technical analysis decrease as well. The stop hunts and wicks become more prominent, the conditions are simply not good to trade on TA.\n  You avoid babysitting the charts for very small (if any) profits and getting burned out before the macro trend shifts to a more profit-generating action.\n  If you are long term bullish in a bear market, with DCA you have the lowest risk of battered bull syndrome.\n  It’s impossible to overtrade when doing DCA.\n  You can use DCA as the buy or sell method of choice to diversify your crypto portfolio or to implement risk budgeting\n\n\nRelated lists of tools, guides and strategies\n\n\n\n  [101] How to do portfolio diversification in crypto (fundamentals, valuation)\n\n  Market psychology of reversals\n\n  Best wallets for staking (&amp; apps, exchanges, platforms)\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n",

      title: "LocalCryptos or Binance P2P: Detailed Arbitrage Trading Strategy Guide",
      content: "What is P2P arbitrage?\n\nP2P arbitrage is a trading strategy that is quite specific to cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn P2P (peer-to-peer) arbitrage, traders generate profit on the fact that there are P2P marketplaces to buy and sell cryptocurrency privately, with no intermediary and often without getting personally identified.\n\nFor the convenience of skipping the onboarding into a crypto exchange, the P2P seller is allowed to charge a markup over the public market value.\n\nIn this strategy article we will go into the nitty gritty of the P2P arbitrage strategy, including a lot of practical info.\n\nLet’s start with the basics of P2P arbitrage and then go through some public data to see how much a real vendor makes per year.\n\nContents:\n\n  P2P Arbitrage 101\n  How much it earns and what kind of money you need to start\n  Your risks and how to lower them\n  What currencies trade P2P and can be arbed\n\n\nThe basic setup for P2P arbitrage:\n\nP2P arbitrage trader buys a cryptocurrency on a low fee CEX exchange and sells it with a markup on a P2P marketplace.\n\nP2P marketplaces track price action of cryptocurrencies they support, so your markup is given as a percentage over the live rate - such as “5% over Kraken”.\n\nIn P2P arbitrage strategy, the seller re-buys all crypto sold P2P immediately on a low fee CEX exchange for the current market rate.\n\nThe markup charged over the exchange rate minus all your fees makes the arbitrage profit.\n\nPulling off the above setup practically requires you to keep money on all of the platforms involved: The low fee CEX exchange, the P2P market, your bank.\n\n\n  Some of your crypto must be always deposited in your P2P account, otherwise people will not be able to initiate a buy from you.\n  Your CEX exchange account must always have about your expected daily traded volume in fiat, so that you can immediately buy back any crypto that gets sold via your P2P account.\n\n\nOnce someone initiates a buy from you on the P2P platform, you give them your payment details and ask for a confirmation of payment. As soon as they send it, you buy the same amount on your CEX.\n\nOnce the buyer’s payment clears and arrives into your account, you release the crypto to the buyer. Then you transfer the re-bought cryptocurrency from your CEX to your P2P account and you deposit the fiat into your CEX.\n\nWhat kind of profits you can expect from P2P arb\n\nHow much you can earn from P2P arbitrage in crypto? Let’s look at a real vendor.\n\n\n\nThis is an active vendor on LocalCryptos, one of the P2P markets for big cryptos.\n\nThis vendor trades in Hong Kong, Australia and New Zealand and has been active for about a year. He offers ETH with the markup of 2.6% above market price or BTC at 3%. The method of payment is national bank transfer - the least risky one.\n\nThe 3% markup is reasonable for the payment method, it would be much higher for apps like Paypal.\n\nThe total traded volume he made in his one year long activity is 3.75 MM USD. If he traded 5 days a week, this puts his daily traded volume at slightly below 16k USD.\n\nHe is a fairly active trader who makes between 3-4 trades a day on average.\n\nWhen you look at the numbers it’s clear he might have started with only some 50k USD worth of capital that he moves around quickly.\n\nHow much did he manage to make on his 3% markup?\n\n\n  \n    Low fee CEX options\n\n    The first thing to consider in P2P arbitrage is your cost to buy crypto. As a P2P vendor, you are looking to buy from an exchange that has low market order fees (that is the fee for an instant buy) and that supports deposits in your fiat currency.\n\n    This trader sells for HKD, so let’s assume that he is a citizen of Hong Kong and banks there.\n\n    Out of Hong Kong, the vendor is allowed to buy crypto for HKD from Binance.com, FTX.com or OKX. I assume the vendor was starting with fresh exchange accounts without discounts for traded volume but with a discount for referral code, if it’s available.\n\n    Here’s the comparison.\n\n    \n      \n        \n          Exchange\n          Initial market order fee\n          Referral discount\n          Fee\n          Deposit type\n          Bank costs to deposit\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Binance.com\n          0.10%\n          10%\n          0.0900%\n          Instant card payment or local deposit in HKD\n          0\n        \n        \n          FTX.com\n          0.07%\n          5%\n          0.0665%\n          International wire\n          50 HKD (6.4 USD)\n        \n        \n          OKX\n          0.10%\n          0%\n          0.1000%\n          Instant card payment or local deposit in HKD\n          0\n        \n      \n    \n\n    FTX has the lowest trading fees but to wire HKD there you need to do an international wire transfer, which has a cost.\n\n    Binance supports HKD deposits via local bank transfer or instant credit card deposit, which means you wouldn’t have to keep your money on the exchange.\n\n    Binance also lets you gain further fee rebates for holding BNB fairly easily and often releases flat fee discounts for everyone. On the other hand, crypto trades at a slightly higher rates on Binance when compared to FTX.\n\n    Overall I’d say it’s still more convenient to choose the exchange with a fast local deposit, which is Binance in this case.\n  \n  \n    Costs of for your P2P sales\n\n    This vendor trades on LocalCryptos which is a decentralized application with a built-in escrow. The app is built in a zero-knowledge way which means that it has managed to resist any rulings about platform-wide KYC, but private KYC from the side of the vendor is encouraged.\n\n    Buyers don’t mind complying with that. The LocalCryptos platform has no access even to the files exchanged in private communication between the buyer and vendor.\n\n    The platform is also non-custodial. You need to deposit your crypto into an exchange wallet so that it can participate in the escrow on the platform, but you get your 12 word seed phrase for your P2P wallet.\n\n    The ultra secure setup of LocalCryptos lowers the risks of the vendor getting scammed (without any top down regulation, by the way). That allows vendors to charge lower markups; this vendor does charge a relatively low markup of 3%.\n\n    He will probably ask for a picture of your ID and will refuse to trade if the name on the transfer won’t match that of your ID. He can afford that because the APAC region is one of the most popular ones on LocalCryptos.\n\n    LocalCryptos charge escrow fees of 0.25% if you post an offer, so this together with the transaction fee for the release adds to the vendors expense.\n  \n  \n    Putting it all together\n\n    Assuming the trader chose Binance with a basic 10% discount and pays nothing for his bank account, which is possible with some of the new digital-only banks in Hong Kong, he earned about 96k USD in his year of activity. He made ~2.6% - not of his initial investment, but of his traded volume.\n\n    Considering he might have started with about 50k USD, he effectively dOuBlEd hIs BiTcOiN without risking any money on speculation or without locking it into sketchy interest yielding schemes.\n\n    \n      \n        \n           \n          Yearly\n          Monthly\n          Daily *\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Traded volume\n          $ 3,750,000\n          $ 312,500\n          $ 15,625\n        \n        \n          Markup earned (3%)\n          $ 112,500\n          $ 9,375\n          $ 469\n        \n        \n           \n           \n           \n           \n        \n        \n          EXPENSES:\n           \n           \n           \n        \n        \n          Binance fees (0.09%)\n          $                3,375\n          $             281\n          $          14\n        \n        \n          Escrow fees (0.25%)\n          $                9,375\n          $             781\n          $          39\n        \n        \n          Bank fees (0%)\n          $                     -\n          $                -\n          $           -\n        \n        \n          BTC tx fees (avg 2 USD) **\n          $                   2,500\n          $               208\n          $            10\n        \n        \n           \n           \n           \n           \n        \n        \n          PROFIT:\n          $ 96,875\n          $ 8,104\n          $ 405\n        \n        \n           \n           \n           \n           \n        \n        \n          * Assuming 20 working days per month\n           \n           \n           \n        \n        \n          ** Assuming 5 transactions per day, 5 days a week, 50 weeks per year\n           \n           \n           \n        \n      \n    \n\n    I ran the same with numbers for OKX and FTX, both exchanges gave a slightly lower profit, about 1k USD less yearly.\n\n    If you have more capital, you could possibly optimise your process by parking some of your money into stablecoins. Both USDC and USDT are accepted for fast deposit on FTX.com, along with several other stablecoins.\n\n    You could buy your stablecoin for fiat deposited locally for zero banking free and then make use of the lower fees on FTX.com by re-buying on their Tether markets.\n\n    Stablecoins do introduce some additional risk though, and the extra profit made from it would be only about 1k USD yearly over the Binance setup.\n\n    Obligatory shill links:\n    \n      FTX 5% fee off - use code altcointrading on FTX.com or altcointradingUS on FTX.us\n      Binance.com 10% fee off with shill link\n      LocalCryptos sign up or read our review\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe risks of P2P arbitrage (and how to limit them)\n\nYour risks in this strategy are not trading risks.\n\nP2P arbitrage is true arbitrage: You are buying and selling the same asset at the same time, which means that you are not exposed to losses from price volatility.\n\nAll your risks in P2P arbitrage are counter-party risks:\n\n\n  Your P2P buyer can scam you. For instance, they can pay you via PayPal and ask for a refund when you release the crypto.\n  Your CEX can fold or get hacked.\n  Not all P2P marketplaces are non-custodial. If you trade on a custodial P2P market where you don’t have the private keys of your P2P wallet, then the funds on that P2P can be lost just like on a CEX.\n\n\nTo lower your risks, the most important thing is to use an escrow. Escrow will lock the crypto out of your or the buyer’s reach until you release it after you make sure that the fiat payment arrived.\n\nEscrow is available on all big P2P markets - LocalMonero, LocalBitcoins, LocalCryptos, Binance P2P.\n\nYou generally won’t get escrow in private deals over Telegram or message boards. Just in case you need to hear it from someone, people absolutely can scam you even if they’ve been trading with you for months prior, it happens all the time.\n\nGetting scammed by your buyer is by far the largest risk you face. Other than that it’s just security breach on your exchange or on your account. You can lower your CEX risks by not holding money on there and choosing a CEX with instant deposit option for your currency. Or you can use stablecoins, if you are feeling brave.\n\nList of cryptocurrencies you can trade P2P\n\nThe largest crypto P2P marketplaces are the following:\n\n  LocalCryptos trades Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dash, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash\n  Paxful trades Bitcoin, Tether and Ethereum and requires AML/KYC for some regions\n  LocalMonero trades Monero\n\n\nTwo more large P2P marketplaces are the following, who require a centralized platform-wide KYC:\n\n  Binance P2P requires KYC and trades Bitcoin, Tether, BUSD, Binance Coin, Doge and DAI\n  LocalBitcoins requires KYC and trades Bitcoin\n\n\nFinal notes\n\nIn P2P arbitrage, you earn money on a small markup that you circle around as fast as ever you can.\n\nThe way to earn in this trading strategy is not necessarily by having a ton of capital (even though that helps) but moving it around quickly. You will not be able to pull that off in many locations around the world because the demand just isn’t there. I suggest you browse P2P marketplaces yourself and see if you are in a good geolocation to sell P2P.\n\nA lot of the practical side depends on where you are, but if you want to do volumes in P2P, you will probably have to set up a company for that. In general you should not need a license for this type of activity unless you do it as an asset management service with other people’s money, but YMMV.\n\nLastly, the latest rounds of EU regulations makes it look like there might be regulations imposed on P2P vendors. The law is only set to come to effect in 2024, so there’s still plenty time to make money. But under it, P2P vendors would probably be required to store the buyers’ ID.\n\nThat’s the five dollar wrench attack equivalent as applicable to zero-knowledge dApps: Even if the platform is zero-knowledge, the vendor can always screenshot what buyers send to them.\n\n\n",

      title: "TensorCharts - Crypto charting app with Orderbook Heatmap, Counter's Ratio and more",
      content: "What are Tensorcharts?\n\nThe idea of TensorCharts is similar to the one behind Footprint Charts^(R).\n\nThe charts that will let you “see inside the bars” as their slogan says, and unlike many marketing catchphrases, this one actually fits.\n\n\n  Learn about Footprint Trading in the ATNET Glossary\n\n\nIt’s an advanced charting tool particularly good for daytraders and scalpers on the legacy markets. You can request a free demo of the Footprint Charts app here.\n\nFootprint candles\n\nDifference between Tensorcharts vs Footprintcharts\n\nWith footprint chart you see the regular candlestick chart candle split into steps on the price axis (such as into steps by 100 USD). This way you get to see the exact amount of money traded on which price level.\n\nEach footprint chart block is colored and has a number inside - the number of dollars that was traded in that block.\n\nTensor Charts, a web app developed originally for crypto, draw from a similar idea. With Tensor Chart you get different granularity of information, depending on much you zoom in.\n\nThat is actually a feature: It prevents the analysis paralysis.\n\nThe price blocks at Tensor Charts are always colored at a scale based on the volume traded there, zoom in and you’ll get the traded money as well.\n\nBasically, it is similar to a far more precise volume flow script.\n\nThat’s not all though. In addition to the traded footprint, TensorCharts also provide a whole host of other advanced crypto trading tools.\n\nOrderbook heatmap\n\nWhat is Orderbook Heatmap\n\nHere’s what I mean: Even in the basic free tier, TensorCharts provide the famous orderbook heatmap.\n\nWhat’s the orderbook visualization good for? Let me explain:\n\n\n  The price action, and therefore the market, is made by executed orders.\n  Executed orders are displayed as green and red blocks for filled buys and sells. On a standard chart theese would be green and red candlesticks.\n  The buy support and sell resistance is practically enforced by limit orders waiting on either side of the market. These are shown in shades of blue and yellow, distinguished by their size.\n\n\n\n\nYou can customize your orderbook heatmap through settings and decide how granular the data should be.\n\n\n  To learn ow to use Tensor Charts head over to our TensorCharts Tutorials.\n\n\nSee the spoofers thanks to orderbook heatmap\n\nThe orderbook heatmap function makes it easy to discover buy and sell walls. You will also just as easily see if the walls get pulled or if they execute. If you have been crypto trading for a bit, you know that spoofers like to paint support and resistance only to cancel their orders just before they would get filled.\n\nTo see a spoofer on a candlestick chart you really need to stop staring at the chart, open up the full orderbook and meditate for a while.\n\nThen, once the orders get pulled, there is no information left about them in the books.\n\nContrary to that, Tensor Charts record this event as the past orders remain recorded in the heatmap after the candle close.\n\nIntermittent support and resistance for your 5-min trading strategies\n\nEven when there are no spoofers though, the Tensor Charts’ heatmap also provides an idea about intermittent support and resistance levels.\n\nYou can clearly see the areas with most money in open orders at a single glance.\n\nHere for instance significant buys on BCH markets:\n\n\n\nDifferences in strength between several altcoins\n\nLast but not least, the differences between various cryptocurrency markets also become apparent fairly quickly.\n\nThis 5M tensor chart of the ETHUSD market shows a lot of small orders, some of them coinciding into a resistance level:\n\n\n\nOn this BTCUSD 5M chart you see the differences in order sizes are more marked, there are a few key levels with huge orders but the rest of the orders filling the space in between is of quite insignificant size in comparison:\n\n\n\nThere’s lot more that you can do with TensorCharts, I encourage you to explore their documentation.\n\nTensorCharts FREE Plan\n\nTensorCharts are available free with basic functions pulling data from the most popular exchange APIs: Bitfinex, Binance, GDAX, BitStamp, BitMEX. In the free plan you get 5M and 1H timeframes, orderbook heatmap and trades counter.\n\nIt is not necessary to create a user account.\n\nIf you like working with orderbook heatmaps and only basic indicators like bbands or fibs, Tensorcharts are far better than the currently most popular free charting app Cryptowatch.\n\nTensorCharts PRO Plans\n\nPaid plans went live on September 18th 2018, one year to day since the development of the TensorCharts app started.\n\nPlans range from 8 USD - 25 USD per month, paid only in crypto.\n\n\n  To learn ow to use Tensor Charts head over to our section for TensorCharts Tutorials.\n\n\nTensorcharts Free Alternative\n\nIf you are not sure you are willing to pay for this stuff, you can piece together a poor man’s tensorcharts alternative on TradingView.\n\nIt is not even close to the same product, but if you just don’t want to pay, it is something.\n\n\n  Make a chart at TradingView FREE\n  Go to Indicators and script and search for “Poor man’s volume profile”, a free VPVR alternative. Apply it.\n  Next look up “[ST] Volume Flow v6” by spacetrader, which colors your candles based on changes in volume. It colours full candles as a whole, the data is less granular than footprint candles. But it’s free.\n\n\nSummary: Powerful Tool\n\nTensorCharts have come a long way since we first published a post about them in January 2018.\n\nAs the development advanced, programmable indicators were added along with experimental indicators such as the Counters Ratio.\n\nTensorCharts are now beating both Cryptowatch and TradingView in terms of the amount of information (and therefore edge) you can extract from them.\n\nWe were probably the first blog to call for paid plans, this kind of tool should not be available for free.\n\nWe’re happy the paid plans are here, it could help with the only issue Tensor Charts traders keep complaining about: That during abrupt price action you can only hope the server won’t get too overloaded. I’d argue it’s still not as bad as when you get this on BitMEX though.\n\nStill, even the free version of Tensor Charts can give you quite a good edge if you use it right.\n\nThe TensorCharts app\n\n\n  Tensorcharts on Twitter: @tensorcharts\n  Tensorcharts on Youtube\n  Post about Tensorcharts on ProductHunt\n\n\nFull TensorCharts Pricing information\n\n\n  \n    \n       \n      FREE\n      PREMIUM\n      TEAM\n      ALGO TRADER\n    \n  \n  \n    \n       \n      $0\n      $18\n      5x$8                                   total $40\n      $25\n    \n    \n       \n      For newcomers exploring orderflow, heatmaps and volumetric analysis\n      For experienced daytraders who don’t want to compromise on anything.

BitMEX platform is no longer recommended since mid-2020.\n\n  \n    For futures trading, use Bitfinex (no KYC, 6% fee discount)\n  \n  \n    For perps and crypto options, use Deribit (easy KYC, 10% fee discount)\n  \n\n\nWhy is Bitmex no longer a good place to trade\n\nUp until August 2020, BitMEX was your trusty exchange where no KYC was necessary and you could access the exchange even from Tor or VPN - it breached the TOS but compliance was not enforced, as was the custom.\n\nIn August 2020, BitMEX announced they will be requiring KYC from all users starting 28 August 2020.The KYC procedure includes government documents, selfie and a questionnaire. As a reminder BitMEX does not serve US traders.\n\n\n  2021 BitMEX no-KYC alternative is Phemex exchange.

If that makes you uncomfortable, try working on your trading psychology.\n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n \n\nMore About BitMEX\n\nBitMEX is a cryptocurrency derivative platform. You cannot buy altcoins or bitcoin on BitMEX with your national currency, you can only trade their products for profit. You get your winnings paid out in BTC.\n\nCurrently the most traded products are BTC futures, ETH futures and BTC perpetual swap (derivative mimicking spot BTCUSD market).\n\nIn addition to that, BitMEX sometimes opens betting on upcoming events in the crypto markets - the betting market for the COIN ETF was up in February 2017.\n\n\n  Leverage is dynamic between 1x and 100x. Trade with caution, overleveraged traders cause margin cascades on BitMEX.\n  Fees are changeable - depending on the market and on some also whether you’re long or short. (see our short explainer of Perps)\n  Derivatives have a mark price based on Coinbase, Bitstamp and Kraken spot.\n  The dynamic way of perpetual swap funding makes it possible to trade non-speculative positions that will only earn from funding payouts, but vast majority of BitMEX traders come for short term speculation.\n\n\n\n\nBitMEX and US Customers\n\nBitMEX does not serve US customers. However, the exchange is accessible from a VPN or from the Tor network.\n\nIf you are US-based trader looking for high leverage, you have the following options:\n\n  Move on to non-custodial leveraged trading\n  Use a VPN to trade on platforms that still don’t require KYC.\n\n\nTraders based in United States are restricted to trade on Bitfinex, but KYC is not yet required on that platforms.\n\nDeribit started requiring KYC on 9 November 2020.\n\nGet 10% fee discount on BitMEX\n",

Also requires utility bill for address proof, no older than 90 days.\n\nIntermediate level verification gives you a more seamless crypto experience on Bitfinex. It does not entitle you to deposit and withdraw fiat, but it does entitle you to deposit and withdraw Tether.\n\n\n  Access to airdrops and giveaways\n\n\nGetting verified to at least intermediate level opens up the possibility for you to participate in airdrops that Bitfinex runs to promote new token launches on the platform.\n\n\n  Faster cryptocurrency deposits\n\n\nVerified users can trade deposited cryptocurrency faster, fewer confirmations are required before their deposit is credited.\n\n\n  Access to exchange token\n\n\nBitfinex has their own exchange token (LEO) that can generate fee discount on other tokens for you.\n\nFull Level Verification on Bitfinex\n\nRequires bank statement, but only your first deposit must come from that account.\n\nFull verification on Bitfinex entitles you to all benefits of the intermediate level, plus fiat deposits and withdrawals.\n\nThis is the only way in which Bitfinex still has minimum deposit requirement - you can only move fiat that is worth at least 10k USD.\n\nBitfinex Referral Code   TradingView PRO Referral Code\n\nTools for your Bitfinex trading\n\nUse the Bitfinex app to trade from your phone, but restrict its capabilities so that your trading stash stays safe even on the phone you are using day to day.\n\n\n  \n    #HOWTO How to use the Bitfinex App in a secure way\n  \n  \n    #GUIDES Crypto Wallet Guide: Where to store crypto in 2020\n  \n  \n    #TRADING 3 Most Dangerous Beginner Mistakes in Crypto Trading\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n  \n    Want to *really* learn crypto charting &amp; technical analysis?\n    Hate to break it to you, but there's no trading school, no neatly structured course and no simple how to. \n      Read our articles to get familiar with the tools, but try everything hands on.

It has a full featured interface with all you need for daytrading spot or futures market in crypto, and the same data-rich UI for the lending market.\n\nOn the other hand, Bitfinex doesn’t provide as high leverage as BitMEX and is not focused primarily on derivatives, which means the crowd on Bitfinex is less focused on very short-term speculation. Margin cascades are rare.\n\nThe user interface on Bitfinex has embedded charts from TradingView PRO.

Identity verification is not needed for lending.\n  Bitfinex opened a derivatives section of the platform in September 2019.\n\n\nThe Bitfinex exchange is available worldwide. There is limitation on margin trade for Americans - however the exchange is still operational from American IP address. New users on US IP just have to state they are not American residents.\n\nNo KYC is needed other than for fiat deposit/withdrawal.

      title: "Independent Reserve Review (Referral Code RCZSEV)",
      content: "\n  Independent Reserve: Value is where the crowd isn’t\n\n\nIndependent Reserve Referral Code: RCZSEV\n\nIndependent Reserve is an Australian crypto exchange that stayed fairly low-profile in the industry ever since the platform was founded in 2013.\n\nIt is not even a popular crypto platform on Reddit, probably because its old trading interface absolutely could not compare to places like Bitfinex:\n\n\n\nAs of October 2020, Independent Reserve finally caved and announced they are building a professional charting engine with Tradingview charts. This will get on par with Bitfinex.\n\nSo far they have only launched the Android and iPhone app.\n\n\n\nLuckily, in this particular comparison with Bitfinex, they are not trying to imitate the state of Bitfinex’s banking too.\n\n\n  Independent Reserve is open to Australian as well as international users\n  There is no policy specific to US traders. Traders are KYC’s individually, on a case by case basis, and USD deposits are available.\n  The multiple bank connections at Independent Reserve (AUD, NZD, SGP, USD) have been stable since the founding of the exchange in 2013\n  OTC desk for higher volumes is readily available upon verification\n  As a regulated financial business, Independent Reserve offers financial advisory upon request\n  Asset insurance available for a yearly fee\n  Support desk is well staffed and super responsive even to basic account holders\n\n\nThe drawback here are the trading fees which are higher than the standard, but as long as you are not day trading there, it is not a serious drawback.\n\nTrading fees at Independent Reserve do get lower with higher traded volume.\n\nTrading at Independent Reserve Review\n\nThis Australian crypto exchange is not the best place for day traders. They are reliable in the legal sense of the word, but they have neither the trading interface nor the server capacity to support daytrading FOMO waves.\n\nThere is no leveraged trading or derivatives either, and you get strictly fiat-crypto pairs only. This is an exchange for entering the crypto market and exiting it.\n\nOn days where bitcoin, as the highest volume crypto asset on Independent Reserve, makes an abrupt price swing, you can bet the website will be down at least for a bit during the day.\n\nIndependent Reserve does have a REST API. You will get better availability there, but sadly the API is not listed in multi-exchange and arbitrage tools like Coinigy.\n\nAnother advantage is that Independent Reserve is based in Australia, and although they accept users from all around the world, most of their user base is from Australia, New Zealand and Southeast Asia. What that means is their high traffic periods may happen during your night, if you are in North America.\n\nTo put it simply, their availability in high traffic is as bad as Kraken’s, but the high load happens at different times of the day.\n\nIndependent Reserve Referral Code: RCZSEV\n\nIndependent Reserve is best for DCA and long-term traders\n\nYou will be happy at Independent Reserve if you are looking for a reliable place to DCA. This is the place where you can automate your DCA in as well as out at no additional cost.\n\nIndependent Reserve is a great platform for any kind of long-term investing and long-term holding. The exchange offers a premium subscription plan that insures your assets held at the exchange and may even provide tax services or financial advice.\n\nBut even for a basic account, making the purchase of cryptoassets easy is one of the things that Independent Reserve really excels at. And not just for Bitcoin.\n\nIndependent Reserve Supported Currencies\n\nIndependent Reserve lets you trade BTC, ETH, USDt, Polkadot, XRP, LTC, EOS, LINK, MKR, DAI, and many DeFi tokens. The carefully vetted selection of DeFi trading markets was first added in September 2020.\n\n\n  Note: If you’re looking for dog money, they have the DOGE, but no other dog money. You’ll find your dog money on Bitforex.\n\n\nAll cryptocurrencies are available in pairs with fiat currencies only (Independent Reserve is an exchange for buying): AUD, NZD, SGP, USD. Deposits for the respective fiat currencies are available internationally at no fee for over 5000 USD worth.\n\nTIP: Independent Reserve runs a regular trading fee promo for the first two weeks of trading whenever they add a new pair. Subscribe to our Airdrops and Deals email where we alert you on these promo offers.\n\nHere’s link to the current list of open markets at Independent Reserve, the screenshot below is from May 2021.\n\n\n\nIndependent Reserve Trading Fees\n\nIndependent Reserve is not the best fit for short term traders. There is no difference between maker and taker fees.\n\nFee discounts at Independent Reserve come with monthly traded volume. The volume counts as rolling for the past 30 days and updates every 4 hours.\n\nFee levels by volume:\n\n\n  \n    \n      30 day trade volume AUD\n      Trading fee\n      30 day trade volume AUD\n      Trading fee\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      0.5 %\n      2,000,000\n      0.16 %\n    \n    \n      100,000\n      0.48 %\n      2,500,000\n      0.14 %\n    \n    \n      minus 0.02% every 50k AUD\n       \n      3,000,000\n      0.12 %\n    \n    \n      500,000\n      0.32 %\n      4,000,000\n      0.1 %\n    \n    \n      minus 0.02% every 100k AUD\n       \n      6,000,000\n      0.08 %\n    \n    \n      1,000,000\n      0.22 %\n      10,000,000\n      0.05 %\n    \n    \n      1,200,000\n      0.2 %\n      20,000,000\n      0.02 %\n    \n    \n      1,600,000\n      0.18 %\n       \n       \n    \n  \n\n\nIndependent Reserve Referral Code: RCZSEV\n\nStaking on Independent Reserve\n\nStaking through Independent Reserve is not possible.\n\nThe exchange provides and easy way to purchase PoS coins from (pretty much) all over the world, but after that you will need to withdraw your cryptocurrency and stake it either from a wallet (Exodus) or from another exchange (FTX, Bitfinex).\n\nMore details in our article about staking wallets and services.\n\nIndependent Reserve Mobile App\n\nIndependent Reserve released the official smartphone app in November 2021. It is available on Google Play and in the Apple App Store.\n\nTake care to check the name of the developer, it should be “Independent Reserve”.\n\nIndependent Reserve Android app:\n\n\n\nIndependent Reserve iPhone or iPad app:\n\n\n\nCrypto Trading Strategies Best for Independent Reserve\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n          \n        \n      \n      \n        Fulcrum bottom\n        Fulcrum bottom has been talked about a lot lately thanks to mentions in Peter Brandt's reports.

Coin control will make it easier to sell\n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n \n\nTop 3 Independent Reserve Products\n\n1/ Automated Dollar-cost averaging on Independent Reserve\n\nIndependent Reserve is one of the few crypto exchanges that provides an automated way to buy or sell cryptocurrencies.\n\nOn Independent Reserve, they call this feature “AutoSchedule” and while it can be used to both buy and sell crypto, it is most attractive as a tool for dollar-cost averaging, or DCA.\n\nAutoSchedule lets you automatically buy or sell a cryptocurrency on a custom schedule using funds already in your account.\n\nYou can either spread one deposit into a gradual DCA over time to avoid speculating on your entry point, or you can combine regular scheduled transactions on Independent Reserve with regular scheduled transfers from your bank to the exchange.\n\nHow to set up automated DCA in 4 steps:\n\n\n  Choose a side: For DCA you are going to choose the buy side, but the bot can also be set up to sell your crypto.\n  Choose a cryptocurrency to DCA into: Independent Reserve supports most major cryptocurrencies and some DeFi tokens.\n  Choose the frequency of your transactions: Daily, weekly, fortnightly, monthly, or last day of each month.\n  Select your transaction size: Either a fixed fiat value, or percentage of your account balance each time the strategy executes.\n\n\n2/ Arbitrage Trading on Independent Reserve\n\nThe relative unpopularity (yet still an active enough market) coupled with OTC availability and good banking connections makes Independent Reserve a good place for high-volume arbitrage trading.\n\n\n  International deposits are free from 5000 USD worth and over. Withdrawals to foreign bank accounts get a flat fee of 20 USD. No third-party withdrawals, you can only withdraw to an account that’s on the name with which you verified on the exchange - this is in compliance with Australian AML laws.\n  Independent Reserve doesn’t have higher free for instant market orders. Both maker and taker trades cost the same.\n  The full spot exchange fee is 0.5% but fee discount start already at 100k AUD 30d traded volume. 10 MM AUD volume generated over 30 days gets you down to 0.05% fee per trade.\n\n\nAdditionally, there is an option to purchase Independent Reserve Premium accounts which are insured, have lower trading fees and get preferential attention from support.\n\nInsured Premium accounts start at 15k AUD yearly - learn more.\n\n3/ Independent Reserve’s “Aussie Crypto Market Update” Newsletter\n\nLast but not least, something that is really worth it and not only because it’s free. This weekly mail from Independent Reserve really attests to the staff’s competence.\n\nIt’s not as fussy and long as BitMEX’s letters; and it’s not focused on hype or speculative borderline FUD either.\n\nIf you’re notoriously busy, or just don’t like wasting time, these emails will give you a good summary of what’s been happening on the crypto markets.\n\n\n\nGo sign up and then you’ll see the newsletter opt-in option at news/subscribe.\n\nIndependent Reserve Exchange as Company\n\nIt is very likely that Independent Reserve will remain a stable gateway between fiat and crypto via traditional banking and SWIFT transfers.\n\nThey are something of an outlier among crypto trading platforms. The platform is organized as a local Australian company, not as an offshore business which is more common in crypto.\n\nIndependent Reserve Pty. Ltd.\nLevel 26, 44 Market Street\nSydney, 2000\nNew South Wales, Australia\n\nABN 46 164 257 069\n\n\nSummary: Stable arbitrage opportunity, DCA, OTC, Asset Insurance\n\nIf you any of the lines of business we reviewed here are something that you could use, feel free to apply our referral code RCZSEV when signing up at Independent Reserve.\n\nIndependent Reserve Referral Code: RCZSEV\n",

VPN will pass on Phemex, but since trading from the US is a breach of terms of service, Phemex might terminate your account and close your positions at any time.\n\nSign up at Phemex\n\nTrading on Phemex\n\n\n\nPhemex exchange is a crypto trading platform focusing on cryptocurrency derivatives. Phemex has both the spot and contract trading for crypto markets, though.\n\nThe platform makes buying and trading crypto accessible to beginners.\n\nIn that spirit, Phemex also runs their own testnet version for novice traders who want to learn the skill by paper trading. You can access Phemex testnet at testnet.phemex.com.\n\nPhemex also provides a knowledge base of tutorials and how-tos in both text and video versions. Youtube playlist of Phemex tutorials here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo sum it up, Phemex is following the trends rather than innovating, and is making trading user-friendly.\n\nThat means they are attracting the new altcoin trading crowd that is always looking for where it’s at. For instance, recently Phemex added DOGE/USD and AAVE/USD contracts with up to 20x leverage due to popular demand.\n\nPhemex Fees\n\nThe Phemex fee and leverage structure is pretty much modeled after BitMEX: You get up to 100x leverage with 0.075% taker fee and -0.025% for maker. That is, market makers get a fee rebate on Phemex.\n\nThe flagship product of Phemex is likewise one we’d seen on BitMEX first: the BTCUSD perpetual swap.\n\nFiat options on Phemex\n\nUnlike on BitMEX, Phemex lets you settle you leveraged positions in fiat as well - that is also your perps trading can be settled in fiat.\n\nYou can also deposit and withdraw fiat at Phemex.\n\nMobile trading on Phemex\n\nPhemex does provide a native smartphone app. You can find it on the App Store and Play Store as released by PHEMEX TECHNOLOGY PTE. LTD..\n\nPhemex Premium Accounts\n\nPhemex traders can opt into Premium account options.\n\nPremium accounts are a paid feature billed as a subscription, but you can also get your premium account as a reward for social media shilling.\n\nPremium users have higher withdrawal limits and zero fees for spot trading through the web app or smartphone app.\n\nPhemex Bonuses\n\nPhemex has a long-running set of bonuses for deposits and trades over certain USD value.\n\nThere are additional bonuses and competitions that are offered timely to catch traders’ attention. After the Elon Musks tweets about Dogecoin there was a DOGE giveaway for instance.\n\nGet Phemex deposit bonus\n\nIn addition to bonuses, there is the Phemex Savings account. Tether deposits that you lock in your Savings account (you will see the option in your account dashboard) get 10% APY. Phemex claims to get that profit from their own trading activites and also claims to cover any losses.\n\nSo far, Phemex does not offer a staking pool for earnings.\n\nPhemex Company\n\nRisk Note: Phemex is new in the business, does not require KYC and limits withdrawals, therefore proceed with caution.\n\nPhemex is a Singapore-based cryptocurrency business.\n\nPhemex operates as PHEMEX TECHNOLOGY PTE. LTD. for the IT side of their platform and as PHEMEX FINANCIAL PTE. LTD. for their brokerage activities. Both companies are located at the same address and were only incorporated in January 2020.\n\nPhemex Address\n\n100 TRAS STREET\n#16-01\n100 AM\nSINGAPORE (079027)\n\n\nThe initial focus of Phemex was on an easy-to-use cryptocurrency wallet with a built-in way of purchasing bitcoin through the fiat payment channels popular in Southeast Asia, such as Union Pay.\n\nOver time Phemex expanded to build a derivatives trading platform.\n\nPhemex is a custodial platform and is new in the trading industry. They claim their contract trading platform is the fastest one in the crypto trading industry, but given they are not as widely popular as some other trading platforms, that claim is obviously untested.\n\nThe platform that so far stood best the test of time and user load is still Bitfinex, which also recently opened some derivative markets, btw.\n\nFor smaller traders though, the Phemex fees will come lower in comparison.\n\nGet Phemex deposit bonus\n\nPhemex alternatives\n\nIf you worry about the risks associated with Phemex, trade on one of the more established derivative platforms:\n\n\n  FTX (bitcoin and altcoin perps) - has KYC for withdrawals over 1k USD\n  Deribit (large-cap crypto futures, options) - has KYC\n  Phemex (perps, bonuses and competitions) - no KYC\n\n",

      content: "Deribit KYC\n\nDeribit requires KYC for new traders since 9 November 2020.\n\nThe current KYC requirements are a government ID and a bill that proves your residential address.\n\nThe KYC at Deribit is largely automated - the documents get verified near real time. For the bill, online-only document is accepted as well (such as online banking statement)\n\nGet Deribit 10% Discount\n\nDoes Deribit Serve US Customers?\n\n\n  Deribit does not serve US customers.\n  Deribit started requiring KYC on 9 November 2020.\n\n\nThere are several Deribit alternatives for US customers:\n\nPerpetual swap and contract trading is available without KYC with VPN on the Singaporean Phemex exchange.\n\nAnother new crypto derivative exchange, Bitforex, offers contract trading in crypto, commodities and forex without KYC with no policy specified for US traders.\n\nGet Deribit 10% Discount\n\nTrading on Deribit\n\nDeribit is an advanced crypto trading platform for cryptocurrency derivatives.\n\nThe Deribit platform is custodial, but trusted. Representatives can be found in crypto traders’ communities.\n\nThe flagship Deribit product are cryptocurrency options, but Deribit also runs crypto perps (the perpetual swap) and crypto futures markets.\n\nTrading options on Deribit\n\nOptions can be very lucrative, but if you don’t know how to trade them, you can get hammered in a pretty bad way. On the other hand, using options instead of stop-loss can be a very sensible idea, especially if you trade on exchanges like Kraken that are notoriously unrealiable with order execution.\n\n\n  More on speculative and non-speculative Deribit strategies in our blog\n\n\nDeribit is building up an educational section at insights.deribit.com where they go into detail about how options work and how you can use them. For the more complex positions, you get a Google Spreadsheet to understand how your Profit/Loss would change depending on spot price.\n\n\n\n\nGet Deribit 10% Discount\n\nDeribit Crypto Bots\n\nDeribit is a platform that focuses on advanced derivatives traders, high net worth individuals who know how to hedge, and on professional scale market makers.\n\nDue to that, Deribit encourages the use of trading bots and API integrations. They even list several crypto bot platforms among their partners on their website.\n\nCoinrule and Deribit\n\nThe most user-friendly among the crypto bots that are listed as Deribit partners is definitely CoinRule. Coinrule is a no-coding-required crypto bot platform for beginner as well as advanced trading strategies. If you are new to bot trading or if you do not want to run your own server for your bot trading, Coinrule is the right choice.\n\nTIP: Coinrule is FREE for traded volumes below 3K USD per month. It’s good enough to test it, for after that get your 25% off with this link. Depending on seasonal offers, paid plans start at 9.9 USD per month, tiered by the number of active crypto bots you’re running.\n\nDeribit derivatives as a BitMEX alternative\n\nWhy is BitMEX no longer a good place to trade, to such extent that we need Deribit as an alternative?\n\nUp until August 2020, BitMEX was your trusty exchange where no KYC was necessary. You could even trade there from Tor or VPN - it breached the TOS but compliance was not enforced, as was the custom.\n\nIn August 2020, BitMEX announced they will be requiring KYC from all users starting 28 August 2020. Shortly after it transpired they got into serious legal troubles, and a while later that they are possibly using their (massive!) insurance fund to make their profits unavailable to the authorities.\n\nIn plain English, this won’t end well.\n\nThe BitMEX KYC procedure includes government documents, selfie and a questionnaire. As a reminder, BitMEX does not serve US traders, but according to reports everyone who had money on BitMEX was able to withdraw.\n",

However, note that Bitforex is new in the business. Proceed with caution.\n\nBitforex &amp; US Customers\n\nBitforex does not mention United States in their terms of service.\n\nUnited States and several other locations are typically listed as restricted in announcements of airdrops and trading competitions though.\n\nSign up at Bitforex\n\nTrading on Bitforex\n\nBitforex is geared towards daytraders. They do have a deposit bonus and run other reward programs, but overall the platform is less into all the gamification that you see in other Asian trading platforms like Phemex.\n\nThe platforms has a strange fee policy, though: If you want a maker/taker fee split, you need to apply for a VIP account and fulfil any conditions you will be asked to fulfil.\n\nWith a standard account, the Bitforex trading fees are 0.1% on all crypto spot markets or 0.08% if you trade through their MT5 interface.\n\n\n\nBitforex does have interesting products for active altcoin traders though:\n\n\n  Up to 200x leverage (through MT5)\n  Spot and perpetual swap crypto markets\n  Forex, Commodity and Index CFDs (through MT5)\n  EasySwap - a hybrid DEX with zero gas fees\n\n\nThe offer Bitforex has built amounts to a pretty extensive brokerage, similar to what you might be used to from legacy markets.\n\nSign up at Bitforex\n\nWho is behind Bitforex\n\nThat is the question indeed.\n\nOn their social media listings, Bitforex company claims to be headquartered in Hong Kong and registered in the Republic of Seychelles. We know that kind of setup from BitMEX.\n\nThere is no word about any regulatory compliance anywhere. We know that as well.\n\nBitforex claims to run on venture capital obtained from a fund whose website possibly never even existed, or only for a short spell, which looks sketchy.\n\nHowever, in Asian crypto trading platforms this is all quite the common way to do business as long as you are new enough.\n\nBitforex may be worth the risk for small altcoins\n\nBitforex sometimes claims they have been operating since 2017 but no company data can be found and the company name does not appear in press releases older than 2019.\n\nSo, this seems to be your regular new Asian crypto trading platform.\n\nWill be worth the risk if you want to trade a small altcoin that is not listed elsewhere, or if you can take advantage of their bonus offers.\n\nSign up at Bitforex\n\nBitforex also makes it easy to get your token listed\n\nIf you just want to trade the large-cap cryptos, there are better places to do that:\n\n\n  FTX (bitcoin and altcoin perps) - has KYC for withdrawals over 1k USD\n  Deribit (large-cap crypto futures, options) - has KYC\n  Phemex (perps, bonuses and competitions) - no KYC\n\n\nBut Bitforex is really the best place to trade small-cap, very new altcoins. This is thanks to the hybrid DEX that Bitforex runs (EasySwap).\n\nOn EasySwap, anyone can get any ERC-20 token listed with just a few clicks. It’s subject to verification by the exchange staff, but in general the barrier of entry is far lower than what it used to be during the ICO bubble.\n\nThis means that all the new projects are first traded on Bitforex’s EasySwap before they hit the exchanges, if ever. The price of the tokens on EasySwap is influenced by the amount of tokens in the pool, which means you can possibly get a good bargain and arbitrage the hell out of it.\n\nSign up at Bitforex\n\nSummary\n\nBitforex is a new Asian outfit that is the place to be for trading the latest altcoins.\n\nIf you just want to trade the biggies or perpetual swap, try one of these places:\n\n\n  FTX (bitcoin and altcoin perps) - has KYC for withdrawals over 1k USD\n  Deribit (large-cap crypto futures, options) - has KYC\n  Phemex (perps, bonuses and competitions) - no KYC\n\n",

The next tier KYC gives you up to 9000 USD daily withdrawals. Full verification at FTX.com has unlimited withdrawals as well as fiat access both ways.\n\nThe KYC process is quick and mostly automated, similar to what Deribit does.

It was set up only very recently.\n\nIf you are a US resident, FTX will want you to stick to the US platform and the markets they offer there.\n\nSadly, what FTX offers to US traders is limited to your usual crypto spot markets and a few fiat forex pairs for arbitrage traders.\n\nOn the flip side, your no-KYC limit is higher at the US platform. Traders at FTX.us are only required to pass KYC with lifetime crypto withdrawals exceeding 10.000 USD.\n\nAlso, the trading interface has better features for active traders than your usual US platform. If you are American at some place mid-tier with your trading (not strictly OTC or a yield fund, but not exactly an amateur retail trader either), you will like trading at FTX.\n\n\n\nFTX.us markets\n\n\n  crypto spot\n  basic fiat forex pairs such as AUDUSD\n\n\nOther FTX.us products\n\n\n  stable fiat and stablecoin onramps and offramps\n  user interface ready for serious traders\n\n\nGet 5% off at FTX.us\n\nTrading on FTX\n\nFTX is aiming at traders who like their perpetual swap but are also not afraid to try new markets.\n\nThe user interface was very obviously designed for altcoin traders, arbers and anyone else who moves around different currencies, crypto or fiat.\n\n\n\nYour charts at FTX are from TradingView, which is to say the best you can get.\n\nTo sum it up, I’d reiterate what was said about the US branch of FTX: If you are somewhere mid-tier with your trading and not into options, you will like trading at FTX.\n\n\nGet 5% off at FTX.com\n&nbsp;\nGet 5% off at FTX.us\n\n\nIf you just want to trade your perps without getting into KYC though, maybe just go for one of these places:\n\n\n  Bitforex (bitcoin and altcoin perps) - has KYC for withdrawals over 1k USD\n  Phemex (perps, bonuses and competitions) - no KYC\n\n\n\n\nCrypto trading bot for FTX\n\nOn-Platform: FTX Quant Zone\n\nFTX provides a native interface for simple programmatic trading - the FTX quant zone.\n\nHere is an example of what it looks like from the strategy post on VPVR trading:\n\n\n\nIt is worth pointing out that the FTX market on which you set up your trigger does not need to be the same as the market on which you execute your order.\n\n\n  A simple example: Let’s say, you own BTC, you want to buy a BTCUSD bounce but you also want to limit your potential losses in case you’re wrong. In this case you could set up a trigger on the spot market and direct it to act on BTC perpetual swap with a stop loss, or you can direct it to buy a call option. FTX global does support options trading.\n  A market timing example: FTX provides several basket indices to work with: You can trade on the comparison of a single market vs an index. More on that in market timing article.\n  You could also work out a relationship between crypto and stocks, and direct the action to one of FTX’s tokenized stock markets…Tons of possibilities here.\n\n\n5% fee off with FTX promo code: altcointrading\n\nThird-Party Bots\n\nThe on-platform tool does not provide much more than arithmetic operators though. You can do a lot with them, but you’ve got to be a bit of a nerd.\n\nYou won’t get to trade on ready-made technical indicators there. Scalping strategies would be a struggle there, even though scalping is generally easy to automate. Likewise, creating rules based on multiple markets would be tedious, especially for portfolio rebalancing where values depend on one other.\n\nFor more than the very basic bot trading on FTX use either Shrimpy or Coinrule trading bot.\n\n\n\nSHRIMPY: Auto-DCA, Portfolio Management and Asset Allocation\n\nIf you want to DCA into small alt coins, set up a portfolio-wide stop loss or automate your portfolio rebalancing, the better choice for you is Shrimpy.\n\nShrimpy added FTX in October 2021, traders can start auto-trading there after linking Shrimpy and FTX via API keys.\n\n\n  AltcoinTrading.NET readers get 30% off on Shrimpy plans\n\n\nThis is what the auto-DCA looks like in Shrimpy:\n\n\n\n\n\nCOINRULE: FTX bot trading based on technical indicators\n\nCoinrule is the crypto trading bot platform that lets you automate trade execution based on the value of technical indicators.\n\nCoinrule, just like Shrimpy, is a no-coding bot platform. Here is what it looks like to program spot buying crypto any time its RSI hits oversold, and starts scaling back out of it at 10% of profit.\n\n\n  Coinrule gives a free trial\n\n\n\n\nWho is running FTX?\n\nFTX is pretty new in business: The international platform launched in early 2020, the US shop is even younger. The exchange duo is quickly gaining trust in the community though. Even though it is still lesser known among small retail traders, it’s adjusted traded volume is among the highest in the industry.\n\nYou will not find any Twitter celebrity working at FTX, but crypto traders who have been around longer than one bull run will recognize the name Zane Tackett, who now leads business development at FTX.\n\nZane Tackett is the former public face of Bitfinex who started his career in Beijing at the time when crypto industry was just barely a thing yet.\n\nNeedless to say that Bitfinex and Binance are among FTX’s business partners.\n\n\n\n\n",

      title: "Cryptowatch 2022 Review: Make the most of this free crypto charting tool!",
      content: "Cryptowatch is one of the the real OG tools for crypto traders that started as an independent project but was later acquired by Kraken exchange. That acquisition fortunately did not change much from the users’ point of view and now, Cryptowatch is one of the most popular crypto charting and trading platforms.\n\nUnlike Tensorcharts, they did not go the way of developing high-tech functionalities for dedicated crypto traders. Instead, Cryptowatch has become a platform where most crypto investors and most technical analysts can get just what they need for either no cost or quite a low monthly fee.\n\nIn this article we’ll explain where on Cryptowatch to do the basic chart watching, then moving on to the advanced stuff, which technical analysis tools on Cryptowatch are rare and a pretty good bang for your buck, and eventually for the spreadsheet people and arbers we’ll point out the data tools that Cryptowatch offers for a small fee.\n\nThe Basics\n\nCryptowatch Desktop App: Good for Baby-sitting\n\n\n\nIf you are crypto OG enough, you will remember the one thing that Cryptowatch users would complain about: The memory consumption.\n\nIf you let a chart up for a bit, the site would get slow and sluggish and some laptops would even start overheating.\n\nGood news is that the desktop app fixes this.\n\nIf what you’re interested in is having a chart up (perhaps because you’re waiting for an entry or exit point with your trade), the desktop app is built for that.\n\nIt will not fry your laptop because it consumes very little resources. Look at the screenshot of htop.\n\n\n\nSee the CPU and MEM column? That is very lightweight.\n\nThe downside is that the desktop version does not yet have the same range of functionalities as the web app, not the way it is today.\n\nBut that’s fine - it serves the good purpose of having a lightweight app with realtime candlesticks chart that you can just keep running for as long as you need.\n\n\n  Go to Cryptowatch Desktop download\n\n\nCryptowatch for Portfolio Tracking\n\nFor those of you who are not active traders or technical analysts, Cryptowatch can work as a portfolio tracker with a neat Bitgur-style heatmap showing your asset allocations, as a chart watching app with reliable price alerts and as a community.\n\n\n\nTo use Cryptowatch for real-time portfolio tracking, you just need to generate a read-only API key on your exchange and copy-paste it.\n\nIt is a good practice to use read-only API access if you are not planning to trade from the interface, but Cryptowatch gets bonus points for not even letting you set up the API access without enabling MFA first.\n\nSupported exchanges include all the good shops that you already use:\n\n  Kraken, Bitfinex, Binance, Binance US, FTX, FTX US, Coinbase Pro are among those available for both portfolio monitoring or trading\n  OKEx and some other trading platforms can be used only to track portfolio\n\n\nFor Kraken and Coinbase Pro a CSV export of all trades is available for your personal stats and the tax man.\n\n\n  Go to Cryptowatch portfolio tracking\n\n\nTrollbox\n\nDo people still do that? It’s not 2017, but anyway, Cryptowatch has a trollbox split into sub-communities by chat topic (Not by market!).\n\nIf you often cruise on Reddit &amp; Co to see what the mood in the community is like, Cryptowatch is not a bad place to add to your list. Relatively genuine and shill-free.\n\nOne good thing to mention is that by participating in the chat, you earn credits that you can then use towards real-time price alerts or API data.\n\nThe Advanced\n\nTechnical analysis: Stock-to-flow, Volume profile, niche TA\n\nThe functionalities of the Cryptowatch web app are much more rich than what you can get in the desktop app.\n\nNot necessarily, advanced, Cryptowatch is very beginner-friendly if you stick with defaults, but there is a lot of things to explore and backtest, if that’s what you want to do.\n\nYou probably already know that you can execute trades directly from Cryptowatch - just generate the right kind of API keys on your exchange.\n\n\n\nAs for technical analysis, you don’t get a full public library of programmable pine scripts the way you do with TradingView.\n\nYou do get much more than just basic TA tools on a cute chart, though.\n\n\n\nVolume Profile and Market Profile on Cryptowatch\n\nThis is something that deserves much more raving than it’s getting, but Cryptowatch implemented volume-based indicators and made them accessible in the free version.\n\nThe only catch is you need to know what to look for.\n\n\n\nStep 1 - Click on “Analysis” in the top right-hand corner of a chart and look for volume profile.\n\nStep 2 - You will see two options there: Grouping by traded volume and grouping by time spent at price level.\n\nBoth these options are already pretty well known  statistical tools created decades ago for stock trading.\n\nThere’s an option to use both at the same time, on either side of the chart.\n\nVolume at price level\n\nIf you choose the volume-based profile, you will get a good equivalent of the volume profile of visible range, or VPVR, for exactly 0 USD monthly.\n\nMore on volume trading tools in our glossary:\n\n  Volume Trading Hub\n  VPVR\n\n\nTime spent at price level\n\nThe time-based profile is a lot less opaque, I’m sure. But the principle of this statistical tool is the market profile theory developed (and trademarked) by J. Peter Steidlmayer who wrote a short book that explains very well how it works.\n\nI would really encourage technical traders and analysts to read up on market profile.\n\nYour usual TA tools do not work with time at all other than averaging something over a number of periods, so adding a time-based tool could really make it easier for you to read what the market is doing in times of doubt.\n\nNow that it’s so easily available on Cryptowatch, it should really be a no-brainer.\n\nMore on market profile trading in our glossary:\n\n  Market Profile\n\n\nOther interesting TA tools on Cryptowatch\n\n\n  Stock to Flow Indicator\n  Arnaud Legoux Moving Average (ALMA)\n  Average directional movement and similar indexes\n\n\nThe Data\n\nGoogle Spreadsheet Add-On Cryptofinance, Zapier and other paid tools\n\n\n\nLast but not least, paid tools.\n\nCryptowatch has an API with data that can be pretty hard to come by, especially when it comes to crypto derivative data. It’s really only fair that these are not available for free. And to be honest, it is nice they chose to make the data paid instead of nagging you to pay up when you want to add a second technical indicator, like TradingView.\n\nThe Cryptofinance spreadsheet add-on &amp; other extras\n\nIf you do cash-and-carry or other trades that mix futures or options and spot, realtime price data feed of the crypto derivative is something you have probably been missing. There aren’t any tools to get price data of small markets into a spreadsheet, other than manual input.\n\nSo, Cryptowatch actually has a tool that does that.\n\nYou can pull any Cryptowatch data directly into your Google Spreadsheet arb calculator or send it anywhere else through a Zapier app.\n\nThe cost of that will typically come to about 25 USD monthly, paid as you go in Cryptowatch credits. For comparison, 25 USD is worth about 2500 Cryptowatch credits.\n\nFor that you get a readymade tool, though - not just the usual API access.\n\nCryptowatch runs a Google Sheets addon called Cryptofinance that you can add into your spreadsheet and use for any kind of crypto market data in a manner that is similar to Google Finance add-on.\n\nWith that, it’s just a few clicks to build your arbitrage opportunity calculators and portfolio trackers inside a Google Sheet.\n\nThe price tag of 25 USD surely justifies that for an active trader.\n\n\n  Go to Cryptofinance\n\n\n\n",

      title: "Monero Wallets: Your options in 2022 (updated)",
      content: "Current situation with Monero wallets:\n\n\n  Ledger wallets support Monero via a XMR app that you can install through Ledger live.\n  MyMonero wallet is still the top choice for desktop XMR wallets. MyMonero now has an Android app too.\n  Cakewallet is the top choice for software wallets on macbooks and iPhones, but it has an Android app too now.\n  Out of the popular multicoin wallets, Exodus wallet now supports Monero.\n\n\nI’ve put the frequently search questions regarding XMR storage to the bottom. The most important thing to note though: If you find a new wallet for XMR that has features you want to try out, please first verify that it is legitimate.\n\nSeeing if a XMR wallet is fraudulent or legitimate is really easy thanks to Monero’s community on Reddit.\n\nMonero has an active and well moderated community on Reddit, so all you need to do is to go to r/Monero and search the subreddit for the name of your wallet.\n\nHow to validate that your XMR wallet choice is legit\n\n\n  \n    Step 1 - Open r/Monero\n\n    r/Monero is the official subreddit of XMR currency. The top moderator, Fluffypony, is the creator of the cryptocurrency. Sethforprivacy (last in the mod list) is a well known engineer and privacy expert.\n\n    \n  \n  \n    Step 2 - Locate the search bar in the top of the page and type in the name of the XMR wallet you want to check.\n\n    \n  \n  \n    Step 3 - Press enter to search the subreddit.\n\n    I went with Freewallet.\n\n    The latest results are showing that Freewallet is not trusted by the community, and that Binance exchange is proposed to be added into the same category.\n\n    If you were planning to buy XMR, consider doing so on some other exchange than Binance.\n\n    \n  \n\n\nMonero Wallets: Recommended setup\n\nThe recommended setup with mobile Monero wallets is the same as with any crypto or with NFTs:\n\n\n  Use a Monero smartphone or software wallet to carry small amount of XMR\n    \n      ( recommended ~ MyMonero.com or Exodus )\n    \n  \n  Use a Monero cold storage solution to store the bigger part of the stash\n    \n      ( recommended ~ Ledger wallet )\n    \n  \n\n\nMyMonero wallet is here the most trusted desktop and smartphone XMR wallet because it was developed by the creator of the currency. MyMonero is now available as a smartphone Monero wallet app and a desktop wallet for Mac, Windows and Linux.\n\nFluffypony (the creator of the Monero currency) said long ago there were plans for official Android and iOS apps done as user-friendly apps that will connect to a remote node, so that you would not have to set up your own full nodes and sync them.\n\nThat is now finally possible and it opened up avenues for other legitimate wallet integration like Ledger or Exodus.\n\nGo to MyMonero\n\nThe same story happened with Trezor and Ledger integration There have been years of plans and announcements about hardware wallets intergations of Monero, but the problem was the Monero blockchain needed a special integration, which was expensive, and on top of that kept evolving. The hardware wallet app would have been obsolete very soon.\n\nEventually, we got Ledger supporting Monero.\n\nLedger Nano X\n\nFrequently searched questions\n\n\n  \n    Is Freewallet a good XMR wallet?\n\n    No. Once again, avoid Freewallet, the app holds users’ private keys and there have been multiple scam accusations.\n  \n  \n    Is MyMonero legitimate?\n\n    Mymonero.com is legitimate and maintained by the XMR core team. No other TLD alternatives of MyMonero are legitimate other than mymonero dot com.\n  \n  \n    Is there an Electrum wallet for Monero?\n\n    Electrum, the famous Bitcoin light wallet, does not support Monero.\n\n    A prehistoric version of Monero used to be similar to Bitcoin enough to be stored in a Bitcoin wallet, but those days are long gone.\n  \n  \n    Do you need to run Monero Full Node to store Monero?\n\n    No, not any longer.\n\n    Of course if you want to, you can run a Monero full node. In terms of security, running own Monero node is the best option. The official XMR node client is available from getmonero.com.\n  \n\n\nAbout Monero\n\nMonero is one of the altcoins that cannot be called shitcoin:\n\n\n  private and untraceable\n  trustless setup\n  developers are not just in for the quick buck\n\n\nBut for the longest time, if you wanted to LTH Monero, the only hassle-free way was the dodgy setup of money on the exchange.\n\nSince the Bitfinex hack in August 2016 and many other hacks since, people keep casually guessing which crypto platform will get attacked next.\n\nFortunately, the situation has changed lately and it’s getting easier to get user-friendly Monero wallets.\n\nStill, it is best to always check the opinions on your wallet and exchange of choice by searching the XMR community on Reddit: Monero is an untraceable currency and as such, it will be always a green pasture for all sorts of cybercrime.\n",

      title: "Altcoin Wallets: Tried and True. Unhosted wallets for 2022 crypto world (NFTs, DeFi, Staking)",
      content: "Lets kick this article about altcoin wallets right off with the obligatory reminders. Apologies if these are not new to you.\n\n\n  For hodlers: It is not a good idea to keep your cryptocurrencies on an exchange.\n\n\nDoes it sound like FUD. Well, exchanges are targeted by cyber criminals more than individuals, they hold larger amounts of crypto. DeFi is the primary target since its inception and crypto exchanges are no longer run by amateurs, but it is a plain fact that one of the latest exchange hacks happened in early 2022 when AscendEX lost 77 million dollars. In the past, we had the Tether hack in 2017, the DAO hack in 2016 and the infamous Bitfinex hack in 2016.\n\n\n  For traders: It is not a good idea to send cryptocurrency from one exchange to another.\n\n\nCrypto exchanges are not banks. If you send LTC, let’s say, from your Bitstamp account to your Bitfinex account, it has a regulatory impact. Bitstamp would do what normally only companies with banking license can do: They would be sending your money on your behalf between two financial institutions.\n\nExchanges detect such transactions and may trash them. You can go spend months dealing with customer support to retrieve your funds, sure. But you might have better things to do.\n\n\n  For everyone: There are ongoing phishing attacks looking for any popular crypto wallet owners.\n\n\nThis post lists out some useful habits to build to protect yourself against phishing because way too many people still fall for it even though they know they shouldn’t click on anything without thinking first.\n\n\n\nAltcoin Wallets: Top Of The Market\n\n\n  \n    \n      Hardware\n      \n        Ledger Nano X / S Plus\n        \n        Top Commercial Hardware Wallets\n      \n      (+ NFTs, Staking)\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Free\n      \n        Exodus Crypto Wallet\n        \n        Top Free Wallet App\n      \n      (+ NFTs, Staking)\n    \n  \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLedger wallets are the most popular hardware wallets. Trezor develops technically really interesting products with Shamir seeds and all, but ultimately, Trezor wallets are so expensive and not getting any cheaper as time passes.\n\nMore in sync with everyone’s preferences in the recession, Ledger in 2022 released a new version of the Ledger wallet - the Nano S Plus. This model is very much like the old Ledger Nano, except it has much larger storage capacity. On the Nano S you won’t be able to run more than 3 crypto wallets at the same time.\n\nThe Nano S Plus can take 100 of them at once, at a prize point that is only a tad over the Nano S and not almost twice as much like the Nano X. So this is great for all your DeFi trading and staking needs.\n\nNeedless to say, Ledger Nano S Plus promptly went out of stock a few weeks after launch.\n\n\n  Check the Ledger Nano S Plus at the Ledger store.\n\n\nYou might also try your luck with a local authorized reseller and buy your Ledger Nano S Plus there. Always check that your reseller is authorized by Ledger, though. Just click through to the official list at Ledger’s website and find a store near you.\n\n\n  Here is the list of authorized retailers provided by Ledger.\n\n\nLedger Nano X: The best choice (and always in stock)\n\nEveryone’s Favorite Commercial Altcoin Wallet is and has been the Ledger Nano X.\n\nThe market has spoken. Ledger Nano X can be called the best cryptocurrency wallet that’s currently out there. It has limitations, but for the day to day use it has everything you need as a trader or hodler.\n\n\nGo to Ledger\n&nbsp;\nDeals from Black Friday\n\n\n\n  \n    Ledger Supports Staking\n\n    You can stake from a Ledger wallet, too, although Exodus may be better for that. We have a full guide on crypto staking wallets, pools, providers and exchanges.\n  \n  \n    Ledger Supports NFTs\n\n    If you trade or collect NFTs, you can store them on your Ledger wallet. You can use the Exodus or Phantom wallet apps as a UI but still store your private keys on Ledger. It’s a bit more secure than storing your keys on your laptop, and you’ll get a nice NFT gallery. Ledger.com provides a guide on how to store NFTs here.\n  \n  \n    Good compromise between security and usability\n\n    Ledger Live app: Control your assets and wallet updates through the dedicated Ledger Live application. The app alerts you on updates, so you can safely disregard any update alerts you will get per email. This protects you from phishing.\n\n    For BTC and LTC, both legacy and segwit address are supported. You can generate and access all address formats in Ledger Live.\n  \n  \n    Easy Coin Control tool for BTC’s fungibility\n\n    All Ledger wallets suppport Coin Control.\n\n    Coin control is a tool implemented in the Ledger Live application. It lets you choose which incoming transactions to spend from when you are sending money out.\n\n    This way you can separate your KYC and non-KYC purchases of crypto, even if you mixed then up and sent them all to the same address.\n\n    Learn about coin control in the glossary.\n  \n\n\nShould you get Nano X or Nano S?\n\nLedger were the pioneers of supporting altcoins, and you will find most new cryptocurrencies are implemented quickly. It’s part of their ethos. You will get over 100 supported cryptocurrencies on any model of Ledger wallet: All the big crypto, all the dino alts, most of DeFi, most of NFTs. Full list of supported coins at Ledger.com.\n\nLedger Nano X is better than Ledger Nano S for active alt coin traders because of its larger memory capacity. A Nano X can house private keys of many more cryptocurrencies than Ledger Nano S.\n\nOn the other hand, Nano X is vastly more expensive. If you only want to get the better model for the increased storage capacity, try to get your hands on the Nano S Plus.\n\nThe Nano S Plus has big enough capacity but no extra frills, which makes it cheaper.\n\n\n  Check Ledger Nano S Plus availability here or select a local reseller from the official list.\n\n\nLedger Wallets: What you need to know before you buy\n\n\n  \n    The bad: 2020 data breach\n\n    In 2020, Ledger company suffered a database breach that leaked emails and physical locations of customers. Since second half of 2020, there has been an ongoing phishing attack directed to the leaked e-mail addresses.\n\n    To protect yourself:\n    \n      Use a package drop-off location, not your home address. Ordering to your office building is a better option.\n      Order from a disposable email address.\n      Instead of from ledger.com, buy your Ledger Nano X from a small, local, authorised reseller instead: Once again, here is the list. Resellers cover smaller part of the market and are less appealing to cybercriminals.\n    \n  \n  \n    The ugly: Don’t buy full price\n\n    Both Ledger Nano S and Ledger nano S get cheaper in bundle packs by 2 or 3 and during Black Friday.\n\n    Bundle offers are available throughout the year from the official Ledger store (sadly, not via resellers).\n\n    The best deals do come around Black Friday but Ledger runs some sort of deal at most times of the year. You just need to look for it in the e-shop.\n  \n  \n    The good: Memory size\n\n    Ledger Nano X and Ledger Nano S Plus have larger memory capacity than Ledger Nano S. That means you can easily hold dozens of alt coins on a single Ledger device with those models.\n\n    If you only want to hold 1-3 cryptocurrencies, save your money and buy the cheaper Nano S. There’s not much difference between the two other than in design and memory size.\n  \n\n\nSummary\n\n\n  Supported Coins: Most - BTC, ETH, LTC, XRP, ZEC &amp; more; also all ERC20 tokens, SOL tokens and any unexotic NFTs\n  Segwit addresses: Both native and nested Segwit wallets (bech32 and P2SH) supported as subaccounts in Ledger Live\n  Staking directly in wallet\n  Easy coin control\n  No message signatures\n\n\n\nGet Ledger Nano X\n&nbsp;\nGet Ledger Nano S Plus\n&nbsp;\nGet Ledger Nano S\n\n\n\n\nEasy-to-use &amp; Free: Smartphone Crypto Wallet Apps\n\nTop multi-coin wallet apps available for iPhone and Android:\n\n\n  Exodus wallet app\n  Jaxx wallet app\n  Blockchain.com wallet\n\n\n\n\nExodus Multicoin Wallet and Staking Wallet\n\n\n\nGet it at exodus.com\n\nExodus is a multicoin wallet for deskop and smartphone with an integrated swap exchange inside the app.\n\nIn its desktop version, Exodus supports staking directly from the wallet.\n\nExodus is well time-testedm, and currently your best option for a free multicoin wallet:\n\n\n  Exodus provides a staking wallet to earn income from PoS cryptocurrencies (Tezos, Cosmos, VeChain)\n  The amount of supported coins  is the largest (130 cryptocurrencies in 2021).\n  Exodus supports Monero.\n  For Bitcoin, both legacy and segwit addresses are supported You automatically get a pair of legacy (1-address) and segwit addresses (bc-address, bech32 native segwit) so that you can always withdraw no matter what address type your exchange supports.\n  The customer support is great and you get a status page to check in case your app gets sluggish.\n  There is a swap exchange inside the app.\n  Exodus also integrates with hardware wallets (Ledger, Trezor).\n\n\n\n\nThe Exodus wallet app is super user-friendly. It won’t let you do anything too technical, but it is great for beginners. You can even stake your PoS altcoins through Exodus without any technical understanding.\n\nHow to set up Exodus for the first time\n\n\n  Launch the wallet as any other app, there is no user sign up. You can start by recovering a wallet from seedphrase but you don’t have to.\n  As there are over 100 altcoins supported, you need to enable wallet functionality for coins you want to store.\n  Altcoin wallets are generated for you without giving you their seed phrase yet.\n  To backup your seedphrase, navigate to the backup section of the app and write down the seed phrase it shows you.\n  The only owner of your private keys is you. Without the seed phrase backup, Exodus cannot recover your cryptocurrency. Do not forget to back up your seed phrase!\n\n\n\n\nStablecoins supported by Exodus\n\nExodus wallets are under ceaseless development, new cryptocurrencies as well as functionalities are added all the time. At the moment, the stablecoins supported by Exodus are the following:\n\n\n  USDt (Tether) in ERC20 transport protocol\n  USDC (USDCOIN)\n  TUSD (TrueUSD)\n  GUSD (Gemini Dollar)\n\n\n\n\nThe nice touches you get in every Exodus wallet\n\n\n  The BTC wallet in Exodus can generate new BTC addresses after each receiving transaction, so that you don’t reuse addresses and don’t have to worry about coin control\n  The Exodus app supports passcode lock and, if your device supports that, fingerprint lock.\n  the staking through the desktop add-on goes to Exodus’ own pool with better rates than what you often get on exchanges.\n\n\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n  Supported Coins: BTC, ETH, ERC20 tokens, Tezos, EOS, XRP, TRX… = 110 cryptoassets in total\n  Segwit addresses: BTC Native segwit supported (bech32 wallet)\n  Staking available from wallet\n  No advanced functions (coin control, message signatures)\n\n\n\n\nJaxx Multicoin Wallet\n\n\n\nGet it at jaxx.io\n\nJaxx is still one of the most popular multicoin wallets these days is Jaxx. It is available as browser extension, desktop app and mobile app.\n\nJaxx wallet is user-friendly and good for beginners:\n\n  You launch the wallet as any other app, no user sign up.\n  Wallets are automatically generated for you. No seed handling right at the start.\n  To see your private keys (seed phrase), you need to run backup. Backup options is available even if you do not have any crypto in your wallet yet. You will find the Backup option under Settings on the right hand side.\n  The only owner of your private keys is you.\n  Do not forget backing up your seed phrase!\n\n\nSince Jaxx 1.2 you get Shapeshift exchange integrated within the wallet.\n\nSummary\n\n\n  Supported coins: BTC, ETH, ERC20 via MyEtherWallet, ETC, DASH, LTC, REP, RSK, ZEC… = 90 cryptoassets in total\n  Segwit addresses: Not supported (legacy wallets only)\n  No advanced functions (coin control, message signatures)\n\n\n\n\nBlockchain.com Wallet for BTC, ETH and XLM\n\nIf you only need to store BTC, ETH and XLM, the simplest smartphone app for you is the blockchain.com wallet (formerly blockchain.info).\n\n\n  The smartphone app can be unlocked with PIN or fingerprint.\n  You automatically get the Blockchain.com web wallet access. It is a web wallet, which is less secure, but it has several levels of MFA (multi-factor authentication) and a whitelist option.\n  The Blockchain.com wallet offers ID verification option for your account. Verified users get access to airdrops, fiat-to-crypto exchange and ETH staking wallet.\n\n\nBe careful though: The blockchain.com wallet is the favorite target of imposter attacks. Always double check you are downloading the app from developer company Blockchain Luxembourg SARL.\n\nSummary\n\n\n  Supported Coins: BTC, ETH, XLM\n  Segwit addresses: Not supported (legacy wallet only)\n  No advanced functions at all (coin control, message signatures)\n\n\n\n\nSpecial cases: Single-Coin Crypto Wallets\n\nThere are two reasons to use a single coin wallet:\n\nYour coin is too novel to be implemented in multicoin wallets…\n\n…Or you want top notch privacy and security.\n\nSome really novel cryptocurrencies were not supported by the popular multi-coin wallets like Jaxx or Exodus for the longest time, because they run on a ledger that is too difficult to integrate.\n\nThese usually have their own dedicated wallet apps for desktops and smartphones.\n\nWe will also mention two Bitcoin-only wallets that implement special privacy features. These choose not to implement altcoin support in order to keep their security tighter.\n\n\n  MyMonero - XMR web and app wallet\n  Trinity - IOTA app wallet\n  Samourai - BTC private app wallet\n  Coldcard - BTC private hardware wallet\n\n\n\n\nMyMonero Lightweight Wallet\n\n\n\nGet it at mymonero.com\n\nMyMonero has been long endorsed on the Monero’s official website (getmonero.com).\n\nMyMonero was originally only available as a web wallet. In 2020 you get the monero web wallet and a desktop/smartphone app.\n\nThe MyMonero wallet is super simple.\n\n  To use it, you don’t have to sign up. Just access the app or website and start the mnemonic phrase generation.\n  The mnemonic phrase is your private key.\n  Your private key is not stored anywhere on the server, you are its sole owner. The danger is, you need to type in your seed into the web interface to access your wallet.\n\n\nIf you don’t want to use MyMonero, you have other options - read here.\n\n\n\nIOTA Trinity Wallet App\n\n\n\nGet it at  trinity.iota.org\n\nTrinity is a relatively new release, and the first IOTA wallet that works without weird high-tech settings hacks. Trinity is the official wallet for IOTA and it is a desktop and smartphone app.\n\nUsing Trinity is easy and great for beginners (not that you’d have much choice though) but you can still enable advanced, more technical mode.\n\n\n  The app starts with the option to either use a private key or to generate a new one.\n  If you are generating a new key, Trinity will force you to write it down and then TYPE IT BACK instead of copypasting it. This is good for security (but a pain in the a$$ because IOTA seeds are not mnemonic).\n  The sync of the transactions is a bit sluggish but in general there is less of the problem with vanishing histories that we knew from previous IOTA wallets.\n\n\nIn-depth guide: How to secure your IOTA wallet.\n\n\n\nSamourai wallet - BTC wallet app for privacy\n\nGet it at  samouraiwallet.com\n\nSamourai is a privacy-focused Bitcoin wallet with bitcoin mixing capability “coinjoin”.\n\nThis is not a post about Bitcoin wallets, and Samourai will be an overkill for traders who just need something easy to move money around.\n\nBut there are certain situations that would warrant the use of a wallet like Samourai.\n\nExchanges like Coinbase and Kraken check for the history of the coins you deposit and will make you trouble if your bitcoins were on the darknet or a casino site before.\n\nThese policies may cause you trouble when you try to take profit from crypto you earned trading on no-KYC exchanges, such as (formerly) BitMEX, Bitfinex or OKEx.\n\nThat’s when you could use Samourai wallet and it’s Staggered Ricochet function.\n\n\n\nColdcard mk3 - BTC hardware wallet for security\n\n\n\nGet it at the official coinkite store\n\nColdcard is one of the less mainstream but more secure bitcoin wallets.\n\nThis is an altcoin trading website, but if you have a stash of BTC for the long run that you don’t trade with, consider giving Coldcard a shot.\n\nIt’s one of the wallets that solves the real issues. The hardware is put together with some sense, the chip has a secure element, the device is compatible with all usual app wallets.\n\n\n\nWhat’s the secure element good for?\n\nSecure element encrypts what is stored in it. That means that without the PIN there is no access to the seed.\n\nEven in case of brute-force, sec chip only gives you 13 tries before bricking itself.\n\nAnd then in Coldcard particularly, there is one more layer for the case that the sec chip would have a vulnerability discovered: Coldcard encrypts the contents of the sec chip with an additional key stored in a different part of the hardware.\n\nFive dollar wrench attack protection\n\nThe best of Coldcard, though, is the suite of tools it provides for duress situations.\n\n\n  \n    Duress PIN\n\n    Coldcard has the option to set up a second PIN number. On entering it, the device will load a different wallet, which is however generated from the same seed as your real wallet.\n\n    You can access it whenever and even send some money in and out of it to make it look genuine.\n  \n  \n    25th word\n This is a feature known from Trezor wallets. Using BIP39 seeds of 24 words, there is an option to set any number of additional words that will generate distraction wallets.\n\n    This is also useful as separate financial accounts if you want to use Coldcard in business.\n  \n  Brick-Me PIN\n Upon entering a brick-me PIN, the device destroys its sec chip and is rendered worthless.\n  \n    Brick-Me Countdown\n In addition to manually entering a brick-me PIN, you can set a timer for it. This is NOT a dead man’s switch: Once set, you can’t break the countdown once it’s started.\n\n    It is meant to be a device for plausible deniability - you submitted a functional device, you were not present when it broke down.\n  \n\n\nThe latest model, Coldcard MK3, is available at the CoinKite store with a 5% off for payments in BTC.\n\n\n\nWhat to Choose: Hardware Wallets or Desktop and Smartphone Wallets?\n\nHardware wallets are commercial, desktop or phone wallets are free.\n\nBut if you are planning to hold an altcoin for more than one year, you should really get a hardware wallet.\n\nYou will still need to keep it updated, but in your case you are still getting the best security even from basic setups.\n\nThe reason is that your chances of messing up something or getting hacked are minimal if you have the private key on any dedicated device simply thanks to the fact that you don’t use the device on a daily basis.\n\nThe easiest black-box choice here is a commercial hardware wallet device. But if you are a geek, you can absolutely have a smartphone wallet on a dedicated smartphone. That is, a device you don’t use for anything else. Using dedicated devices to store crypto is the so-called tiered storage method.\n\nIf you want to hodl your BTC holdings only, you can do Electrum wallet on a dedicated laptop.\n\n\n\nLedger Wallet for Altcoins\n\nIt seems unbelievable now, but back in 2016 Ledger Wallet used to claim they would not support any altcoins.\n\nThey obviously started adding altcoin support to Nano S with the first altcoin bubble in 2017.\n\n\n  Nano S is not the best option though, because it has a limited memory capacity and can only hold one or two different crypto wallets.\n  A single Ledger Nano X is way better in this aspect.\n  You might still prefer Nano S if you want to split your holdings into multiple devices. There are bundles available.\n\n\nNative Support: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Monero, Ethereum Classic, Dogecoin, Litecoin, Zcash, Dash, Ripple, Stratis.\n\nVia 3rd party private key management: All Ethereum tokens of the ERC20 standard. All ETH tokens can be managed using Ledger Nano S and Ledger Blue with MyEtherWallet.\n\nOn Reddit:\n\n\n  Subreddit - r/ledgerwallet/\n  People - u/btchip\n\n\n\nGet Ledger Nano X\n&nbsp;\nCurrent Bundle Offers\n\n\nSummary\n\nSupported Coins: Many - BTC, ETH, XRP LTC, XRP, ZEC &amp; more; also all ERC20 tokens\n\nSegwit addresses: Both native and nested Segwit supported (bech32 and P2SH)\n\nTrezor wallet for Altcoins\n\nTrezor is not as popular as Ledger because it’s slightly more expensive and doesn’t do much in the way of marketing. It is technically not a worse choice though. Especially the new Trezor T with Shamir seeds is the bleeding edge of crypto hardware right now.\n\nFrom the user’s point of view, Trezor utilizes a similar system as the Ledger Wallet.\n\nThere is a set of native apps, you are able to manage several cryptocurrency wallets from a web app after unlocking your access with your PIN.\n\n\n  TREZOR supports natively: BTC, ETH, DASH, LTC, ZEC…\n  Via 3rd party private key management: Any ERC20 token via MyEtherWallet\n  In total (native + 3rd party), Trezor wallets now support over 1000 cryptocurrencies\n  For BTC and LTC, both legacy and segwit addresses are supported.\n  Trezor wallet does not support staking directly but can be used with an AllNodes one-click app.\n\n\nTrezor developers take much longer time to implement new features by popular demand - for instance there is no staking directly from wallet and coin control is only to be implemented later in 2021 for the first time.\n\nOn the other hand, that can play into some cryptocurrency holders’ conservative approach. It is generally safe to assume that not rushing to implement every new feature makes the device less plagued by vulnerabilities.\n\n\nGo to Trezor shop\n&nbsp;\nBundle Offers with CryptoSteel\n\n\nTrezor Team On Reddit:\n\n\n  Subreddit - r/TREZOR\n  People - u/slush0, u/stickac\n\n\nSummary\n\nSupported Coins: Over 1000 - BTC, ETH, LTC, XRP, ZEC &amp; more; also all ERC20 tokens\n\nSegwit addresses: Both native and nested Segwit supported (bech32 and P2SH)\n\n \n\nElectrum for Altcoins: Be careful\n\nWhile Electrum for Bitcoin (https://electrum.org/) is a very safe option, you should be careful with Electrum for altcoins.\n\nThe altcoin spin-offs of Electrum are just “forks”. The Electrum code is open-source, which means anyone can create and publish a fork of it. These forks are not affiliated with the original Electrum code or its author.\n\nThey can well be full of malware, despite carrying the same “brand” name Electrum. That’s just how open-source software works.\n\nWeb Based Multi-Altcoin Wallets\n\nMost web-based wallets, the private keys are stored by a third party. You should not consider these as a safe altcoin storage.\n\nOpt for blockchain.com or one of the multicoin wallets for smartphones like Exodus or Jaxx for a good ratio of convenience and security.\n\nFurther reading\n\n\n  These days, just plain storing crypto is often not good enough. Most wallets mentioned in this article support crypto staking to earn you yield for storing your alt coins.\n  In case you are looking up wallets because you want to start trading, read our guide on the most common noob margin trading mistakes\n\n\nThis article was first ever published in February 2016 and has been continually updated.

      title: "MyCointainer Review - Delegation & Staking Made Easy",
      content: "MyCointainer.com is a staking service with headquarters in Estonia. The platform specialises in yield generation for cryptocurrencies through both custodial and non-custodial methods:\n\n\n  Cold-stake crypto by delegating it from your wallet to MyCointainer validators\n  Generate yield on your crypto through locked custodial staking\n  Earn free crypto via on-platform airdrops and bounties\n  Buy or sell crypto directly on platform\n\n\n\n\nIn this review, we will go through the process of buying crypto through MyCointainer staking platform and staking it.\n\nYou will get an overview of the staking services and a walkthrough to acquiring crypto with MyCointainer.\n\nYield-generating Tools on MyCointainer\n\nThe main product of MyCointainer is staking. The assets page lists all the options for crypto that you can stake by locking it up on the platform.\n\nYou will see some popular choices like USDC staking near the top of the list when you sort by popularity. But there are much smaller PoS cryptos supported as well.\n\n\n\nCustodial staking is where you get the highest reward rate, but also where you take a risk because you need to keep your crypto on the platform:\n\n\n\nIf you don’t want to take that risk, you can delegate your crypto for cold staking to validator nodes run by MyCointainer. The rates are still really good:\n\n\n\nRates retrieved 12 Jul 2022. Staking rewards fluctuate.\n\nBuying Crypto on MyCointainer: Payment methods\n\nMyCointainer offers a mixture of custodial and non-custodial services, but buying crypto is one of the custodial ones.\n\nBefore buying crypto, you need to throw some cash in your digital wallet and there are quite a few ways you can do it on MyCointainer.\n\nThe platform is registered in Estonia, so if you are in the EU, the SEPA bank transfer might be your fastest and pretty much zero-fee deposit method.\n\nFor instant or near-instant deposits, MyCointainer provides several ways to deposit their cash via other digital wallets.\n\nDigital wallet deposit availability depends on your location:\n\n  AdvCash, which is a popular digital wallet in Russian-speaking parts of the world\n  AliPay, the Chinese payment platform\n  iDeal, based in the Netherlands\n  Przelewy 24, the Polish e-commerce processor\n  GiroPay, the German online payments system\n\n\nAnd then there is the \"Faster Payments'' option that supports a quicker transfer for 17 more providers including digital-only banks like Revolut or the German neobank N26.\n\nSome of the other popular universal methods are wire transfers and credit/debit card deposits.\n\nOther Ways for When You Don’t Want To Buy: Airdrops, EarnBack and Referrals\n\nMyCointainer is a platform that targets the users who want to stake crypto but are just getting started and maybe don’t even have any.\n\nThat’s why the platform provides three options for those who are ready to invest a bit of their time rather than their money - airdrops, cashback and referral commission.\n\n\n  \n    The most popular option are crypto airdrops.\n\n    MyCointainer lists a few of them on their Airdrops Alerts page. As you can see on the page, all you need is a social media account and a few minutes of your time to participate in an airdrop.\n\n    Airdrops are one of the safest and easiest methods to earn free crypto these days. Most of them are time-sensitive, so pay attention to the deadline of the tasks needed to participate.\n\n    \n  \n  \n    Cashback via a Chrome add-on\n\n    On MyCointainer, you can also get cashback in crypto by installing the EarnBack Google Chrome extension.\n\n    Every time you shop online, you will get crypto cashback (up to 40% depending on the providers and the shopping category – accessories, electronics, groceries etc.).\n  \n  \n    Invite a friend\n\n    As soon as you make an account and log in, you will notice a banner about a referral program in your wallet.\n\n    It's a no-brainer – invite your friends to MyCointainer and you both will get a 15 EUR worth of a staking crypto.\n\n    If you have a lot of friends, this will be the fastest and most \"reliable\" way to get your rewards for free.\n  \n\n\nBuying crypto – Walkthrough\n\nHere's important info before you send money to your MyCointainer wallet: Their exchange purchase minimum is the 10 EUR equivalent of crypto. So basically, you can deposit as little as 1 EUR, but you won't be able to buy for it because it’s below the threshold.\n\n\n  \n    If this is your first time buying, deposit 10 EUR or more.\n\n    Once you have those 10 EUR in your wallet, you can pick any cryptocurrency you want, buy it and then stake in on platform or withdraw it. There are some pretty exotic options available.\n  \n  \n    MyCointainer has partnered with several coin foundations including Polygon.\n\n    This means that you should expect to get tokens as a bonus for your purchase. Here I am getting NULS and DOGE on 11th July 2022:\n\n    \n  \n  \n    If you have no idea which coin you want to buy, go to the assets page and sort it by popularity to see what coins can you stake on platform.\n\n    If you’ll leave your crypto on platform, your staking rewards will arrive to your wallet daily.\n\n    \n\n    If you bought for a few EUR like me it will be next to nothing, but it's nice to see that things have already started moving with the minimum effort from my side.\n  \n\n\nAnd that's pretty much it for getting you started. You can follow the value of your portfolio on the web or via the MyCointainer app.\n\nCutting your staking fees\n\nIf on the other hand you ever decide to hold more money on MyCointainer, you will probably need to also consider the fees. MyCointainer charges a cut on your staking profits, as do all staking platforms including exchanges like Coinbase or Bitfinex.\n\nUnlike exchanges, MyCointainer offers an option to cut your staking fees by upgrading your account. There are several “Power” tiers that can cap your fees for a monthly subscription payment, or remove your fees altogether.\n\n\n\nFinal words\n\nDespite all the ways to earn rewards available on the website, staking is the most profitable way of getting crypto on MyCointainer.\n\nOn the other hand, locked custodial staking is risky. If you don’t want to take that risk, you can choose to only take part in cold staking via MyCointainer’s validators. The rates there are fair and the selection of coins pretty good.\n",

      title: "LocalCryptos Review: Always no-KYC, Zero-Knowledge P2P exchange for big cryptos",
      content: "LocalCryptos is a decentralized marketplace for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dash, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash.\n\nIt is a much improved iteration on LocalBitcoins (not developed by the same people).\n\nWise, Paypal, Advcash, Skrill, Webmoney or Venmo are all supported at LocalCryptos, along with dozens other payment methods.\n\nMessage board, but with high tech on the inside\n\nAs far as the user is concerned, on the surface LocalCryptos look like just another “message board” exchange that’s really similar to LocalMonero or LocalBitcoins.\n\nOn the inside, LocalCryptos is fully decentralized though.\n\nCompared to that, the OG marketplace LocalBitcoins was and is in fact just a message board on a server that stores all your private messaging history with your vendors, including the media files you send when a vendor asks to see your identity card. On the old style message board P2P markets, all that data is accessible to the administrators who run the platform, or potentially to an ISP and and anyone else, including hackers.\n\nLocalCryptos is Zero-Knowledge\n\nUnlike the original message board P2P markets, LocalCryptos encrypts all your conversations end to end.\n\nEnd-to-end encryption (E2EE) is a communication system that allows only the communicating users to read the messages. E2EE prevents your Internet service providers, the law and even the owner of the service from accessing the decryption keys needed to read the conversation.\n\nTutanota is a well-known email service provider that supports E2EE within its own servers - as long as you are emailing with someone who is also using Tutanota, your emails are private. Not even Tutanota server administrators can access them.\n\nLocalCryptos implements E2EE which means you’re in control of your conversations. No one else can listen in, not even the owners of the platform themselves, nobody - with the unlikely exception of secret agents.\n\nLocalCryptos is a dApp\n\nAnd being a dApp, you can find it on dappradar in the section for exchanges. It is now drowned in the sea of DeFi swaps which also count as decentralized exchanges.\n\nAs of October 2022, LocalCryptos support 5 cryptocurrencies - Bitcoin and 4 dino alts: Ethereum, Litecoin, DASH and Bitcoin Cash.\n\nAll these cryptocurrencies support at least a rudimentary kind of smart contracts. Ethereum is obviously the most advanced of them, but Bitcoin scripts can code an on-chain version of a simple escrow too. Litecoin, DASH and Bitcoin Cash have similar capability.\n\nSo, here’s a practical application of a decentralized application: An exchange platform with automated decentralized escrow system.\n\nLocalCryptos do have a customer support in case of disputes. The help desk people have enough access to the escrow to release the money either to the vendor or to the buyer, but they cannot redirect the money to another address nor confiscate it. According to the platform, less than 1% of trades end up in a dispute.\n\nNew altcoins are probably not going to get listed any time soon, possibly after we see what survives after the looming thousand year bear market. Whenever new coins about to be listed, there is a public vote though, so you might want to follow LocalCryptos on Twitter.\n\nLocalCryptos is Non-Custodial\n\nThe platform was launched in the first wave of non-custodial exchanges, characteristically in the first alt season of 2017.\n\nThe non-custodial storage still applies and still runs in the same way as it did back then: You need to send your crypto into a dedicated address to participate in the smart contract setup of the dApp, but the exchange shows you the wallet seed.\n\nTo log into LocalCryptos, you can use a browser-based crypto wallet like MetaMask.\n\nHere’s a 2-minute walkthrough of making a trade by LocalCryptos team themselves:\n\n\n\nThe review: Are LocalCryptos legit?\n\nYes. They have good reputation since back when they were LocalEthereum. The company is incorporated in Australia under the same ABN since early 2018. The platform was initially launched in late 2017 as, let’s say, a startup run from a basement.\n\nThe LocalCryptos founder, Michael Foster, is a cryptocurrency OG since 2010 who has been particularly vocal about the use of cryptocurrency in countries with failed monetary systems. Here is the founder of LocalCryptos in late 2018 speculating that the currency failure in Venezuela could have been just the first domino piece.\n\nSign up at LocalCryptos\n\nLocalCryptos Fees\n\nOn LocalCryptos, all transactions are settled on-chain because it’s a peer-to-peer exchange. That means you will pay the additional transaction fee on top of anything the exchange charges. In ETH that might get pricy.\n\nThe escrow fees are 0.25% if you post an offer or 0.75% if you respond to one. That means that LocalCryptos take the total of 1% of every transaction on the platform.\n\nLocalCryptos Pros and Cons\n\nThere is one thing that all P2P marketplaces have in common: Vendors who trade on them sell crypto with prices over the market.\n\nBack in the heyday of LocalBitcoins, people didn’t have that much issue with that. Crypto exchanges were few, generally run by amateurs and vulnerable to hacks - MtGox was still in vivid memory. On top of that, your average crypto investor was “not in it for the money” and all that. People didn’t really mind paying a little extra for the convenience when Bitcoin traded at 100 bucks.\n\n\n  LocalCryptos is more expensive than exchanges\n\n\nThat brings me to a clear drawback of LocalCryptos: You will be able to purchase crypto much cheaper on any custodial exchange.\n\nLet’s look at a cost comparison.\n\nHere’s a good and very active LocalCryptos vendor with 99% positive review of about 1000 trades: Look for NZ_gwailou. This vendor services Hong Kong, Australia and New Zealand since 2017 and was last seen 11 hours prior.\n\nThis vendor sells ETH with the markup of 2.6% over market and BTC at 3.5% over market.\n\n\n\nIf you decide to buy Bitcoin from this vendor, you will be paying 3.5% markup, 0.75% escrow fee and any current bitcoin transaction fees.\n\nAt the time of writing, the average fee to send 500 USD worth of bitcoin is 1.11 USD and the current exchange rate at FTX is 21570 USD. Which gives the following:\n\n\n  \n    Buying 500 USD worth of BTC on FTX.com would cost you 0.1 USD in trading fees for limit order or 0.5 USD for instant market order and about 9 USD in withdrawal fees.\n\n    The total would be about 9.5 USD.\n  \n  \n    Since this is an Aussie and APAC vendor, let’s compare also with Independent Reserve. Buying 500 USD worth of BTC on there would cost 2.5 USD in trading fees (market or limit) and about 10 USD in withdrawal fees.\n\n    That’s a total of 12.5 USD.\n  \n  \n    Buying 500 USD worth of BTC via LocalCryptos would cost 21.25 USD in markup and escrow costs and 1.11 USD in transaction fees.\n\n    That is total of about 22.35 USD.\n  \n\n\nBottom line is that you probably won’t find yourself using LocalCryptos unless you really want to make your transactions without KYC, such as because you live in a non-US and non-EU location and most big crypto exchanges will not want to have you.\n\n\n  LocalCryptos is non-KYC, but have your ID ready\n\n\nSpeaking of which, you will probably need to provide your ID to your vendor.\n\nPeople want to see that your ID matches the name on the Paypal or whatever payment method you’re using. This is normal and encouraged on all P2P exchanges - LocalMonero even has it in their user guide as a recommended step.\n\nPeople will mostly compare LocalCryptos with LocalBitcoins, so let’s just make the difference crystal clear: On LocalBitcoins, you need to pass KYC site-wide, as in, the platform holds a copy of your documents. On LocalCryptos, this doesn’t happen and will never happen, because the platform is zero-knowledge.\n\nOn LocalCryptos you only ever get to send your ID scan to your vendor, but since your communication with them is end-to-end encrypted, that media file won’t get out, unless you’re doing business with undercover LE.\n\n\n  In some countries, you won’t find any active vendors at all\n\n\nThis goes hand in hand with the high fees and at this point, frankly, lack of demand for P2P exchanges in most countries: You need to shop around a lot before you land on a good P2P vendor.\n\nThe good thing is that LocalCryptos supports about 50 payment methods including wire transfers via Wise which are cheap around the globe, so you are not restricted to your country of origin. You will find a good vendor when you look hard enough, but I can’t imagine you’d do it unless you absolutely can’t use an exchange.\n\nSome of the top countries in terms of trading activity on LocalCryptos are Venezuela and Russia, which is not surprising. The first ever non-english Telegram channel that LocalCryptos launched was in Spanish to service all the customers in Venezuela.\n\nIf you browse through Venezuelan vendors’ offers, you will see it is not uncommon to see traders with 4-5 digits of transactions recorded. Argentina is similarly well taken care of, but in contrast to that there are only a handful of traders in Brazil and their average markup is at 25% over market. Rest of the region is apparently not aware of LocalCryptos at all.\n\nThere is a surprising amount of activity from Australia and New Zealand (or maybe not so surprising) and a fair amount of traders in Hong Kong. You will find a few high-reputation traders in the UK. Mainland Europe is largely unserviced on LocalCryptos. That makes sense, the only people there who want to use LocalCryptos are really just privacy enthusiasts.\n\nSo, as you see it can be a hit or miss.\n\nSign up at LocalCryptos\n\nBottom Line\n\nLocalCryptos is a decentralized, zero knowledge, non-custodial P2P marketplace for large cap cryptocurrencies. It is expensive and ridiculously time consuming and you won’t use it unless you need it. But for those who do need it, it is there, reliable, with great track record and solid backend system.\n",

If your trade is speculative, you also don’t have to worry about timing the market - perpetual futures never expire. You can carry on holding the contract as long as you want.

In those times the volumes decline and not much is happening on the markets. On altcoin markets, where thin order books are normal, you can still see Barts quite often.\n\nConsidering this kind of market environment, what does the Bart pattern mean?\n\nThe idea behind the Bart pattern is that there was an attempt to start a run-up in the market. It could have been done by a single actor or by means of organic uncoordinated speculation, that doesn’t really matter.\n\nThe important information is that this attempt did not catch on. Bart is a signal of relative weakness on the market: The speculation is trying to get ahead of the market.\n\nAlternative name for Bart Simpson formation is Pump and Dump.\n\nThe Inverse Bart formation\n\nSometimes referred to as “traB”.

Only if your risk tolerance is high.\n\nRemember that Bart is a failed attempt at starting a run-up. There was some follow through, but not enough yet. The market needs to build up the momentum a little longer, and in the meantime a fundamental event can happen that changes everything … In other words, there is no way to time the market from the presence of Bart patterns alone.\n\nHowever, it does show some early confidence on the market.\n\nSo, those are the options:\n\n\n  If the market is failing to establish bottom, it is too early to be bullish. You may have better odds in short-term short positions, but you need to consider other technical analysis, such as support and resistance lines.\n  It is a super bad time to speculate with futures or any other time-limited contracts. With plain leverage though, the story is different. You could use contracts like the Bitmex perpetual swap to try and catch longing the next Bart. Shorting it is more risky if the overall structure of the market looks like slowly setting up for a run-up.\n  If there is a Bart on the hourly charts but you are normally looking at the D and W charts and your opinion there is bullish, you could buy spot for the mid- to long-term.\n\n",

      content: "Segregated Witness is a network feature activated on the Bitcoin and Litecoin blockchains.\n\n\n  If you want to switch to SegWit addresses, you need either the Electrum wallet or one of the Ledger wallets\n  You may be looking for: LTC address converter, BTC address converter\n\n\n\n\nWhat does Segregated Witness mean?\n\nSegWit segregates part of the data out of the transaction. It is specifically part of the transaction signature data that gets removed. As a result, the transaction is smaller in terms of bytes, and requires less network fee.\n\nIn general, segwit transactions are cheaper, and on top of that they allow certain advanced scripting. Second layer scaling solutions such as Lightning Network are among these advanced capabilities.\n\n\n  If you want to switch to SegWit addresses, you need either the Electrum wallet or one of the Ledger wallets.\n\n\nShould you use Segwit or Legacy?\n\nUltimately, it is up to you. Segwit and legacy addresses are mutually compatible.\n\nBitcoin network:\n\n\n  Bitcoin Legacy (P2PKH, or “pay to public key hash”): address starting with 1\n  Bitcoin Nested SegWit (P2SH, or “pay to script hash”): address starting with 3\n  Bitcoin Native SegWit (bech32, or “base32 encoded with error detection”): address start with bc1\n\n\nLitecoin network:\n\n\n  Litecoin Legacy (P2PKH, or “pay to public key hash”): address starting with L\n  Litecoin Nested SegWit (P2SH, or “pay to script hash”): address starting with M or more rarely with 3\n\n\nIf you support second layer scaling and scripting solutions on the Bitcoin and Litecoin network, use SegWit. If you like the idea of slightly cheaper transactions, use SegWit. If you don’t really care, keep using legacy, unless you really have to.\n\nWhere to use bitcoin P2SH wallet\n\n\n  apps that use automated escrow, like localcryptos (you have no other choice there)\n  crypto trading platforms where you withdraw money often\n  crypto exchanges where you are not verified and might be required to sign a message with your address (signing is problematic with native segwit)\n\n\nTry LocalCryptos!\n\nWhere to use bitcoin bech32 wallet\n\n\n  crypto trading platforms where you withdraw money often\n  crypto exchanges where you are fully verified (KYC/AML)\n\n\nWhere to use bitcoin legacy wallet (P2PKH)\n\n\n  crypto exchanges where you are not verified and might be required to sign a message with your address (signing is problematic with native segwit)\n\n\nFrom your private key, you can generate either address format\n\nIf you own a private key, you can choose to use Segwit or Legacy addresses with it - or both. Your wallet seed can be used to generate either address format.\n\nThe address format matters because…\n\n\n  … not all features you might want to use are available with all formats.\n  … your wallet might only support one address type at a time. Electrum wallet does this, and for you it means that if you choose to restore a seed into a SegWit wallet, your Legacy balance will not show.\n  … some exchanges will only let you send coins to a legacy wallet.\n\n\nFor a full list on which wallets support which address format, head over to our post about altcoin wallets.\n\nWhy do some wallets say a SegWit address is invalid?\n\nSegwit and legacy addresses are mutually compatible. You can transfer your coin from a legacy address into a segwit address and the other way round.\n\nThat however does not mean that all wallets will let you make a transaction to any address.\n\nSome wallets did not implement SegWit address generation yet, because it is quite a new technology and they worry about possible bugs. For instance the bloxkchain.com wallet does not support other than legacy addresses. That means they will not let you send or receive your coins from or to a segwit address.\n\nSome wallets, and still some exchanges, will not let you withdraw coins to anything other than legacy address. This is done to minimize possible errors on part of users.\n\nDecentralized exchanges and non-custodial trading platforms like LocalCryptos will only let you withdraw coins to SegWit addresses, because they need the scripting functionality that are enabled by SegWit.\n\n\n  You may be looking for the LTC address converter or the BTC address converter\n\n",

They work well on markets that trade in pairs, such as currencies.\n\nThe reason for this fit is the fact that bbands are in fact a moving average with two standard deviations on either side.\n\nWhich means the information bbands are giving you when the price action ventures out of them is basically: “this ratio shot up a bit more then usuall - it might shoot back some time soon, but then it also might not”.\n\nAnd so, now you can hopefully stop treating John Bollinger like a demi-god.\n\nHigh-probability chart patterns with Bollinger bands\n\n\n  Double bottom, taken relatively to the bottom bband (price is about the same distance from the bottom band at both lows, in actual value terms it can be different)\n  Higher low, taken relatively to the bottom bband (price is lower on the second low, but is closer to the middle band than on the first low)\n  BBand squeeze (the bandwidth strategy: the distance between the top and the bottom Bollinger band is decreasing, which means volatility is low, which means at some point the volatility might get high again - duh)\n  Three pushes to a high (a topping pattern that relies on traders to be greedy in a market that is not as strong as it has been for a while until then - this buying-up results in a triple top where the consecutive tops get droopy, volume lowers and price wanders longer distance from the top Bollinger band)\n\n",

Over time online payment methods were added and you could buy and sell crypto with verified or unverified digital wallets like Skrill, or you could do bank transfers.\n\nThe platform had an escrow where the crypto vendor had to mark the transaction as successful for the bitcoins to be released to the buyer. The escrow was the feature that kept people trading through LBC despite the fees and the clunky interface, although people with a trusted regular vendor often moved on and transacted privately without escrow (and therefore without LBC fees).\n\nID verification (KYC/AML) was originally not required by LocalBitcoins; it was sometimes required by vendors though.\n\nLocalBitcoins started requiring KYC in 2018\n\nLBC was the most popular p2p platform for many years, even for some time after criminals trying to cash out five figures of bitcoins through one LBC meeting started getting in jail.\n\nThe main weakness is that while LocalBitcoins are a p2p (peer-to-peer) marketplace, they are custodial - you need to send your bitcoin into the LBC wallet to make it available for the escrow.\n\nThis was the point upon which LocalBitcoins were eventually forced to require KYC platform-wide in 2018.\n\nBy then it was already rumored they tightly collaborate with law enforcement and since there were other options with less hassle and better privacy in 2018, people simply left LBC abandoned.\n\nWhere to buy bitcoin and altcoins anonymously in 2020\n\nPlatform called LocalCryptos is where P2P trading is at in 2020.

The LocalCryptos platform is a dApp running on Ethereum smart contracts and on Bitcoin scripts.\n\nYou get your private key on sign up, which you must back up because the marketplace is fully zero-knowledge and fully non-custodial.\n\nThis means you lose your account and all coins it has if you lose your private key, but it also means the law enforcement cannot force any platform-wide action since the platform owns no data.\n\nThe founder of LocalCryptos has strong political opinions and is not shy to share them.\n\n\n\n",

Among people who are not used to that, the pressure can become over the top and wreck the judgement of the unprepared ones.\n\nThis makes it worthwhile to work on your trading psychology, even if you are not a trader but rather a Long-Term Holder or are just doing Dollar Cost Average: Becoming more mentally tough will make it harder for you to sell the bottom of the next market correction.\n\nRecommended Books to Improve Your Trading Psychology\n\n\n  Jared Tendler — The Mental Game of Poker\n\n\nDifferent industry, but applies very well to crypto trading.\n\nOne of the key lessons of Tendler’s book is called unconscious competence: You can learn a new skill well, but until it is settled in your mind so well that you aren’t even aware that you were not born with it, then you will not remember to use it in the critical moment when you are under pressure.\n\n\n  Daniel Kahneman — Thinking Fast and Slow\n\n\nThis is a famous one.\n\nYou will learn an awful lot about cognitive biases, quick judgements and all kind of stuff that you would probably want to avoid knowing about because it will make you feel quite dumb.\n\n\n  Michael Mauboussin — More Than You Know\n\n\nThis is another one that became a popular read among poker players.\n\nIt goes through a lot of interesting ideas on what influences your trading and definitely influences the trading of a substantial portion of the crowd.\n\nTake for instance emotions:\n\nMost people will tell you to disregard your emotions when you trade. Sadly, research shows that it’s impossible.\n\nWhat you can do instead is to accept that your emotions will trigger during abrupt price action. Then you can try to anticipate how they could influence your trading in different situations.\n\nWith this worked out, you can then do your best to not act on the emotion when it triggers and instead capitalize on the rest of the crowd where the majority will be acting on the same emotion.\n\nTrading Psychology vs Market Psychology\n\nTrading psychology and market psychology are two different, but related terms.\n\nRead the ATNET Glossary on Market Psychology.\n\nAs a trader, your individual mindset and decision making process contributed to the existence of the market and in one way or another becomes an influence of the market psychology.\n\n\n  You may be in agreement with the prevailing market tendency, act on it and make this tendency even stronger.\n  You may be in disagreement with the aggregate market tendency, act on it and in this way create the opposite side of the book that is required for the market to exist.\n\n",

      content: "What is Yield Farming: In DeFi context, Yield Farming is a term for earning passive income on your cryptocurrency by locking it up into a DeFi (decentralized finance) contract.\n\n\n\nHow Yield Farming works\n\nYield farming is done automatically via a smart contract. Other than that, the principle is similar to earning interest on from a traditional bank in exchange to locking up your savings for a certain period of time.\n\nIn 2020 DeFi is still in its infancy and most yield farming is done by ERC20 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, but that may change in the future.\n\nYield farming vs Staking\n\nYield farming is not staking.\n\nAs a staker, you provide your cryptocurrency to the Proof of Stake algorithm which is used to confirm network transactions. By staking, you help keep the network running.\n\nAs a yield farmer, you are purely a network user. The DeFi contract through which you do yield farming is just another contract built on top of a blockchain.\n\nIn yield farming, you need provide your token to a liquidity pool that powers a decentralized exchange, a marketplace or a lending app. Your token can be used in a number of activities, as simple as lending but possibly also much more complex.\n\nThe activity is usually something that generates a fee (like again crypto lending for instance) which will then go to you as part of your yield.\n\nExamples of popular Yield Farming DeFi projects are Compound, Synthetix or Uniswap.\n\nYield farming market metrics\n\nThe total locked value shows the total liquidity locked up in a DeFi contract. That measures its health and also the market share of that project.\n\nAnother sign of strength and reliability of a DeFi project can be the listing of its token on the most popular crypto exchanges.\n\nTransparency of the project team can be used as a sort of metric too, DeFi is an unregulated field and scams are abundant.\n\nRisks of Yield Farming\n\nYield Farming is not a free lunch; your profit may be passive but it is not risk-free.\n\nYield Farming makes use of decentralized applications that are operated by smart contracts. The whole point of this set up is for it to be trustless, but the reality is that unless you are able to audit a smart contract on your own, you still need to trust someone’s claim that it’s safe.\n\nYour main risks are bugs in the smart contract, fraud, exit scams or hack.\n",

SegWit is the newer format, it has some advanced capabilities and slightly lower fees.\n\nIf you don’t care and just want to be on the safe side without complicating things, choose legacy.\n\n\n  Legacy Bitcoin addresses start with 1. These are recognised as valid at all exchanges except LocalCryptos which is a dApp and needs the advanced features of SegWit to automate the escrow process.\n  SegWit Bitcoin addresses start with 3 (called P2SH) or bc1 (called bech32). The bc1 version is the latest one, but not yet accepted everywhere.\n\n\nIf you want to, you can make a legacy wallet and then create another Electrum wallet with the same seed, but choose SegWit. This will give you two wallets with different sets of addresses, but all under the same seed.\n\nOn Ledger Nano Wallets, you can do the same thing by creating a new subaccount in Ledger Live.\n\nElectrum to store altcoins (Monero, ETH, ZEC)\n\nElectrum is a bitcoin-only wallet.\n\nThe real Electrum wallet does not support any altcoins.\n\nElectrum Forks for Altcoins\n\nBack in the infancy of alternative cryptocurrencies, altcoins like monero had for a short time relatively similar codebase to that of bitcoin. Then it used to be possible to store monero in Electrum, in Trezor with a bit of hacking, and in any other bitcoin wallet.\n\nThose times are LONG gone; it is no longer possible to store in Electrum any cryptocurrencies that are not bitcoin.\n\n\n  Do not send monero to Electrum\n  Do not send ethereum to Electrum\n  Do not send zcash to Electrum\n\n\nElectrum forks\n\nBecause Electrum has been such a successful bitcoin wallet, with bitcoin forks and with some altcoins the developers opted to release their own wallets based on the original Electrum code.\n\nThose wallets are a different software authored by developers other than Thomas Voegtlin.\n\nElectrum forks for altcoins are NOT available from electrum.org and may not be safe to use.\n\nStaking on Electrum forks\n\nElectrum and its forks are basic wallets designed for holding, message signatures and transaction batching. Staking on an Electrum fork is not possible.\n\nIf you’re looking for a staking wallet, read our staking wallets and services guide.\n\nElectrum security issues\n\nAt the time of writing the latest Electrum release is Electrum-4.0.4 (Nov 2020) and there are no known vulnerabilities in it.\n\nThere have been two major security issues with older versions of the Electrum wallet. Both were exploited and fixed in 2018.\n\n\n  Electrum versions older than 3.3.4 are susceptible to a phishing attack, where the attacker tricks you into downloading a fake Electrum update and steals your private keys.\n  Electrum versions older than 3.0.5 have a serious vulnerability where your private keys may get exposed if your currently open wallet does not have a passphrase set and you’re online with browser open.\n\n\nAs a precaution, it is recommended to\n\n\n  always download Electrum from electrum.org\n  verify the PGP signature provided by the developer (it is the same one since 2013)\n\n\nHow to verify a PGP signature\n\nElectrum Advanced Features\n\n\n  Coin Control: Deciding which incoming transaction you want to spend. This is useful for dust attacks\n  Bitcoin Signatures: Electrum lets you sign a message with your private keys. A valid signature is a proof of ownership of that private key. This verification is typically needed when you lose access to an exchange account where you were not verified.\n  Sweeping: Private key sweeping, which is useful for redeeming forks and airdrops.\n  Watch-Only: Creating watch-only wallets.

Also, since it is a derivative contract, you can trade it with up to 20x leverage without paying any interest.\n\nOn the contrary, you have to pay interest if you want to use leverage on spot markets. (With perps it is more complicated, you either pay interest or collect it.)\n\nAll in all, for speculative positions, quarterlies still offer a cheap way to scale into a leveraged directional position and hold it for several weeks or months.\n\nWhere to trade quarterlies in 2020\n\nQuarterlies are a staple derivative product that can be traded on most crypto derivative trading platforms.\n\nUntil 2017-2018 the hotspot for bitcoin futures specifically was a Chinese trading platform OKCoin. Quarterlies were the most popular derivative there.

Anyone’s money could be frozen or retrieved by an authority etc - the control is simply better than with fiat money.\n  CBDCs are not a threat to international stability as long as people would need to be authorised to be able to pay with a foreign currency. This would eradicate for instance the USD cash black markets we see in some Latin American countries.\n\n\nFull reports with comments are available on Reddit.\n\nLimitations of CBDCs\n\nToo Much Transparency\n\nThe community has not put too much credit to the CBDC initiatives. The consensus seems to be that as with many DeFi projects, the blockchain-based solution would bring in too much transparency.\n\nIn other words, there is the idea institutions like central banks or even commercial banks and insurance companies benefit from private data silos and from the fact that their workflows are not public.\n\nQE\n\nThere is also the argument that it does not seem possible to do fractional banking, quantitative easing and other currently employed monetary policies in DeFi.\n\nThis is in fact not true, as was shown in a Deribit Insights article on stablecoins:\n\n\n  A central bank currency can be treated as a stablecoin because it would be pegged to certain value (ie to such value that would allow citizens of a country to keep buying a stable basket of goods)\n  No stablecoin has this architecture properly in place, but there are ways to regulate the value peg by changing interest rates. For instance, this type of peg regulation is in place on the BitMEX perpetual swap market\n  Finally, open market operations equivalent to QE are possible in DeFi. In an open market operation, some amount of the currency would be initially minted without backing. This currency would be used to buy up assets like ETH on the open market. These newly bought assets would then back the currency and the system would remain solvent. At the same time, the supply of the currency in the system increases, hopefully creating pressure on the price.\n\n\nThis idea does not address why anyone would trade ETH for an asset that is not backed by anything, but sadly it is safe to assume that claiming “It’s backed by the word of the government” would probably fly well enough.\n\nMore in DeFi Glossary\n\n\n  How does yield farming work?\n  What is total locked value?\n\n\nWhere to trade DeFi tokens\n\n\n  When ETH gas is cheap, use the non-custodial platform Uniswap.\n  For other times, make an account on WhiteBit.

That is why Coinbase exchange will want you to KYC buy Coinbase wallet has no good reason to.\n\nAirdrops requiring KYC are in most cases borderline scam. At best, it’s simply not worth it to give away your identity to collect couple dollar’s worth of useless token.\n\nA cryptocurrency wallet is just a device to generate private keys for you.

Do not KYC to get a cryptocurrency wallet.\n\nFree and anonymous cryptocurrency wallets include:\n\n\n  Electrum\n  Jaxx, Exodus\n  Ledger Wallet, if you pay in crypto and are carefull about the delivery place\n\n\nStaking and KYC\n\nStaking wallets as well as generally crypto exchanges that support staking do not require KYC.\n\nDedicated staking providers, masternode hosting providers and staking pools likewise do not require KYC.\n\nStaking is one part of the crypto economy that is unregulated for now, just like trading used to be. Until the global legal systems catch up with that, the same reasoning as with wallets apply here: If someone requires KYC to let you stake, and it is not a top-tier well known business like Kraken Exchange, then it is a scam.\n\nRecommended Crypto Trading Platforms without KYC\n\n\n  (Custodial) Bitfinex: spot, margin, lending, futures, airdrops\n  (Custodial) ByBit: futures, airdrops has limits, is shady\n  (Custodial) WhiteBit: futures, airdrops has limits\n  (Non-Custodial) LocalCryptos: onramp\n  (Non-Custodial) Uniswap: spot\n  (Non-Custodial) LeverJ: futures\n\n",

ALMA is a charting tool popular among stock and crypto traders.\n\nALMA is a moving average that reduces the noise of small price fluctuations by averaging the price from both directions - from past to present and the other way too.\n\nIn mathematical terms, it uses the shape of a normalized distribution (kind of like the bell curve).\n\nWhat that does in practice is it lessens the time lag that all moving averages have, due to being averaged over lengthy time periods.\n\n\n\nHow to trade ALMA\n\n\n  \n    Use it as the faster MA. The ALMA indicator lags less, which means it can be used as the faster MA for your crossovers. This is a strategy that can be easily automated and with proper settings will give better results than using plain moving averages.\n  \n  \n    As a confirmation of oscillators. The ALMA can also confirm overbought or oversold conditions signalled by oscillators like StochRSI or Inverse Fisher RSI. As the ALMA always sticks close to the price, you can confirm your levels just by seeing if it’s above the price or below. In an overbought market with ALMA over the price, you’ve got a sell signal.\n  \n  \n    Use it for scalping. I pity anyone who wants to do this manually but in sideways markets you can scalp the crossovers of ALMA with price.\n  \n\n\nBest Tools for TA Trading in Crypto\n\n\n  Trading Platform: Bitfinex\n  Charting Tool: Tradingview\n  Trading Bot: Shrimpy\n\n\nRead our list of tools for crypto traders for more free and freemium options.\n",

This surge in bullish momentum is what painted the candle nr. 2 bigger than candle nr. 1.\n\nBearish engulfing\n\nBearish engulfing means that on your timeframe, there has been a change in momentum - bearish reversal. This surge in bearish momentum is what painted the candle nr. 2 bigger than candle nr. 1.\n\nEngulfings are a well performing pattern on cryptocurrency markets, due to the higher volatility there. In crypto, momentum often changes quickly, especially on smaller altcoin markets.\n\nStatistically speaking, engulfing performs well in general. With both bullish and bearish engulfing, you get over 50% success by trading on engulfing only. The issue with engulfing is that this two-candle pattern says nothing about whether the reversal has any chance to catch on. It absolutely can get rejected very soon!\n\nSo, if you are a scalper, engulfing might be good enough to trade on. Engulfing is also a good candidate for TA-based bot trading automation.\n\nFor those who are not super keen on daytrading or other short term trading techniques, it is best to consider not only engulfing but also other technical indicators. Check divergences, momentum, volume profile. This way you’ll get clue if the reversal is serious or just a short-lived nonevent.\n\n\n  More on divergences\n  More on volume profile trading\n  More on BBands\n\n\nWhere to get engulfing alerts\n\nTradingView has a bunch of public scripts that highlight engulfing candles for you.

This term is not specific to crypto.\n\nMarket traders call arbitrage a non-directional trading strategy that makes profit from different pricing of the same asset on different markets.\n\nHow to do basic crypto arbitrage?\n\nAs the simplest example of arb, the actual exchange-to-p2p arbitrage workflow includes having two accounts at different exchanges.\n\nThe two exchanges must have a price discrepancy. The “expensive” one might be a p2p marketplace like LocalCryptos and the cheap one a trading platform like Binance.\n\nYou need a stash of crypto on an (expensive) exchange ready to sell and a stash of fiat on the (cheap) exchange ready to buy.\n\n\n  Find two crypto exchanges where cryptocurrency trades at different prices\n  Buy crypto at the cheaper one\n  Sell the crypto at the expensive one\n  Withdraw your base currency\n\n\nThis workflow can be automated using Shrimpy or Coinrule zero-code platforms.\n\nIs arbitrage profitable?\n\nThe very early days of crypto trading were good for arbitrage even on bitcoin markets, because the liquidity was lower and markets were not as efficient. Since maybe 2018, it mostly does not pay to execute arbitrage trades manually. It is a low-risk low-profit game of numbers: If you can do it with 6 figures USD through a bot, it is still worth it. Other than that, not so much.\n\nOne notable exception to the rule are people with dual citizenship or some other legal rarity that gives them full access into two mutually disconnected markets.\n\nTypically that would mean having a fully verified account on a “western” trading platform, complete with a local bank connection, and the same set up in a country like South Korea, India or Brazil.\n\nMoving fiat money to and from these countries is not easy, the arbitrage opportunity is therefore stable.\n\nArbitrage as P2P reselling\n\nOn p2p marketplaces like LocalCryptos, cryptocurrencies trade 2-10% over market. Buying on an exchange like Bitstamp and selling P2P is a stable arbitrage opportunity.\n\nIs arbitrage risk-free?\n\nNo.\n\nArbitrage is a non-directional trade, but your money may get stuck at any point on its way and get you exposed to market volatility.\n\nBest Tools for Arb (Arbing, Arbitrage)\n\n\n  Trading Platform: Independent Reserve, LocalCryptos\n  Technical Analysis: Basic market phase analysis to avoid trading at fragile times.\n  Automation: Coinrule\n\n",

This term is not specific to crypto.\n\nMarket traders call DCB the short-lived recovery that comes after the first bottom in a new downtrend.\n\n\n\nWhat is a valid DCB?\n\nDCB is the first bottom after a downturn on the market. Typically, the market will bottom out in two bottoms, sometimes forming a W-pattern.\n\nThe dead cat bounce can occur on any timeframe.\n\nIt is still a DCB no matter whether the reversal of the direction is only temporary (such as with a retracement) or if the asset continues to makes new lows and goes into a bear market.\n\n\n\nHow to trade a DCB?\n\nThere are several strategies to trade the dead cat bounce. To choose one, consider your risk appetite, your timeframe preference and your long-term position.\n\n\n  Do you want to do a speculative trade? What’s the expected upside, what’s the expected downside?\n  Is this speculation, like scalping, or do you want to protect yourself in case this is the top?\n  In the long run, are you bullish or bearish on the asset?\n\n\nTrading DCB as a speculation\n\nScalpers and short term traders will watch the 1-5 minute timeframe for turns in volume, hitting a support and sometimes Fib levels.\n\nLonging the first bottom\n\nOn first bullish signal, open a leveraged long. Then close it for small profit once the bounce from the bottom starts to slow down.\n\n\n  Tensorcharts can be very useful for this.\n\n\nShorting the market retrace\n\nOn the market topping out and starting the market retrace, open a short. Set up either a trailing stop or a regular stop at the top and move the stop down as the price falls.\n\nOn good volume, a good place for the stop is the middle of the previous candle.\n\nOn thinner and volatile markets with stop hunts, the top of the previous candle is better.\n\nFor a fully automated TA-based trading, try the Coinrule bot. The interface is user friendly, no need to write code to create or even backtest your automated trading strategy.\n\nMarket Retracement: Trading DCB in case it could be “the top”\n\nIf the price retraces from a top, nobody can be certain whether it’s a local top or the end of the bull market. There are always signs, but then again - sometimes honeybadger doesn’t care and the bull market extends further in spite of those signs.\n\nThere is a technique of trading the market retracement that can protect you in case the price falls more and for longer.\n\nThis technique is less for profit and more for hedge.\n\n\n  Open a short once you notice the price topping out. BBands patterns help there.\n  Set your stop to previous high once the price moves down.\n  Wait for the DCB, the rise from it and the top of the first bounce.\n  Once the price moves down for there, set your stop to the top of the first bounce.\n\n\nIn case the market makes new highs, your stop will trigger and you’ll be back in.

Automating value averaging needs a bit more settings than automating DCA, but you will be able to run an automation like even in the free version of Coinrule.\n\nThis is how to value average, manually or through automation:\n\n\n  Choose your target percentage. Maybe you are not comfortable with more than 30% of your crypto asset’s value in ETH, maybe you are not comfortable with more than 20% of your net worth in crypto. There is no rule for these numbers, it all depends on your perception of risk and your preferences.\n  Choose your time interval for rebalancing. Sensible choices could be once a month, once a quarter or once a year.\n  Once in each time interval, retrieve your asset’s value.\n  Calculate the percentage of your portfolio or of your total net worth the asset makes at its current price.\n  Buy or sell to get your target percentage.\n\n\nValue average pricing in what?\n\nIt is worth mentioning you do not need to work with the USD value of your assets.\n\nIf they are altcoins, it might be better to take the BTC value instead. If you only hold BTC but want to sell off as its price increases, you might want to consider its value in gold.\n\n\n\nValue averaging as risk management\n\nValue averaging is a less bullish position than DCA, or dollar cost averaging.

      content: "Market profile is a method of market structure analysis developed (and registered) by J. Peter Steidlmayer. It is most used on legacy markets where there are various charting software packages available.\n\nTo learn about what market profile is and how it was developed, get the Steidlmayer’s book “Steidlmayer on markets”.\n\n\n\nWhat is Market Profile\n\nMarket profile is a technical analysis method that statistically splits a trading day’s activity by price of executed trades.\n\n3 most important data points market profile provides:\n\n\n  the current range boundaries (support and resistance): At which prices are people suddenly not willing to buy or sell anymore, forcing the market to retrace back?\n  the phase of the market:\n    \n      Is it a “responsive” market, with the tendency to always return to a mean price, like in sideways markets?\n      Is it an “initiative” market, where a small trend picks up and does not tend to return to its past means, like in trending markets?\n    \n  \n  the point of control: Market profile identifies the “value”, or the point of control (POC), as the price level that generated the highest traded volume of the day. This is where the market perceives the price as fair that day.\n\n\nA perfect market would paint its market profile as a perfect bell curve statistical split. On real markets the curve will be skewed but still similar.\n\nThe bell curve is formed by “time-price opportunities”, TPOs, which are boxes or letters stacked on each other. Each box marks a representative price that was traded during a timespan. For technical analysis on the 1D scale, each block usually represents a 30 minute timespan.\n\nMarket profile also shows where the market opened, that’s the blue line on the left.\n\nThe most basic information you can get is the market phase: If the market opened at a different price than where was yesterday’s fair value, how did the traders react? Did the market return to the previous mean and formed a high volume area there, or did it generate high volume at a new price level?\n\nThis is an illustration from Sierra Chart software:\n\n\n\nWhere to get Market Profile for crypto?\n\nThere is a free TradingView script based on Steidlmayer’s market profile. It is called simply “Market Profile”, published to Tradingview in 2020 by LonesomeTheBlue.\n\nIn a sense, you also get similar information from split candles in footprint charts of tensor charts. These are less intuitive charting tools but offer very detailed information.\n\nTry TensorCharts FREE\n\nDoes Market Profile work in crypto?\n\nSteidlmayer first started developing market profile in the 50s. He had to completely change his trading strategy in the 60s and onwards, when funds came to existence. This changed the structure of the market as until the 50s the market was pretty much all retail.\n\nWhen all participants have similar amount of money, technical trading works better. Once there are players with outsized stacks, the main rule becomes “market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent”.\n\nMarket profile as a tool for technical analysis works on any market. Below is a 2013 recording of Steidlmayer’s lecture on market profile and how to adapt it to modern markets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe same YouTuber, DayTraderPro, has more recordings with Steidlmayer’s lectures if you’re interested.\n\nBest Tools for Market Profile\n\n\n  Trading Platform: Bitfinex\n  TA Automation: Coinrule\n  Charting App: TensorCharts\n\n",

      content: "In trading, risk-reward ratios (RRR) are used to determine how much you’re risking in relation to the amount you potentially stand to gain.\n\n\n\nTraders work with risk-reward rations every time they set a stop loss.\n\nCharting tools like TradingView make it possible to mark your RRR on their charts when you’re planning or sharing your trades.\n\nThis is what a risk-reward ratio long trade looks like on TradingView:\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\nCommon risk-reward ratios\n\nThe 1:x risk-reward format\n\nUsing the most intuitive format, a trader may be willing to take on a trade with a 1:3 risk-reward ratio, which means that for every $1 they stand to lose, they could potentially make $3.\n\nIn a 1:2 RRR, you are risking 1 dollar to every 2 you might gain.\n\nBoth these are considered a long-term profitable risk-reward ratio, as the potential reward is greater than the potential loss.\n\nConversely, a trader may be willing to take on a trade with a 1:1 risk-reward ratio, which means that for every $1 they stand to lose, they could potentially make $1.\n\nThis is considered an unfavorable risk-reward ratio, as the potential loss is greater than the potential gain.\n\nTradingView RRR format\n\nTradingview reports your risk-reward ratio in the simplified format - only giving the reward part. It is the convention to always have the risk part as 1, which means you might as well leave it out and traders will still understand.\n\nSo, a risk-reward ratio given as 3 is the same as 1:3\n\n\n\nIn the screenshot above you see a risk-reward ratio of 2.45, or 1:2.45, for a long on BTCUSD.\n\n\n  You are placing your stop loss to risk a 3.33% loss for a chance at your target 8.16% profit.\n  8.16% profit from open is a 3142 USD difference. 1283, or 3.33%, makes the price difference from open to stop loss.\n  Dividing 8.16/3.33 gives 2.45.\n  Dividing 3142/1283 also gives 2.45.\n\n\nThe RRR of 2.45 is a “favourable” risk-reward setup because it puts less money at risk than it projects to gain.\n\nStop-hunting in crypto markets\n\nThe reality is (sadly) not that simple.\n\nA 2.45 risk-reward ratio on the super volatile crypto markets will results in your trades getting stopped out more often. There is a thing that is sometimes referred to as “stop hunting” where large traders are able to temporarily move the market just enough to trigger everyone’s stops.\n\nSo at the end of the day, if you get stopped out of your otherwise well-judged speculations, then that stop loss is not that favourable at all.\n\nIf you trade manually and babysit your trades, in volatile markets it may be a good idea to set a loose stop loss at first. Then watch the price action and move your stop into profit as soon as you can.\n\nAutomated trading\n\nOn the other hand, risk-reward ratios are priceless in bot trading - in crypto or elsewhere.\n\nIn automated trading, you are not present to babysit your position. Also, usually your trading bot is programmed to make many small trades a day - more than you would manually.\n\nThis makes bot trading a numbers game. You need to have a defined risk to stay profitable in the long run. So, there is not much of a successful bot trading without considering risk-reward ratios.\n\nPortfolio-wide Risk Management\n\nLast but not least, if you hold multiple cryptos, you might be interested in portfolio-wide risk-reward setups. It’s the exact same thing as what you do on a single market, except you define how much base value you are willing to lose in a drawdown on your total portfolio.\n\nIt is possible to automate your portfolio management with tools like Shrimpy, which offers a portfolio-wide stop loss.\n",

If everyone started trading on it, it would bite into the exchange’s technical performance.\n\nThat’s why is not possible to trade on VPVR directly on your exchange, even if the exchange uses TradingView charts.\n\nBut since Cryptowatch provides VPVR and you can trade directly from Cryptowatch, trading through Cryptowatch is a workaround for trading directly.\n\nCryptowatch will let you trade on VPVR at Binance, Kraken, FTX, Bitfinex or Coinbase.\n\nVPVR Binance trading Setup\n\nHere’s how to set up your VPVR trading on Binance through Cryptowatch, but the steps are really the same for FTX, Kraken or Bitfinex too:\n\n\n  In your Binance account, generate API keys with trading enabled\n  On Cryptowatch, go to your account settings\n  Go to exchange keys\n  Find Binance and insert the API keys you generated\n  Trade on Binance via Cryptowatch - here’s how to load the VPVR indicator into your cryptowatch charts)\n  Profit\n\n\n\n\nHow to get VPVR for free on Tradingview (volume profile visible range &amp; fixed range)\n\nVPVR is marketed as a PRO tool. It is not that volume trading is more difficult than other trading styles, it is just that volume profiles need granular market data - loads of it. If you want granular data like VPVR, your charting platform will want you to pay for it. Compare VPVR with the basic volume TA tools like OBV.\n\nThey are all averaged-out, statistical data - the opposite of VPVR.\n\nHowever, the TradingView public library always delivers…somewhat.\n\nFree VPVR alternative on TradingView\n\nThere is one good free volume profile indicator on TradingView that is close to the real VPVR. It paints the volume histogram over last 100 candles of your chart and highlights the top volume areas.\n\nThis is hands down the best free volume profile indicator as of now.\n\n\n  You’ll find it in TradingView library under “Poor Man’s Volume Profile”\n\n\nI have tested a couple more free volume profile indicators from TradingView. Read this ScriptSpotlight if you are interested. If you just want to try VPVR trading on a charting platform you already use, then just go for “Poor Man’s Volume Profile”.\n\nIf nothing else, it is certainly good enough to find out if you like working with VPVR or not.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrading the VPVR Indicator? (Basics)\n\n\n\nThis is what VPVR looks like.\n\nReading VPVR boils down to two things:\n\n  Finding the gaps. If price didn’t stay somewhere for very long, than that area might have been covered in an irrational speculative run.\n  Finding the price with the highest traded volume. This brings you close to identifying areas of supply and demand, and therefore your support and resistance.\n\n\nBe careful, though: VPVR lets you roll back through the market history. Depending on where you stop, you might get a very misleading picture. In a recent ScriptSpotlight on volume trading this is explained with screenshots.\n\n\n\n\n  Go on here for fully explained setups and strategies for VPVR trading\n\n\nTips for trading on volume profile ranges\n\n\n  Give VPVR time to load. It really uses loads of data, it might take a minute to show up.\n  Volume profile fixed range is both easier to find for free and easier to use.\n  Daily volume profiles are the easiest to interpret (if your standard timeframe is 4H or less)\n\n\nIndicators to use together with VPVR\n\nVolume profile is often used as a complement to other methods of technical analysis.\n\n\n  Ichimoku cloud\n  Bollinger bands strategies\n  Order flow and heatmaps\n  Wyckoff method - plotting volume on the side can help you identify market ranges\n\n\nTools for VPVR Trading in Crypto\n\n\n  Trading Journal: A plain Excel spreadsheet, or CoinMarketMan\n  Charting Tool: Tradingview\n  Trading Interface: Cryptowatch\n  Trading Bot: Coinrule\n  Go to list of tools for crypto traders for more\n\n",

      title: "Web3",
      content: "Almost everyone has heard the buzzword: Web3, or sometimes Web 3.0. What does that mean, why do blockchain people talk about Web3 and how is Web3 different from Web2?\n\nWeb3 is still in its early stages\n\n\n  Web 1.0 is the web as a book to read. There is not much way to publicly interact with others. The invention of Javascript is considered the end of Web 1.\n  Web 2.0 is the web where public interaction between people is encouraged. This leads to formation of online communities and movements, but also to privatization of web by big tech firms. Cryptocurrencies are considered the end of Web 2.\n  Web3 is a decentralized version of web that uses zero-knowledge p2p communication tools, blockchains to transfer wealth, DeFi to generate income and NFTs to represent assets.\n\n\nWeb3 is a new iteration of the World Wide Web that is designed to leverage blockchain technology.\n\nThe whole concept is pretty vague because Web3 is still in the making. The reality of Web3 can be a lot of different things in the future, but one thing is for sure – a lot of money is going to change hands as Web3 develops.\n\nBlockchain-based payments are only a small part of the idea\n\nThe vision of Web3 includes a payment system based in cryptocurrencies, as well as collectibles and virtual Metaverse properties, but those are actually the smaller part of the idea.\n\nAs depicted very well in this PCMag article, the main point is to have the whole Internet run on a public network similar to blockchain.\n\nThe appeal of this idea is to have all information out in the open, on a public ledger. This would in theory protect the world from fake data. At the same time, the network would have to be pseudonymous since Web3 promises to protect users from privacy leaks on behalf of big technology companies that currently collect user data and metadata.\n\nThis idea hasn’t developed into more detail yet.\n\nCriticisms of Web3\n\nCriticisms of Web 3.0 point mainly to what hasn’t been done yet: How can Web3 make sure there will be no abuse, how can Web3 protect the privacy of those who need to stay hidden (such as whistleblowers) and lastly, if it is indeed possible to have a decentralized blockchain if that blockchain has a CEO.\n\nThose are legitimate concerns as we have seen in 2022 Binance booting some geolocations for political reasons.\n\nOn the other hand, Monero does have a CEO and yet it doesn’t seem to impact its features in the direction of lessening the privacy of the currency.\n\nDeFi and NFTs are the most developed aspects of Web3\n\nRight now, the way Web3 is portrayed by media consists of established brands releasing NFTs, mostly as an affordable way to appear in-touch.\n\n\n\nNFTs do have potential practical use cases in Web3, in that NFTs can represent legal documents on blockchain.\n\nAs of yet, NFTs are mostly used in online entertainment. DApp games like CryptoKitties or NFTs make digital assets available to everyone. Anyone who has a half-decent smartphone can own their own digital assets, without having any central intermediaries involved in it.\n\nDeFi is way further in development. DeFi applications such as staking apps or yield generation platforms based on smart contracts provide an opportunity to earn interest-like income on your savings. There’s a somewhat established industry around auditing the smart contracts that power DeFi platforms.\n\nLargest Web3 cryptocurrencies\n\nIf you were wondering how to access Web3, then maybe stop wondering because since you’re reading a website called altcointrading.net, you probably interact with Web3 regularly.\n\nJust as Javascript was considered the break from Web 1.0 to Web 2.0, the inception of cryptocurrencies is now taken as the break between Web 2.0 and Web 3.0. If you ever bought or traded a cryptocurrency, you have interacted with Web 3.0.\n\nWeb3 is in its early stages, so there’s a lot of opportunity to get involved and shape its future.\n\nIf you want to be part of something groundbreaking, here are some of the largest cryptos and blockchain platforms that focus most of all on Web3.\n\n\n  Ethereum - The oldest Web3 blockchain with plenty of stablecoins, DeFi and NFTs\n  Binance Smart Chain - Binance-powered network with its own stablecoin, DeFi staking and NFTs.\n  Polygon Network - A PoS ecosystem with USDC stablecoin, yield generating platforms, NFT art and games.\n\n\nAs a p2p trading platform the most private one is however not a DeFi exchange but the LocalCryptos zero-knowledge marketplace.\n",

      title: "BTC.D",
      content: "BTC.D stands for Bitcoin Dominance, or if we’re talking about the chartable metric, for the Bitcoin Dominance Index.\n\nBitcoin Dominance is a measure of Bitcoin’s success because it measures how big Bitcoin’s market capitalization is compared to the market caps of the rest of cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe general BTC.D formula is:\n\nMarket Cap of Bitcoin / ( Market Cap of Bitcoin + Market Cap of Other Coins)\n\nBut there are two versions of calculating Bitcoin Dominance:\n\n  Market cap of Bitcoin vs market cap of all other cryptocurrencies\n  Market cap of Bitcoin vs market cap of all non-ICO Proof-of-Work cryptocurrencies\n\n\nBitcoin was created to be a hard money, meaning it would have all of the properties of sound money that fiat currencies lack. That includes fixed supply, among other things. The situation with most Meme tokens, NFT coins and staking coins is very different. Coins like Shiba Inu have extremely bloated supply while the infamous Luna had fully elastic supply.\n\nThe more restrictive variant can be found at Real Bitcoin Dominance Index and as of mid June 2022 sits at around 70%. Compared to that, the more popular version of Bitcoin Dominance Index sits at 45%.\n\n\n  This version of the index is calculated by TradingView and can be charted as the ticker BTC.D on TradingView charts.\n\n\nThe most substantial critic against the restrictive BTC.D would be that it does not include Ethereum. At this stage of crypto industry, that is not very reasonable.\n\nMost crypto traders use the dominance index as found on TradingView.\n\nHow to trade BTC.D\n\n\n  \n    You can use technical analysis on BTC.D, it works well with the classic support/resistance lines. Here’s a June 2022 idea published on TradingView. The author speculates that since BTC.D was rejected at a resistance level, the crypto markets will turn short term bullish with altcoins leading. That should last until BTC.D trails back down to a support and bounces.\n  \n  \n    You can also chart the dominance of other coins. Tradingview lets you chart multiple tickers stacked in a single window and it can also do add or subtract tickers. So, you can chart BTC.D+ETH.D or BTC.D-ETH.D, for instance.\n  \n  \n    Bullish BTC.D correlates with bearish crypto markets in general. The idea behind this is that smaller alts are usually leading because there is all the narrative for them. Usually, when Bitcoin’s dominance grows, it’s because the broad market conditions changed and everyone is exiting alts.\n  \n\n\nBest Tools for trading on fundamentals in Crypto\n\n\n  Charting Tool: Tradingview\n\n\nRead our list of tools for crypto traders for more free and freemium options.\n",

      title: "ROC",
      content: "ROC, or Rate of Change, is a technical indicator that helps you to be on the lookout for a new trend in the market.\n\nThe Rate of Change indicator is a pure momentum indicator. It measures the velocity of price change. That is the percentage change in price from period to period, so you can identify potential trend shifts before they happen.\n\nThe difference between how fast price is moving vs how much it is moving is crucial when you want to analyse momentum: If the price of Ethereum sits at 1000 USD and increases by 50 USD every day, then the rate of change will be showing a slowdown. An increase from 1050 USD to 1100 USD is a lower percentage increase than the jump from 1000 USD to 1050 USD.\n\nThe Rate of Change formula is as follows:\n\nROC = 100 * (New price - Old price)/(Old price)\n\nWhat a simple indicator, but helps so much with your charting.\n\nROC formula in Excel: exaggerates every show of weakness or strength\n\nThe simplicity of ROC also makes it super easy to use in Excel or Spreadsheets, using it to help you interpret any sort of time series data. Here’s the ROC of a time series of non-finance data.\n\nNotice that at a time when the time series still looked like it’s “holding up quite well”, the ROC was already painting a very different picture.\n\nROC exaggerates every show of weakness or strength.\n\n\n\nROC is available on Bitfinex and FTX\n\nROC is really dead simple and it’s available in the basic set of TA tools on popular custodial exchanges. Of course you can get ROC in TradingView library as well.\n\n\n\nROC in the indicator pack on FTX.com\n\n\n\nROC on Bitfinex\n\nHow to trade with ROC\n\nThe ROC is a momentum oscillator that can be used to identify changes in the market trend. It is best used to verify buy and sell signals, not as a standalone strategy.\n\n\n  Crossover ROC oscillates between negative and positive values. One simple signal that traders read is the crossover of ROC over 0, which is the middle line. This, on long enough timeframes, can be an early signal of reversal.\n  S/R: In some markets, ROC can keep its own support and resistance levels. It depends on the market though - less volatile, mature markets have more of this tendency. In crypto, it only makes sense to consider doing this in the biggest markets.\n  Divergence ROC can be used to check for divergences instead of MACD or RSI. This makes it a popular tool among traders who are not fond of the RSI family of indicators.\n\n\nBearish ROC divergence\n\nWhen a cryptocurrency rallies to a new high but the ROC indicator makes a lower high, that is a warning the trend might soon reverse because the price and momentum are not matching. That’s a bearish divergence: Underlying weakness in an uptrend.\n\nBullish ROC divergences\n\nWhen the price action drills down, approaching or making new lows, but the ROC is grinding up, that points to an underlying strength in the market.\n\nUsing ROC with other indicators\n\nSo, ROC is not a good indicator to be used on its own - much like divergences aren’t.\n\nBecause it is a momentum oscillator, the best complements to it would be volume profiles or any other volume indicators like OBV.\n\nCharting support and resistance price-wise makes a lot of sense too. Even better is charting such levels in terms of Bollinger Bands - as a distance from a standard deviation.\n\nBottom line\n\nWith ROC, you can trade verify your momentum analysis confidence knowing that you have all the information you need right at your fingertips. It’s a fairly simple indicator, you won’t misinterpret it even if you wanted to. It’s also widely available, including in the basic version of TradingView charts on Bitfinex.\n",

      title: "Retroactive Airdrop",
      content: "Retroactive airdrops are a special type of crypto airdrops that is preferred by some airdrop hunters these days.\n\nThe majority preference for crypto airdrops are airdrops that payout as fast as possible. Airdrop and bounty hunters want to be paid quickly and in tokens (fungible or non-fungible) that can be quickly dumped for stablecoins or Bitcoin. That is the general preference.\n\nWhat are retroactive airdrops\n\nTo the contrary of the common preference, retroactive airdrops don’t pay immediately. To participate, you usually need to provide liquidity or do some engagement tasks for a platform that is just being launched.\n\nIf you make it among a certain limit of early contributors, you get whitelisted for token airdrops and promo events in the future.\n\nThis makes retroactive airdrops riskier than plain airdrops, because you could be sending money to an unaudited platform or to a project that will exit scam. On the other hand, the potential gains are higher - as it should always be with risk and reward.\n\nThe platforms most commonly associated with retroactive airdrops are decentralized projects: The DEX trading platforms Uniswap and DyDX, and then ENS which is the Ethereum Name Service.\n\nAn alternative to DEX retroactive airdrops\n\nSince the boom of NFT trading in 2021, NFTs have of course permeated the airdrop industry as well.\n\n\n\nWhile some hunters scoff at NFT airdrops, the reason being you often can’t sell the NFT easily, there is a new type of airdrop promo that uses NFTs as keys to revenue generation in the future.\n\nSome of these NFTs are necessary to access a play-to-earn game. Some will whitelist a wallet that holds them for future airdrops and other will pay out revenue share to the wallet that holds them.\n\nCollecting these NFTs is less risky than OG retroactive airdrops as you do not need to provide any liquidity. On the other hand, holding such NFTs is pretty close to affiliate income, for which you need the project to actually earn something.\n\nKeep in mind that there will be a lot of failed projects in this space and a lot of “NFT keys” will end up worthless.\n",

      title: "KC (Keltner Channels & BB/KC Squeeze)",
      content: "KC, or Keltner channels, are a technical analysis tool used to chart the relative volatility of a market.  The tool was developed by Chester Keltner, and is remarkably similar to Bollinger bands in that the Keltner channel paints a moving average with two bands of either side of the price action.\n\n\n\nKeltner Channels: What are they and how to use them\n\nUnlike the BBands, Keltner channel uses the ATR, or average true range, to paint the upper and lower boundaries of the “usual”, balanced price action. BBands use the standard deviation for that.\n\nKeltner channels can be used in any market, but they are most popular in the Forex market.\n\nJust like with BBands, this has to do with the fact that band indicators that oscillate around a mean are great for pair markets - currencies and cryptocurrencies.\n\nHow to interpret Keltner on charts\n\n\n\nKC is the pink dotted channel. Pine Script: Bollinger Bands and Keltner Channel (BB and KC) by AsyrafDaud on TradingView\n\nIn broad strokes, the interpretation of Keltner channel is not much different from how you read the BBands. The band in both cases delimits the area in which the price action tends to stay. If it’s trending strongly, it will get quite far out of the band but eventually it will correct to some place inside it.\n\nIn this way, Keltner channels just like Bbands help traders identify whether a market is ranging or if it is trending.\n\n\n  \n    A ranging market has bands of uniform width. Market mostly bounces off the outer bands rather than from the moving average in the middle.\n  \n  \n    A trending market will have the price shoot to an outer band and then correct, but often the correction will only reach the middle band and bounce there. Another sign of a trending market is the variable width of the bands; they will first get squeezed to extreme narrow width and then they’ll get very far apart.\n  \n\n\nThe BB/KC squeeze: A more precise trading setup\n\nThe BB/KC squeeze is short for the BBands and Keltner channel squeeze.\n\nAny squeeze in either Bollinger bands (BB) or in Keltner Channel (KC) is a trading pattern that occurs when the bands get close together. This shows that the volatility on that market is extremely low. The next step is generally a breakout, in other words a period of high volatility, which will widen the bands.\n\nYou can build either a BB or a KC squeeze into your trading strategy as a tool that helps you time an approaching move.\n\nThen there is a BB/KC squeeze as a separate tool, which brings a small improvement.\n\nWhen you see both the upper and lower Bollinger Bands going inside of the Keltner Channel, only then you even consider trading the squeeze. This is when you look to other indicators and on fundamentals to decide on the direction of the breakout.\n\nWhen later the BBands start coming out of the KC on either side again, that’s the time to enter the position.\n\nWhy is the BB/KC combo useful in crypto\n\nThe BB/KC is a known tool among scalpers and other short term traders. It’s one of the tool that adds a definitive point of entry into your strategy.\n\nWithout the combo of BB and KC, there is usually not enough information for a setup in the short term - the bands change width all the time, it’s near impossible to tell if the market is ready to break out yet.\n\n\n\nAnd then especially on shorter timeframes, the squeeze often doesn’t even get so tight. There’s just not much to trade on, really. Most technical analysts wouldn’t even call that kind of narrowing a squeeze.\n\nWell, the joint tool of BB and KC provides the missing data point.\n\nIf you use TradingView FREE with the limited number of indicators, use this script that plots both BB and KC in a single indicator:\n\n\n  Bollinger Bands and Keltner Channel (BB and KC) by AsyrafDaud on TradingView\n\n\nYou may still find BB/KC useful even if you are not a scalper. Using both BB and KC makes the timing more accurate, you will enter your position a shorter time ahead of the breakout.\n\nCrypto traders have been using the BB/KC squeeze in the past bear markets and it does work well in the flat, drawn-out bottoms of the bear where nobody cares about crypto anymore.\n\nAs explained before though, neither BB, KC nor their combination gives any information on the direction of the breakout. If you want to speculate on the direction during a BB/KC squeeze, you will need to use other indicators to give you the idea of what the odds are for either direction.\n\nUsing KC with other technical indicators\n\nKeltner channels can always be used in conjunction with other technical indicators to help make trading decisions. They can also be used on their own to identify potential trade opportunities.\n\nSome of the most popular technical indicators that can be used with Keltner channels include Moving Averages, MACD, and various RSI variations.\n\nThese indicators inform you about momentum of the market which can help confirm whether a security is in a trading range or trending.\n\nBest Trading tools for Keltner Channels trading\n\n\n  Trading Platform: Bitfinex\n  Charting App: TradingView\n  List of tools for crypto traders with more options\n\n\nKeltner Channels are available in Tradingview.\n\nGet your FREE TradingView account here to access the charting app.\n",

      content: "\n  Tell us who you are how did you get into crypto?\n\n\nI am David Attias, I trade and develop strategies and scripts in pine for clients via TradingView and best-trading-indicator.com.\n\nThe first time ever that I invested in crypto was in April 2017. Back then I was betting big on Litecoin - I believed this was a “cheaper Bitcoin”… Back then I knew nothing about blockchain, tokenomics, FDV or any other fundamentals. I was literally buying every new shiny coins.\n\n\n  You are a top TradingView script developer. What was the most interesting kind of script you have worked on?\n\n\nNot so long ago I published a free and open-source script to transform any indicator into a backtestable strategy with statistics.\n\n\nThe concept is simple - One only needs to do three things:\n\n1) add 2 lines of code in his/her indicator\n2) then add both the Strategy template and his indicator on the same chart\n3) and connect his/her indicator from the strategy template settings\n\nHere is the script: Ultimate Strategy Template on TradingView\n\n\n  What did your work in the trading community teach you?\n\n\nProbably that most traders think that complex systems and high number of trades a day end up making more money - but it’s actually the contrary.\n\n\nThe simpler the better, and the less often you trade the less fatigued you get. That translates into making less mistakes, less losing trades and generally it produces less stress.\n\n\n  Business-wise, where do you see yourself in 5 year’s time?\n\n\nI plan to focus on growing my platform where I teach others my trading method and I provide them with TradingView scripts to trade my favourite signals.\n\n\n  Who is the one personality in crypto that had the most influence on you?\n\n\nIn trading, CanteringClark. Very down-to-earth trader, doesn’t have a preference for direction - “numbers go up or down” - he just trades what he sees and not what he hopes will happen.\n\n\n  Shill me your favourite cryptocurrency or platform!\n\n\nMy favorite platform is the NFT marketplace LooksRare. I’m getting some $LOOKS rewards for trading NFTs there.\n\nMy favorite cryptocurrency is $STEPN, I love the concept of walking every day and getting paid for it.\n",

      content: "Welcome to the list of upcoming crypto airdrops, bounties and exchange promos with the update note for October 2022.\n\nIn the past weeks, we have seen the volume of airdrops thin down. One of the blockchains that still gets a decent volume of opportunities is MATIC with new tokens launching there.\n\nOther than that, trading competitions and exchange promos are getting better in terms of how much they pay, but not in terms of how many people get actually paid.\n\nAt the moment, the three exchanges that offer regular trading competitions are Phemex, Bitforex and Bitmart. The exchanges CEX.io and LATOKEN run Gleam airdrop events almost every week.\n\nNew type of airdrop scam is getting popular\n\nWhile the system of token key or NFT key as a condition to receive future airdrops is pretty censorship resistant, it also naturally makes it the prime avenue for scammers.\n\nIn the past weeks, we have seen an increasing number of airdrops that claim to pay tokens only to addresses that hold an NFT key that however needs to be purchased. One of such listings is still up on Opensea.\n\nThis is the same scam as the good old “send 0.1 ETH to receive giveaway” that was everywhere on Twiiter at one point. There will be no airdrop, the address will just pocket the payment for the NFT key and vanish.\n\nAirdrops are a promotional tool, do not ever pay any money to participate - not even for an NFT key.\n\nAirdrops Alert\n\nThe lists below are updated daily. Come back every evening and check the updates!\n\nIf you prefer social though:\n\n\n  Get alerts on new airdrops on Twitter: Tweet sends as soon as the airdrop list below updates. No alerts on bounties or promos there.\n  Read the daily airdrop digests on Medium: The digest includes exchange promos and alerts on ending soon airdrops.\n  Daily ending soon airdrops on Telegram: Just a plain list of campaigns ending in the days to come, arrives every day.\n\n",

The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. - See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf\n\nAccording to CalOPPA we agree to the following: Users can visit our site anonymously Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page, or as a minimum on the first significant page after entering our website. Our Privacy Policy link includes the word ‘Privacy’, and can be easily be found on the page specified above.\n\nUsers will be notified of any privacy policy changes:\n\n= By a “Last updated” note at the top of this page.\n\nHow does our site handle do not track signals?\n\n= We honor do not track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.\n\nDoes our site allow third party behavioral tracking?\n\n= It’s also important to note that we allow third party behavioral tracking.\n\nCOPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)\n\nWhen it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the nation’s consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children’s privacy and safety online.\n\n= We do not specifically market to children under 13.\n\nFair Information Practices\n\nThe Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.\n\nIn order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:\n\n= We will reserve the right to change this section without notifying our users since we collect no contact information to our users.\n\nWe also agree to the individual redress principle, which requires that individuals have a right to pursue legally enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or a government agency to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.\n\nCAN SPAM Act\n\nThe CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.\n\n= We collect email addresses to send out weekly newsletters. Every email sent by us contains an unsubscribe link in the footer.\n\nContacting Us\n\nIf there are any questions regarding this privacy policy you may contact us at privacy (at) altcointrading (dot) net.\n\n.\n",

Cryptocurrencies do not represent a claim on any issuer or by any third party and they have no intrinsic value.\n\nDue to various causes, the value of cryptocurrencies may be wholly or partially lost. The value of cryptocurrencies can fluctuate significantly.\n\nMost of cryptocurrency trading happens on unregulated platforms that can be subject to heists or fraud, by a third party as well as by the platform management.\n\nNo supervision\n\nPublic cryptocurrencies are not regulated by any government. Cryptocurrency wallets can not be compared with a bank account in this context.\n\nCryptocurrency trading is not regulated in most countries. Nor trading cryptocurrencies falls within the scope of the Act on Financial Supervision (Wft). If you trade in cryptocurrencies the Act on Financial Supervision (Wft) therefore offers no protection.\n\nYou may be barred from trading cryptocurrency derivatives, if you are a resident or citizen of United States and some other countries.

These wallets can be considered to be vulnerable due to potential security flaws, which then makes them a target for hackers.\n\nFor those who wish to continue to use them, it could be considered worth just keeping a small amount in a wallet, while also having a more robust cold wallet like Ledger in order to best protect themselves from an attack.\n\n2/ Lack of Rudimentary Knowledge of Crypto\n\nThe excitement around virtual assets may draw in new crypto investors, but the influencers conveniently forgot to pass on anything else but memes.\n\nBut in crypto, the technical knowledge of the asset class and its operations is crucial. During the Luna collapse, investors would admit on Twitter they did not understand what elastic supply meant. They somehow assumed that every crypto is at its core pretty much the same as Bitcoin.\n\nIt is a formula for disaster to try to trade crypto or just invest in any asset you don’t comprehend without having a fundamental knowledge of how cryptocurrencies operate.\n\n\n\nYou may have noticed that a bitcoin casino has become available to utilize that gives everyone around the world the ability to use their crypto to bet on sports or their favorite games. This is one of the use cases that resulted in a lot of new people getting into crypto. The issue is that with crypto, you are your own bank. If you do not have the knowledge of how to handle your crypto, then you could be in for an expensive lesson.\n\nA cursory research will usually do it, though, so it is certainly worth spending the time.\n\n3/ Poor Storage of Passwords and Seed Phrases\n\nThis one is an evergreen.\n\nCryptocurrency is stored in a digital wallet and access to the wallet app usually needs a password or a PIN code.\n\nWhile your cryptocurrency is easy to recover when you lose the password or PIN, you will not recover it if you lose your seed phrase.\n\nMost wallets offer a backup seed word to access the cash, but if you forget or lose the seed phrase, or if you don’t store it well and get it exposed, there will be no way to get your money back.\n\n4/ Short-term Thinking\n\nMany new investors only think in the short term due to the market’s promise to “get rich quick.”\n\nAnd although investing in cryptocurrencies seems like it has certainly done just that for some people, the reality is that most of these people got in when everyone and their grandma told them it is a scam bound to crash any second, and they kept stacking for a few years through that.\n\nSome say that the market is a device that redistributes money from the rash to the patient. Either way, the potential to yield good returns still exists in crypto, just as the risk of a devastating loss.\n\n\n\n5/ Use of Leverage\n\nShocker: 100x is bad for you.\n\nStories of people making it rich through cryptocurrency trading may tempt new crypto investors to fire up that leverage to increase their earnings.\n\nLeveraged trading has its place for sure. But the drawback is that it requires you to maintain collateral. Leverage has two sides and can increase your gains and losses.\n\n\n\n6/ Getting Scammed\n\nScammers thrive in the crypto market since it is a new asset class. Since its early days, the business side of crypto got regulated. Unsurprisingly, that doesn’t stop scammers on Twitter and in the airdrop industry.\n\nAnother type of common scam is phishing. You probably received an email or a text from an imposter urging you to update your Trust Wallet or your Exodus. Phishing is just a reality of the crypto industry.\n\nAlways check the sending email address and never give your seed phrase to anyone.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nCrypto trading and investing is certainly a general high-risk endeavor. There are multiple risks to consider, but the biggest is that you never really know what the future holds. It’s an exciting time to explore these new financial markets, but there are also plenty of things to watch out for.\n ]]>\n        \n        \n        Wed, 19 Oct 2022 11:02:00 +0000\n        https://www.altcointrading.net/2022-snafus-biggest-mistakes-crypto-holders-made/\n        https://www.altcointrading.net/2022-snafus-biggest-mistakes-crypto-holders-made/\n        en\n        \n      \n    \n      \n        \n        \n        The crypto niche has been growing and developing, adding new features almost every year: Altcoins, dApps, NFTs.\n\nEven though some people consider any crypto a risky investment, some forecast the growth in popularity of crypto. Some are interested in crypto not only in terms of investing but also in running crypto businesses.\n\nThe niche requires more and more niche services so there is a lot of potential for business owners to develop and expand.\n\nAs the crypto industry is booming, SEO strategies that were once used to promote a website in this niche are no longer effective. Google algorithms are constantly changing and evolving too, so SEO specialists need to keep up with the latest trends and update their approaches.\n\nIn this article, we will tell you about the most effective SEO practices for getting organic traffic to a cryptocurrency website in 2022.\n\nWhat Is SEO for Crypto?\n\nCrypto SEO is a marketing niche that focuses on traffic generation in the crypto industry.\n\nIt measures and methods aimed at improving the visibility and organic search results of a website in Google and other search engines.\n\nThe main goal of crypto SEO is to make a site takes one of the leading positions in SERP for the targeted queries. If you want to use the most effective strategies, address the СryptoSEO Agency and their professionals will help you achieve your business goals.\n\nSEO for cryptocurrency includes such activities as:\n\n\n  On-page optimization;\n  Technical optimization;\n  Link building;\n  Content marketing, etc.\n\n\nThe goal of every crypto SEO expert is to bring organic traffic to the website for queries related to its niche. As in any other industry these days, that won’t happen without SEO work.\n\nWhat to Consider When Doing Crypto SEO?\n\nWhen promoting a website in the cryptocurrency niche, you need to take into account some of the specific features of this industry. Here are some things to consider when doing crypto SEO:\n\nThe niche is constantly evolving;\n\n\n  New projects appear every day;\n  Google algorithms are changing;\n  The number of searches is growing;\n  The competition is high.\n\n\nGiven the specifics of the crypto industry, it is good to keep track of the latest trends and update your content and promo strategies accordingly. For instance, several trading platforms adapted to change in the market and started offering airdrops and promos to attract people who are new to crypto.\n\nOnly by following the latest trends and using effective methods, you will be able to achieve success in promoting your website in this niche.\n\nHow to Do Crypto SEO?\n\nThere is no single answer to the question of how to do crypto SEO and you will almost always need to find a targeted approach with an agency.\n\nThe best way to promote a website in this niche depends on various factors, such as the goals, budget, and target audience of the project.\n\nHowever, there are some universal tips that will help you promote your website effectively:\n\n\n  Use long-tail keywords;\n  Conduct keyword research;\n  Optimize your website for mobile devices;\n  Improve the user experience on your site;\n  Publish high-quality content;\n  Build links from crypto websites.\n\n\nThese are just some of the basic things you need to consider when doing crypto SEO. If you want to get more organic traffic, you should also make sure that you are using other approaches.\n\nLet’s have a look at some of them.\n\n\n  \n    Content\n\n    The first and most important thing you need to do is to create quality content. It should be informative, well-structured, and based on reliable sources. Google loves high-quality content and it will definitely help your website to rank higher. You can also use various tools to check whether your content is good enough.\n  \n  \n    Use relevant keywords\n\n    You would be surprised how many seemingly niche websites get most of their organic traffic from completely unrelated keywords!\n\n    You should always target relevant keywords. They will help both Google and advertisers to understand what your website is about and index it accordingly. You can use various tools to find the most relevant keywords for your website.\n  \n  \n    Make sure your website is mobile-friendly\n\n    Nowadays, more and more people use their smartphones to browse the Internet. That is why it is crucial to make sure that your website is mobile-friendly. Google also takes into account whether a website is mobile-friendly when ranking it. You can use various tools to check your website’s mobile-friendliness and make the necessary changes.\n  \n  \n    Use social media\n\n    Social media is a great way to promote your website. You can automate creating posts about your project on various social media platforms with marketing tools, there is plenty of them to choose from.\n  \n\n\nWhy is SEO important?\n\nGoogle and other search engines, responding to user requests, collect, systematize and display information. To release relevant information, they go through three main processes, including:\n\n\n  Scanning. Search engines use crawlers, also known as web spiders or simply bots, to find fresh content on the Internet. Search robots help to identify and collect information necessary for indexing a page. Bots go from page to page, link to link to scan all the information.\n  Indexing. The process by which search engines organize and store web pages they collect. As soon as search engines find information such as keywords and fresh content, they will add the web page to the search index. When users search for certain information, the search engine selects the appropriate indexed site.\n  Rating. Next, a ranking of the results will be formed depending on the relevance - the pages that, in the opinion of the search engine, are the best for the search query will be shown first.\n\n\nSEO improves your online presence by making your site more attractive to search engines. In other words, search engine optimization determines how successfully your site will go through the entire process - from crawling to ranking.\n\nFor example, well-structured internal links on your pages make it easier for search engines to navigate from one page to another. This allows them to study the resource in detail and index more content. Search engine algorithms also take into account other ranking factors, such as relevant keywords, quality of external links, and content relevance (how long it has been updated). Thus, optimizing the content of the site taking into account these factors can significantly improve its position in the search.\n\nIn Conclusion\n\nThese are the basic but still effective SEO practices for promoting a cryptocurrency website in 2022. If you follow these tips, you can’t fail to get positive results. For a targeted plan it is always best to work with an agency, though.\n ]]>\n        \n        \n        Thu, 13 Oct 2022 22:02:00 +0000\n        https://www.altcointrading.net/business-getting-organic-traffic-crypto-seo/\n        https://www.altcointrading.net/business-getting-organic-traffic-crypto-seo/\n        en\n        \n      \n    \n      \n        \n        \n        VTrend is a volume trading strategy with a bunch of features packed into a single TradingView script.\n\nOn the face of it VTrend looks a bit like Ichimoku cloud but it’s made of different market metrics. It still gives a lot of information at a single glance.\n\nThis is what it looks like:\n\n\n\nYou can use VTrend in TradingView’s free tier as well - make an account if you don’t have one.\n\nVTrend is a premium script that costs 420 USD per year with shill link.\n\nI’ll first go over the elements you see on the VTrend chart and then make an example of how to read and interpret that.\n\nVolume-weighted bands for support and resistance\n\nThe first feature you’ll notice are the volume-weighted bands - the blue and red bands that look a bit like Ichimoku cloud.\n\nReading the bands is similar to reading moving averages in the fast vs slow chart setup: You look for crossovers. When the faster blue band crosses below the slower red band, it confirms the market is in a downtrend.\n\nThe VTrend bands are volume-weighted, but the crossovers it shows are not far from what you get with 50/200 EMA/SMA crossover. (I used this script from the free library.)\n\n\n\nAnd then, they come with an upper and lower boundary. Premium TradingView scripts don’t usually open the script’s pine code for viewing so I am just guessing here like the rest of you.\n\nThe areas of the bands mark the key zones where the market might reverse or stop to make a range, especially when you combine that information with other support and resistance charting tools, or with tools like a volume profile.\n\nOn long timeframes like the weekly, the volume-weighted bands give a single glance overview of where the market is at.\n\nThat’s all just like an MA, except VTrend paints a range rather than a line. It’s easier to work with visually and can give you a small advantage.\n\nPrice-based data for psychological turning points\n\nIn addition to volume data, the script paints daily, weekly, monthly and yearly open price into your chart.\n\nOn long timeframes, this is a valuable tool because milestone open prices can form a psychological boundary that turns into a support or resistance zone.\n\nThe idea behind this is a simplification of the concept of market profile. In market profile theory, you chart a volume profile for each trading day. Then you take a look at what the market does around the level with highest traded volume: Does it bounce away from that level or does it blast through? This says a lot about the market sentiment even when the price changes relatively a little.\n\nOn daily and weekly charts, you can look at monthly and yearly opens in addition to volume data.\n\nHere’s an example from 2021 and 2022. In 2021, the yearly open of ~29000 USD acted as a support on multiple occasions and eventually, BTC made an all-time-high from there. In 2022 however, the market failed to stay above the yearly open of ~46000 USD.\n\n\n\nI also looked at shorter time frames, overlaying VTrend on a 30M chart with a daily fix-range volume profile (I used this script from the free library).\n\n\n\nThat the daily opens (orange lines) under the market conditions of October 2022 are at about the same level as the daily volume point of control (teal line, the peak of each day’s volume profile).\n\nThat shows that the market isn’t trending.\n\nCharting the daily opens together with the volume points of control can be a good addition to your setup for trend analysis.\n\nTrend reversals and the entry signals\n\nThe last set of VTrend features are the reversals and the entry points.\n\nThey are all black box - you won’t get to see on which logic they are based and there is no way to figure it out, they’re just points on the chart.\n\nYou can automate your trading based on them though. Paid TradingView plans support webhooks that can integrate with your trading bot or with a bot platform like Coinrule.\n\nThe author of the VTrend strategy backtested a few setups on forex markets, ETHUSD and BTCUSD chart in early 2022.\n\nMore backtesting results on vtrendscript.com/#results but generally the trades in the backtest risked 500 USD per trade starting with 5000 USD balance, had a 3% stop and would let the profits run.\n\nIn the backtest each trade ran with a trailing stop until it got stopped out either in loss or in profit. That’s a pretty good method. Starting ratio was 1.5 reward to 1 risk.\n\nThis setup gave very high PnLs in crypto and much lower in forex, from which I would guess a part of those high profits was letting the winning trades run while crypto was trending.\n\nYou will probably not hit such a high PnL in ranging market conditions. Get the free trial and test it yourself, though.\n\nHere’s crypto backtest:\n\n\n\nVTrend backtest: BTCUSD on 25m, 58 trades in total, 500 USD out of initial 5000 USD per trade.\n\nAnd here’s forex:\n\n\n\nVTrend backtest: USDCAD on 1h, 74 trades in total, 500 USD out of initial 5000 USD per trade.\n\nTrend reversals (Exit signals)\n\nThe diamond dots painted in VTrend chart mark trend reversal signals. The author recommends using them as a signal to mark the exit areas. You might still let you trade run but with a tighter stop, for instance.\n\nBy looking at the longer time frames, the reversal signals might work with volume. At the 2021 weekly chart, the reversal is signalled at the 45k USD level in early January.\n\nSee the yellow diamond there:\n\n\n\nThat was the early high-volume peak that due to market psychology and greed usually proceeds to run away further up on lower volume.\n\nOn shorter timeframes they tend to be more accurate.\n\nEntry signals\n\nThe round dots on the chart are entry signals. The different colours separate trades with or against trends and different levels of riskiness. These are the entry signals used in the author’s backtest.\n\nThe author says that the script generates the signals based on volume and momentum criteria, but uses additional filters to remove false positives.\n\n\n  The red and green circles signal that the price is just about to break downwards or upwards respectively. These signals passed all filters and are less risky to take.\n  The purple and orange circles signal a position you’d be taking against the trend.\n  The olive circles are risky trades where you’d be taking a position against the trend.\n\n\nI had to adjust some of these in settings, I didn’t like the default settings where it’s all circles.\n\n\n\nI changed the colours of the diamonds because I use a dark chart layout. Then I changed the shapes of the entry signals. There’s a ton of them, they are painted above or below the price action to suggest the direction but changing the shapes still ends up working better for me.\n\nChanging the olive signals to triangles of a respective direction helped me read the chart much easier.\n\nI also changed the signals that are against the trend to squares.\n\n\n\nHere’s my settings:\n\n\n\nWhat I thought\n\nI did not run a backtest but following the entry signals, the sell signals are consistently painted quite late: Compare the red dots and the green dots between 30M, 4H and 1D.\n\nThis shows that the script will perform better in a bull than in a bear, the short positions will not be entered soon enough.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, taking the riskier signals on shorter timeframes with a tight stop might still make good results, as long as you can trade cheap. It will make you trade a lot of chop so you need cheap trading to make small wins still profitable after fees.\n\nAs for charting and manual trading, I liked it a lot. I think the VTrend script makes reading the chart easier and saves time on that if you like working with indicators that have roughly the format of the Ichimoku cloud.\n\nVTrend is based on different market metrics, has vastly more functions and gives more and clearer signals; however, it still has the single-glance look of Ichimoku. I got used to working with it pretty fast.\n\nVolume-aware traders who have the eye for it and trade occasionally enough to not be burnt out from staring at charts would have mostly spotted these signals without the script as well.\n\nBut that’s the thing, VTrend has that all done for you and painted on the chart.\n\nThe cost is 420 USD per year, or 50 USD monthly, and it’s a single script. TradingView’s FREE plan that caps you at 3 indicators per chart.\n\n\n  Get VTrend here\n  Get a TradingView Free account\n\n ]]>\n        \n        \n        Tue, 11 Oct 2022 21:02:00 +0000\n        https://www.altcointrading.net/vtrend-volume-trading-strategy-tradingview-premium-script-review/\n        https://www.altcointrading.net/vtrend-volume-trading-strategy-tradingview-premium-script-review/\n        en\n        \n      \n    \n      \n        \n        \n        Power BI is a reporting tool made by Microsoft. It is geared towards businesses and provides tools like customizable dashboards, interactive visualizations or business intelligence. The interface was designed with simplicity in mind, so it’s easy enough even for new users to create their own reports.\n\nIf you do any type of business that handles any type of monetary transaction on a large scale – traditional business, trading stocks, trading cryptocurrencies, or keeping track of your winnings and other information of your winning from playing Grande Vegas online casino – there will be lot of data to go through every month.\n\nThe data needs to be stored, and the data needs to be analyzed. In this aspect, trading cryptocurrencies is no different from running a media agency.\n\nAs long as your business works on a small scale, then using Microsoft Excel to store and analyze the data will absolutely be enough.\n\nBut once your data reaches certain volumes, Excel will not cut it. Larger data sets need to be stored a database, for which you will need a more powerful user interface.\n\nIn that case, you may need to look into Power BI.\n\nWhat is Power BI?\n\nIn simple terms, Power BI is “Excel on steroids”.\n\nIn more sophisticated terms, Power BI is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to turn your unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights.\n\nThere are three main parts to Power BI.  The first if where the data is obtained from.  The second is the report generating of the data.  Third is the storage of the final data.\n\nHow can you plug data into Power BI?\n\nTo start working with a new set of data, the first thing you have to do is to get the data somewhere.\n\nYou can either “discover content” or you can “create new content”. Power BI supports all the common time series data sources that you can get from crypto exchanges either in your user account or programmatically via an API.\n\nSupported remote data sources:\n\n\n  File\n  Database\n  Power Platform\n  MS Azure cloud storage\n  Online Services\n  Custom implementations\n\n\nFile data sources:\n\n\n  MS Excel\n  Text\n  CSV (the typical exchange log format)\n  XML\n  JSON (the typical API endpoint format)\n  Compressed directory\n  PDF\n  Parquet (column based record text based record storage)\n  Sharepoint Folder\n\n\nSide Note: Parquet (column based data storage) is useful when you only need to work with a small amount of the data. Then you just read in the appropriate column into memory instead of the whole table into memory. This will not be useful is you are working with a dataset that has thousands of rows as the impact on memory would be too big. But if you want to analyze trading data from 50 trades, the column based data storage may make sense. This is actually a “new concept” in data storage, which is why I am making note of it.\n\nSupported Types of Databases:\n\n\n  SQL Server Database (Microsoft)\n  MS Access database\n  SQL Server Analysis Services database\n  Oracle database\n  MySQL database\n  PostgreSQL database\n  Amazon Redshift\n  Google BigQuery\n  Amazon Athena\n  BI Connector\n  MariaDB\n  SQLite\n\n\nAs you can see, Microsoft prefers their own products but still makes available plenty open source options such as MySQL, MariaDB or SQLite.\n\nIn fact, there even more different database data sources available to Power BI. I only listed a few of the most popular. Here is the Microsoft’s Power BI Documentation to get the rest.\n\nPower Platform Data Sources:\n\n\n  Power BI Datasets\n  Datamarts (preview)\n  Dataverse\n  Power Platforms Dataflows\n\n\nAzure Data Sources (Microsoft):\n\n\n  Azure SQL Database\n  Azure Database for PostgreSQL\n  Azure Blob Storage (storing data in binary format)\n  Azure Table Storage\n\n\nAll of the different Azure data sources are supported, but I did not list them all.  Azure is owned by Microsoft, so it would make sense that Microsoft Power BI would support all Azure options.\n\nOnline Services Data Sources:\n\n\n  SharePoint Online List\n  Microsoft Exchange Online\n  Dynamics 365 (Dataverse)\n  Dynamics NAV\n  Dynamics 365 Business Central\n  Azure DevOps (Boards only)\n  Azure DevOps Server (Boards only)\n  Salesforce Objects\n  Salesforce Reports\n  Google Analytics\n  Adobe Analytics\n  appFigures (Beta)\n  Data.World - Get Dataset (Beta)\n  GitHub (Beta)\n  LinkedIn Sales Navigator (Beta)\n  Marketo (Beta)\n  Mixpanel (Beta)\n  Planview Enterprise One - PRM (Beta)\n  QuickBooks Online (Beta)\n  Smartsheet\n  SparkPost (Beta)\n  SweetIQ (Beta)\n  Planview Enterprise One - CTM (Beta)\n  Zendesk (Beta)\n  Asana (Beta)\n  Assemble Views\n  Automation Anywhere\n  Automy Data Analytics (Beta)\n  Dynamics 365 Customer Insights (Beta)\n  Emigo Data Source\n  Entersoft Business Suite (Beta)\n  eWay-CRM\n  FactSet Analytics\n  Palantir Foundry\n  Funnel\n  Hexagon PPM Smart API\n  Industrial App Store\n  Intune Data Warehouse (Beta)\n  Projectplace for Power BI\n  Product Insights (Beta)\n  Profisee (Beta)\n  Quick Base\n  SoftOne BI (Beta)\n  Spigit (Beta)\n  TeamDesk (Beta)\n  Webtrends Analytics (Beta)\n  Witivio (Beta)\n  Viva Insights\n  Zoho Creator (Beta)\n\n\nThe reason that I listed all of them, instead of just the major ones,  is to indicate just how vesitile Power BI is.  Not even included traditional data flat files and traditional SQL database, Power BI can get data from 49 different online services.  And these are not even the “other” data sources that are in the next category.\n\n\n  Web\n  SharePoint list\n  OData Feed\n  Active Directory\n  Microsoft Exchange\n  Hadoop File (HDFS)\n  Spark\n  Hive LLAP\n  R script\n  Python script\n  ODBC\n  OLE DB\n  Acterys : Model Automation &amp; Planning (Beta)\n  Amazon OpenSearch Service (Beta)\n  Anaplan Connector Autodesk Construction Cloud (Beta)\n  Solver\n  BitSight Security Ratings\n  BQE Core\n  Bloomberg Data and Analytics\n  Cherwell (Beta)\n  Cognite Data Fusion\n  Delta Sharing\n  Eduframe (Beta)\n  EQuIS (Beta)\n  FactSet RMS (Beta)\n  FHIR\n  Google Sheets (Beta)\n  Information Grid (Beta)\n  Jamf Pro (Beta)\n  Kognitwin\n  MicroStrategy for Power BI\n  OpenSearch Project (Beta)\n  Paxata\n  QubolePresto (Beta)\n  Roamler (Beta)\n  SIS-CC SDMX (Beta)\n  Shortcuts Business Insights (Beta)\n  Siteimprove\n  Starburst Enterprise\n  SumTotal\n  SurveyMonkey (Beta)\n  Microsoft Teams Personal Analytics (Beta)\n  Tenforce (Smart)List\n  Usercube (Beta)\n  Vena\n  Vessel Insight\n  Zucchetti HR Infinity (Beta)\n  Blank Query\n\n\nSummary of all of the places to get data into Power BI\n\nMaybe it is because I was a software engineer, and my first job out of college was exporting data from one database system and importing it into “my company’s” database system (database written by my employer).  I look at that list and I am in awe.  I wrote the source code from scratch that can now be done in Power BI with just a few clicks of a button.\n\nBut even then, I was dealing with one data source.  Power BI can handle an infinite number of data sources of different data types, and when you are finished importing into Power BI, what the user sees on the screen is just the data that they want to see.  It does not matter that the name of the state came from Wikipedia and the number of births and deaths and population comes from the US Census Reports.  It is just data to the end user.\n\nAnd then you start defining the relationships of that data.  When I was doing that way back, I had to write code by hand.  Every new dataset was a new subprogram that had to be compiled and tested and documented.  But now, with Power BI … it is just a few clicks of the button.  The data dictionaries and data mapping and data flow diagrams that I used to have to draw by hand in the past, I just use Power BI templates and arrows (no different than drawing in Visio and Microsoft Word), I connect the data (draw the data relations) in Power BI … click done, and behind the scenes, Power BI does everything that I once had to do “by hand” with custom made code.\n\nDid I mention just how awestruck I am with Power BI and I have not even begun to talk about Power BI’s data analysis, report generation, and saving / exporting the final data, including creating data panels / data dashboards that update automatically as you update your data in Power BI.\n\nI know that the Israeli government used Power BI to display their data on their public website during the COVID-19 pandemic, and I am sure that they were not the only ones.\n ]]>\n        \n        \n        Fri, 30 Sep 2022 17:32:00 +0000\n        https://www.altcointrading.net/power-bi-for-crypto-data/\n        https://www.altcointrading.net/power-bi-for-crypto-data/\n        en\n        \n      \n    \n      \n        \n        \n        The last decade or so has seen crypto send ripples through industry after industry, accelerating in the last five.\n\nIt is true that in many cases, the disruption was short-lived and only meant to generate buzz. But not always: Crypto has helped to break ground, for instance, enabling contemporary African artists to have work auctioned at Christie’s of London for the first time in history.\n\nThe concept of digital ownership is a foundational feature not only of Bitcoin or NFT art, but also of projects like the Ethereum Name Service or ENS, which aims to replace the more centralized infrastructure that tends to underpin DNS.\n\nAfter thousands of alts, DeFi and NFTs, crypto’s killer app are still cross-border payments\n\nAll of these examples illustrate how key a part crypto can play in the realization of the potential that the Internet was supposed to promise; to connect the world in meaningful, distributed ways.\n\nBut IT idealists are not the only ones who have long envisioned the erosion of geography-bound regulation holding the world in place.\n\nOne of the long-posited core benefits of cryptocurrency is that widespread adoption of crypto as means of exchange could do away with cross-border transfer hitches. And the erosion of geographic boundaries is something that crypto is pushing in the online casino space, as well.\n\nCrypto casinos are exactly what they sound like: online casinos where cryptoassets like Bitcoin are used instead of fiat currency.\n\nThe space has moved fast. One piece on Cryptonews describes an ascent from the simple dice game Satoshidice to much slicker implementations, and recent reports claim that 150 crypto casinos are opening per year.\n\nSo what accounts for this popularity, and how are they different from traditional online casinos?\n\n\n  \n    Transparency\n\n    So long as players stick to reputable online casinos, they shouldn’t find it impossible to win.\n\n    Blockchain casinos score a bit better here. As Hackernoon explains, crypto casinos — usually living on Ethereum blockchain — have a pre-programmed payout rate that can be read in the open code.\n\n    And because the wagers all take place on-chain without an intermediary, they can be checked and verified too, which many hail as an advantage over standard online casinos.\n  \n  \n    Range of Games\n\n    Online entertainment as a whole is a huge and well-established industry. Consequently, your typical online casino has a wide variety of content. This includes different game types as well as themes. Case in point; Gala Bingo Slingo titles include Slingo Stampede and Slingo X Factor, two different themes around a unique genre. Elsewhere, the same provider has game shows, live casino games, poker and more. This is the typical offering.\n\n    But you may find a crypto casino doesn’t have the same depth. The fact is that despite its popularity, crypto gambling is still only one segment of the wider industry, and with fewer players, it makes sense not to have such an expansive selection of options at this time.\n\n    That may yet change, however - especially if crypto entertainment becomes more popular.\n  \n  \n    Anonymity and Crossing Borders\n\n    There are plenty reasons why someone might want to use an anonymous wallet at a casino rather than a bank account.\n\n    Some are shady. The reality is that there are legal restrictions in many countriesaround the world  that people try to circumvent. There will be plenty of wagers on the FIFA World Cup in Qatar, for instance, though none of them can be made from within the country itself.\n\n    Tough regulations came down on iGaming in the US during the George W. Bush administration, too, with slow state-by-state legalization during the last decade. If a player is used to legal wagers in Connecticut but moves just over the border to Rhode Island, it is understandable, albeit illegal, to try to continue.\n\n    Like it or not, crypto makes and opening for that. In this sense, to reasonable regulators, crypto could be making a case for iGaming in general to be legal across borders rather than pushing it underground, 1930s prohibition-style.\n\n    Then there are good reasons, too, though. Some people just don’t want casinos to appear on their bank statements, often for privacy or even, for instance, to avoid any unwanted impact on their credit rating. While there are startups that collect credit rating data on blockchain as well, pairing a BTC address with a real world identity is much more difficult in crypto than in a bank.\n  \n\n\nFinal words\n\nTo wrap it up, let’s admin that crypto casinos are evolving into a mainstay within the wider industry. BTC and ETH predominate because of their network effect and reputation, of course, but many crypto-first shops run on their own tokens. It remains to be seen which of these two models will be most popular in years to come.\n ]]>\n        \n        \n        Sat, 24 Sep 2022 21:52:00 +0000\n        https://www.altcointrading.net/crypto-casinos-why-makes-sense-to-use-crypto/\n        https://www.altcointrading.net/crypto-casinos-why-makes-sense-to-use-crypto/\n        en\n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n",

      title: "How to safely move Litecoin between SegWit P2SH (3) addresses and legacy (L) addresses",
      content: "Back in 2017, some time before Bitcoin, Litecoin also upgraded their network to get SegWit support. Segwit, or segregated witness, makes transactions more efficient and cheaper, and also enabled atomic swaps between LTC and BTC.\n\nThis newer format is called P2SH (pay-to-script-hash).\n\n\n  If you are here just for the P2SH vs legacy address converter, proceed to https://litecoin-project.github.io/p2sh-convert/\n\n\nDifference between P2SH and Legacy LTC address\n\n\n  Nested Segwit LTC address (P2SH): starts with M or more rarely3\n  Legacy LTC address: starts with L\n\n\nThe two Segwit formats (M and 3) are equivalent. Originally, the 3-addresses were implemented for Litecoin’s nested Segwit. This caused issues because Bitcoin also uses an address format that starts with 3. For that reason, with the next network upgrade, the Litecoin P2SH addresses were changed into a format that starts with M.\n\nHardware wallets and OG wallet apps got upgraded soon after the network upgrade. As a result, you will now often get Segwit-compatible addresses for LTC as the default.\n\nHowever, for crypto exchanges the situation is different.\n\n\n  Some exchanges haven’t upgraded and only allow LTC withdrawals to legacy addresses.\n  Some exchanges (mostly DEX and dApp platforms) on the other hand only allow withdrawal to P2SH addresses because, that’s the only way a contract-based dApp can reach the LTC blockchain.\n\n\nIf you want to learn more about SegWit, head over to the ATNET Glossary.\n\nHere’s just the practical info on how to move litecoins around without losing them.\n\nHow to withdraw Litecoin from Exchange to P2SH Address (Hardware wallets)\n\nYou will need a P2SH Litecoin address to withdraw LTC from non-custodial exchanges like LocalCryptos.\n\nIf you are using a hardware wallet like Ledger or Trezor, your default LTC addresses will be almost definitely P2SH, and they will start with the letter M.\n\nIf your exchange gives you an error that says an address starting with M is not a valid LTC address, you will still be able to withdraw into the P2SH address that starts with 3.\n\nLitecoin addresses that start with 3 are equivalent to that starting with M, so the coin will show up in the same wallet, in the same address. Using the 3-address is just like using an alias.\n\n\n  Copy your M-address where you want to receive the LTC\n  Go to https://litecoin-project.github.io/p2sh-convert/ which is a public converter script recommended by Trezor to use for this purpose.\n  Send a small amount of LTC to your 3-address and check that the transaction arrived well. There were reports of Uphold.com messing this up and sending bitcoins instead.\n  If the test transaction went well, withdraw the rest.\n\n\nHow to withdraw Litecoin to a legacy address (Wallet Apps)\n\nIn Trezor and Ledger wallets, you can still generate a new legacy account and get an L-address.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the Exodus.io wallet app - Exodus only supports L-addresses for Litecoin.\n\nOnce your LTC is transferred and confirmed, hardware wallets will send the LTC from the legacy account into the P2SH account. (This is not automatic, you have to do it manually.)\n\nWallet apps like Jaxx and Exodus won’t send LTC to a P2SH address, you will need to get an L-address too if you are moving Litecoin from there.\n",

      title: "How to safely generate IOTA seed and migrate from Light Wallet to Trinity",
      content: "Quick Intro to IOTA and Tangle\n\nIOTA is a transactional and data transfer layer aiming at the Internet of Things.\n\nIt uses a distributed ledger called Tangle which scales better than blockchain. The more Tangle gets used the more efficient it becomes.\n\nThe Tangle ledger is based on distributed technology called DAG (directed acyclic graph). Each transaction forms its own “block” and is essentially verified by itself.\n\nTo put your transaction through, your device has to verify two other randomly chosen older transactions in the network. This is done with a simplified version of proof-of-work. Thanks to this solution for network confirmations, transaction cost is essentially zero. (It also opens the ledger to new kinds of attacks though.)\n\nThat in turn makes IOTA ideal for automated transactions in the IoT.\n\nIn 2019, IOTA trading has spread widely from the initial two markets on Bitfinex and CoinSpot.\n\nHow to store IOTA: Light Wallet and Trinity\n\nIOTA Light Wallet\n\nThe official and until recently the most used IOTA wallet was simply a GUI for your seed, where the seed is not even generated for you - you need to do it yourself.\n\nThat was the IOTA Light Wallet, still available from the official iotaledger github for Windows, Mac and Linux - but not updated in about a year.\n\nIf you ever used the IOTA Light Wallet you will know about its perks - “Can’t connect to remote node”, “Can’t sync”, the notorious zero balance issue and more.\n\nIOTA Trinity Wallet &amp; Ledger Nano S\n\nThe IOTA team has recently released a new wallet called Trinity that is in public beta at the time of writing. You can import your old seeds into it and protect them with a password which is more user-friendly. I encourage you to move some of your IOTA there (obviously, there can still be bugs).\n\nThe Trinity wallet is also the software you will need to hold IOTA on your Ledger Nano S, which is newly an option too.\n\nHow to migrate from IOTA Light Wallet to IOTA Trinity\n\n\n\n\n  Download and install the Trinity wallet from the releases page on IOTA’s github: github.com/iotaledger…\n  Create a new default wallet: The Trinity wallet is a multi-seed vault protected by a master password. You cannot “recover” your Light Wallet address by directly importing old seed like you would do when changing Bitcoin wallets. You’ll first need to create a default wallet in the Trinity vault, set a master password and then you can start importing additional seeds into the vault.\n  Click the add ‘Add new account’ in the left sidebar of Trinity: This will lead you to the interface where you can insert your seed.\n  Submit your old seeds: Copy-pasting is disabled for security reasons. You get the option to drag and drop a text file that contains your seed but for me that did not work, Trinity kept claiming the file’s corrupt. If this happens to you just open the text file and re-type the seed into the dialog. It will work.\n  Check your balance: After this you should be able to see your correct balance right away.\n\n\n\n\nHow to Generate IOTA seed\n\nIOTA seed is a string of 81 characters consisting only of uppercase latin letters and 9’s (there has to be at least one ‘9’ in the seed).\n\nThe seed string can be absolutely anything, as long as it’s 81 characters of uppercase latin letters and 9s. There are websites that generate the seed for you but in this way you are depending on their good will of not snooping on you, so this way of seed generation shouldn’t be encouraged.\n\nAlso, don’t be tempted to use a line from your favorite song:\n\n\n  I wanted to create a short program to show that this type of password is also insecure. Using Python with a few simple libraries, I created this script that generates a password list based on a given artist. Discovering someone’s favorite band is pretty easy… that sort of thing is plastered all over social media, and it’s usually something people will provide when asked by anyone. (via privsec.blog, includes the python code)\n\n\nOn Linux and Mac, hands down the best option is to open up the terminal and generate a random string like this:\n\ncat /dev/urandom |LC_ALL=C tr -dc 'A-Z9' | fold -w 81 | head -n 1\n\nIf you want to store your seed on paper, simply write it down now and you are done here.\n\nIf you want to store your IOTA seed on a computer you need to encrypt it. The best way is to encrypt the seed right after its generation, without having had the plaintext seed on your laptop at all:\n\ncat /dev/urandom |LC_ALL=C tr -dc 'A-Z9' | fold -w 81 \\\n | head -n 1 | openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt -out paranoia.enc\n\n\nThe command above will ask you for password - choose something strong. You can verify the file is encrypted by trying cat paranoia.enc. If you want a different cipher check what’s available with openssl list-cipher-algorithms. Allegedly the 256bit AES is still what the US government uses to encrypt information at the Top Secret level. Salt (-salt) adds strength to the encryption and makes it harder to do a dictionary attack.\n\nDecrypting the file on Mac goes like this:\n\nopenssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -in paranoia.enc | pbcopy\n\nThe first part before the pipe is the decrypting, pbcopy is a command that will dump the seed into your clipboard so that the seed won’t get printed out into your terminal’s display. You should have pbcopy by default on Mac. When you open your IOTA wallet and press Cmd+V it will be the first time you are ever seeing your IOTA seed.\n\nThis way the seed will be decrypted without creating a file on the disk for it - it will only be in the memory for a short while. It is far from bulletproof but it is better than generating a plaintext file with the seed on your hard drive and then trying to securely remove it.\n\nThe above is also a better way rather than writing the string into a file and then encrypt it which brings up the problem with secure removal of files:\n\ncat /dev/urandom |LC_ALL=C tr -dc 'A-Z9' | fold -w 81 | head -n 1 &gt;&gt; testfilename\nopenssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt -in testfilename -out file.enc\n\n\nCopying into clipboard on a Linux laptop:\n\nOn Linux (with display) you will need the xclip package. To get to the clipboard available from CTRL+V do this:\n\nopenssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -in paranoia.enc | xclip -sel clip\n\nIOTA offline wallet (true cold storage)\n\nAs mentioned before, IOTA is now supported by Ledger Nano S devices. The community sometimes calls Ledger the ‘cold storage’ - nonetheless, hardware wallets are a black box, you don’t know what’s in the hardware or whether there are vulnerabilities in the code. If you are a somewhat confident command line user, I encourage you to take more charge of your crypto holdings.\n\nThe previous section about generating the IOTA seed can be upgraded into a cold storage solution if it’s done on an air-gapped laptop or a Raspberry Pi: a clean, secure device that is not connected to the internet and when it has ever been, it was to download packages from official repos and sync blockchains - not to watch hentai from dodgy servers with malware in ads.\n\nIOTA GUI wallet: Generating receiving address online\n\nYou do need an internet connection to install the IOTA wallet (the GUI) and to login and see your receiving address but the seed generation via command line doesn’t need internet at all. If you have a separate device for coins and go offline for the generation, then open your wallet and copy your address in the Receive tab and move that address only to your computer for normal daily use, and only connect to the internet on your storage computer to check balances when withdrawing, that’s reasonably safe.\n\nEven colder version - IOTA Paper Wallet: Generating IOTA receiving address offline\n\nThere is also this offline tool for IOTA paper wallet generation by /u/mothermole1 on Github. You’ll need an online computer that can run nodejs apps to download the zip from Github. After unzipping generate the offline app - for Linux and Mac:\n\ncd IOTA-Paper-Wallet\nrm out/*\nnpm install\nnpm run build\n\n\nNow for the work on your offline device:\n\n\n  Safely transfer the generated offline-build.zip from the out directory into your offline machine that has a display and a web browser.\n  With the offline app generation there was also a sha256 checksum generated into checksum.md into the root of your repo on your online computer. On your offline machine you should check the integrity of the transferred zip file now. On Linux, sha256sum offline-build.zip. If you are posh enough to have an offline Mac it goes shasum -a 256 offline-build.zip.\n  Unzip the offline build and enter the directory.\n  Open index.html in a web browser.\n  If you haven’t already, generate your encrypted seed and decrypt it into your clipboard now - as described above.\n  Paste your seed into the input field in the web app and click “Generate” to collect your receiving address or print your paper wallet.\n\n\n\n\nThe receiving address is public and it’s the only information that has to leave your offline device. You can use it to check your balance from an online machine via an address explorer. This way your storage device doesn’t need to connect to the internet until you want to send a transaction.\n\nMore technically: This is a third-party app that uses the IOTA JavaScript library’s getNewAddress method to generate the receiving address from a seed on an offline device. Here is the lib in the paper wallet app, here on IOTA’s Github - so that you can do a quickdiff.com. If you are paranoid about using an app the code of which you won’t read, there is a simplified tutorial version that doesn’t require node on https://github.com/domschiener/iota-address-generator, which is linked from the official basic tutorial on learn.iota.org.\n\nWhere to learn more on how to store IOTA\n\n\n  IOTA has a good and very active subreddit r/iota. The developers are on Reddit and hold AMAs regularly. Technical questions are welcome.\n  For traders, IOTAmarkets is also very lively.\n  The IOTA official blog lives at https://medium.com/iotatangle.\n  iota.cool is the IOTA address explorer.\n  There is a neat tangle visualizer at https://tangle.blox.pm\n\n\n\n\nThanks /u/2t6vFAdRMsRl and /u/MrStormLars for contributing good ideas.\n",

      title: "Wallet OPSEC: Sweeping private keys and Sweeping Addresses",
      content: "This post is about sweeping private keys in the Electrum wallet for Bitcoin. Usually people need to do that because they are trying to redeem their forked coins. If that’s you, feel free to jump to the relevant section.\n\n\n  If you just want to know how to redeem Bitcoin Cash (BCH), go here.\n  If you just want to know how to redeem Bitcoin Gold (BTG), go here.\n\n\nWhat is Sweeping?\n\nWhen you hear traders speak of sweeping, they could be referring to two different things.\n\nSweeping Dust\n\nSweeping dust, or address sweeping, is a way to collect your cryptocurrency spread around in multiple addresses within one wallet. In this case all the coins live under the same private key, they are just in different addresses.\n\nDust sweeping is a single low-fee transaction that will move all the cryptocurrency into one address.\n\nMore tech-oriented wallets like Electrum for Bitcoin let you sweep your coins.\n\nWhat is sweeping dust good for?\n\nForks (Slight Security Improvement)\n\nYou can make use of dust sweeping for your own security when you are preparing to split coins after a fork that generated a new coin.\n\nConsider this a preparatory step when a fork is announced - it doesn’t have to be live yet. It doesn’t even have to be certain. It is just organizing your coins so that you can act faster when you need it.\n\nIf you have swept your coins into a single address prior to the chain split, to redeem the forked coins you need to work only with the key belonging to the address that held coins before the split, not with the whole set of wallet keys.\n\nImporting only the private key to a single address is a slightly better way than importing the whole wallet seed – it is less confusing, less prone to human error, less messy.\n\nElectrum will still warn you that exposing a single private key (key to one address only) can still expose access to the whole wallet.\n\nSo before sweeping keys into forked coin clients you should still do the private key sweeping too, not just address (dust) sweeping.\n\nZero-Leverage Swing Trading\n\nIf you are a swing trader (a trader who likes to capture the larger market moves that span weeks or months), you can use sweeping to move your bitcoin into a single address if you are expecting your market entry trigger soon.\n\nThis way you won’t have to do that in a rush when you need to send the coins into your altcoin exchange to trade a ratio.\n\nAirdrops\n\nAnother instance where it comes handy is if you are linking an address for an airdrop that rewards holders of a different coin. If you have swept your coins you will need to link one address only.\n\nSo that is it for sweeping dust.\n\nSweeping Private Keys\n\nSweeping private keys is a different operation in that you are sending the cryptocurrency to a different private key.\n\nBy sweeping private keys you can send all address balances under the private key “A” to a single address that belongs to a private key “B”.\n\nKey sweeping is a single transaction by which you move coins from one private key to another private key. The difference is you are sweeping from key “A”, working from the wallet of key “B”.\n\nPrivate key sweeping will cost you a transaction fee, but the cost of the transaction will be lower than if you moved coins from all addresses separately.\n\nWhat is sweeping keys good for?\n\nForks\n\nAgain, you can make use of key sweeping for your own security when you are preparing to split coins after a fork that generated a new coin - but in a different way.\n\nIf you are claiming a fork, you are claiming forked coin that lives on a private key that is common for the original and the forked chain.\n\nIt is better for your security to move the original chain coin into a new private key after the fork happens but before you claim the forked coin.\n\nThe secure way to claim forked coins is to only do it when the relevant private key doesn’t have anything on the original chain anymore.\n\nWhat cryptocurrency wallets support sweeping?\n\nYou are looking for Electrum, the open source software wallet for Bitcoin.\n\nAs for hardware wallets - sweeping is currently not possible with Ledger Nano S - Ledger CTO u/btchip said in 2017 sweeping has been long on a to-do list and that technically it is not difficult to code. Nonetheless, it is still not implemented.\n\n\n\nTutorial: Dust Sweeping in Electrum (Sweep Addresses)\n\nSweep addresses into a single one if you are preparing for an airdrop or fork and want to have all your money in a single address.\n\nIt can also be a question of management - maybe you keep monthly track records. Sweep addresses when you are done collecting your records.\n\n\n  If you don’t have the app, download it from https://electrum.org/ and import your seed to get access to your wallet.\n  Go to the tab “Addresses”.\n  Select all the addresses you want to spend from. To select multiple addresses at once, hold the CTRL key on Windows or Linux, or the CMD on a Mac.\n  With all addresses selected, right click into the selection and go for “Spend from”.\n  The wallet will redirect you to the “Send” tab but you can click on “Receive” to move there: At this point you are sending coins to yourself, so you need your receiving address.\n  Copy your receiving address and go back to “Send”, where you paste it in the “Pay to”.\n  Go to the field where you set your fee and set it to the lowest value possible: You are sending money to yourself and you are not in a hurry so it doesn’t matter if it takes a day or two to confirm. But still make sure you’ve checked “Replaceable” – if something changes, you will be able to replace-by-fee, in other words to pay higher fee to get the transaction through faster.\n  That’s it, broadcast the transaction. Note that in your history this will only show as the fee expense because you are not sending money out.\n\n\nTutorial: Sweep private keys in Electrum\n\nSweep private keys into a newly created wallet if you are moving coins out of your old wallet to claim forked coins or airdropped coins by sharing your seed with a third party app.\n\nTo sweep private keys you need two different wallets under your control - the one from where you are sending (“A”) and the one where you are sending (“B”)\n\n\n  Wallet A: Export your private keys: Wallet &gt; Private Keys &gt; Export. (Copy the keys)\n  Wallet B: Sweep the keys: Wallet &gt; Private Keys &gt; Sweep. (Paste the copied keys)\n\n\nPreparing for a Bitcoin chain split with Electrum step by step\n\nPrior to the fork:\n\n\n  Do this a few days before the fork to avoid high fees.\n  You can always check current fee rates in Sat/byte at bitcoinfees.earn.com. Typically the fees will be lower during weekends.\n  Sweep your addresses that have some money in them into a single one within your wallet, as described above.\n  For convenience it is best to label the address that holds all the coins.\n\n\nAfter the (replay-protected) fork:\n\n\n  Move the coins to another wallet (wait for the transaction to confirm).\n  Install the forked coin wallet client, preferably on a virtual machine so that you can copy-paste but the two wallets are technically not on the same machine.\n  In Electrum, click “Wallet” &gt; “Private keys” &gt; “Export” and wait while the keys decrypt.\n  Copy the key for the address that held your coins pre-fork.\n  Open the forked coin client, such as Electron Cash for BCH, and sweep the key. It will always be in a similar place – something like “Main menu” &gt; “Wallet” &gt; “Private keys” &gt; “Sweep”\n  Paste the private key of the single address and sweep it.\n\n\nIs sweeping possible with other cryptocurrencies or only with Bitcoin?\n\nThere have been third party forks and so new versions of Electrum have been developed to support some altcoins as well but those are a different software.\n\nElectrum is not itself a multi-cryptocurrency wallet.\n\nSome of the altcoin forks don’t have much of the advanced functionalities of Electrum, they were stripped down to holding the altcoin only.\n\nIn Electrum Stratis, for instance, you cannot choose the addresses to spend from. You do however the option to sweep private keys from another client.\n\nGenerally high fees are not a problem with most cryptocurrencies other than BTC and sometimes ETH. The fees also generally get lower during the weekends when the network activity is lower.\n\nSafe splitting of coins after Bitcoin fork\n\n\n\nRedeeming Bitcoin Cash from BTC that were in Electrum\n\n\n  Install the BCH wallet\n\n\nThe official BCH wallet app can be downloaded and verified from https://electroncash.org/. There is Windows, Linux, Mac and Android app available. Anything on app stores is potentially dangerous, and Electron Cash is not meant to be fully trusted either.\n\nThe best way is to download the Android APK on your Android phone that doesn’t have another Bitcoin wallet on it. If you don’t have an Android, on Linux you can use a virtual machine with Android OS and on Mac or PC an Android emulator https://www.andyroid.net/.\n\n\n  Export your old Electrum private keys\n\n\nOld wallet: Wallet &gt; Private Keys &gt; Export\n\nIf you have swept addresses, you will only need the private key of the address that actually holds the BTC. You can copy it from the table Electrum generates.\n\n\n  Create a new Electrum wallet\n\n\nYou will need a new Electrum wallet where you move your BTC so that the private keys you will use for claiming the BCH won’t hold any BTC anymore.\n\nCreate a new Electrum wallet, encrypted one, with strong password. Write your seed on a piece of paper.\n\n\n  Sweep all BTC from your old Electrum wallet to the new one\n\n\nNew wallet: Wallet &gt; Private Keys &gt; Sweep\n\nWait for the transaction to have at least one confirmation. Do not proceed with this transaction unconfirmed!\n\n\n  Sweep the private keys into Electron Cash\n\n\nElectron Cash: New Wallet &gt; Import private key / I already have seed …\n\nIf you have swept addresses prior to the fork, you will only need the private key of the address that actually held the BTC during the chain split. You can copy it from the table old Electrum wallet generated.\n\nIf you didn’t sweep addresses before the fork, you need to import either all private keys or your seed phrase.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nRedeeming Bitcoin Gold from BTC that were in Electrum\n\nInstall the BTG wallet\n\nThere is no official BTG wallet app but there are several third party apps linked from  https://bitcoingold.org/downloads/. Anything else on app stores is potentially dangerous, it is a good practice not to put too much trust in the linked apps either.\n\nCoinomi would be the wallet of choice here because they have been around the longest time without any incidents. The best way is to download the Coinomi Android app from the Play Store on an Android phone that doesn’t have another Bitcoin wallet on it. If you don’t have an Android, on Linux you can use a virtual machine with Android OS and on Mac or PC an Android emulator https://www.andyroid.net/.\n\n\n  Export your old Electrum private keys\n\n\nOld wallet: Wallet &gt; Private Keys &gt; Export\n\nIf you have swept addresses, you will only need the private key of the address that actually holds the BTC. You can copy it from the table Electrum generates.\n\n\n  Create a new Electrum wallet\n\n\nYou will need a new Electrum wallet where you move your BTC so that the private keys you will use for claiming the BTG won’t hold any BTC anymore.\n\nCreate a new Electrum wallet, encrypted one, with strong password.

Do not proceed with this transaction unconfirmed!\n\n\n  Sweep the private keys into Coinomi\n\n\nCoinomi: Click the dots to access top right menu &gt; Sweep wallet\n\nIf you have swept addresses prior to the fork, you will only need the private key of the address that actually held the BTC when the chains were splitting. You can copy it from the table old Electrum wallet generated.\n\nIf you didn’t sweep addresses before the fork, you need to import either all private keys or your seed phrase.\n\n\n \n",

      title: "Virtual Machine Crypto Wallets: Should You Bother?",
      content: "Does it make sense to install your desktop crypto wallets on a virtual machine?\n\nOnly in some cases.\n\nDon’t Do It: Virtual Machine Bitcoin Wallet for Security\n\nIf you were looking for a way to set up a cold wallet for your bitcoin stash without having to invest in a hardware wallet or a spare device for tiered crypto storage management, here’s the bad news for you.\n\nPutting your bitcoin wallet into a virtual machine does not protect it from malicious software that gets into the computer that hosts it.\n\nIt is possible for a program on a computer to access contents of a virtual machine and it is also possible for a program on a virtual machine to access its host computer.\n\nThe virtual machine and its host computer are sharing the same resources, this link can be targeted and exploited.\n\nThe only advantage left for you to rely on here is the fact that very few people would resort to virtual machines for their crypto storage.\n\nHowever, this is not a good reason. To a malware developer, adding a VM-targeting method to their script is a matter of some lines of code that are written once and don’t cost extra to deploy on any number of victim machines.\n\nIn short: Don’t do this. Storing cryptocurrencies on a virtual machine is nowhere near cold storage.\n\nGet a Ledger hardware wallet, they run discount offers comparable with Black Friday several times each year.\n\nGo to Eternal Black Friday &gt;\n\nGo Ahead: Virtual Machine Crypto Wallet Due to Lack of Devices\n\nIf you are installing crypto wallets that you do not trust too much (such as with Bitcoin forks or crypto airdrops), technically you should do that on a separate device each time around.\n\nBut at the current rate you would probably need to carry around seventeen thousand Android phones.\n\nAirdrops &amp; Forks\n\nAt the same time, most airdrop and fork campaigns are not malicious, and it’s also not usually life changing amount of money. In this case, it is reasonable to use an Android in a virtual machine to store your altcoin wallets.\n\nAndroid app download to collect bounty\n\nAnother good use-case are bounty campaigns. Many ERC-20 tokenized apps will pay out bounties in TRX, BTC or ETH when you download their Android app. Typically, this is a launch promo and it’s done to boost their numbers.\n\nVirtual machine is a great way to do it because you will fulfill the condition but you won’t clutter your phone with garbage apps you will never use again (let’s face it).\n\nYou can have a virtual Android device on Mac, Windows and Linux laptops.\n\nTutorial: Get a Virtual Machine Crypto Wallet\n\nIn this post I’ll go with Android virtual machine on an Elementary OS (Linux).\n\nThere are only small differences for Mac and Windows.\n\nThe result will be a tablet screen inside of your laptop. It is controlled by touch which translates well into touchpad. If you use mouse, you need to click and hold.\n\nFirst things first, install VirtualBox.\n\nWhat you’ll need is the software for the virtualization.\n\nDownload VirtualBox from here - and an Android ISO. FYI, the Android ISO has about 800 MB.\n\n(Full-size version of the image opens on click)\n\n\n\nStep 1 Go to http://www.android-x86.org/download and get the ISO file of the latest Android. I am going with the 64 bit 7.1 here.\n\n\n\nStep 2 Now create the virtual machine on which you will use the Android: Open VirtualBox and click “New”.\n\n\n\nStep 3 Name the machine (doesn’t matter), say it is a Linux - Other Linux x86.\n\n\n\nStep 4 For the rest of the setup you can go with defaults. You will have VDI disk image with some amount of disk space and RAM allocated.\n\n\n\nSetting up Android phone in Virtualbox\n\nStep 1 You have created a virtual machine that is ready to have the Android installed on it. Now start it up by clicking on “Start”.\n\n\n\nStep 2 You will be asked to select a startup disk. Select the Android ISO you downloaded. This will take you to the installation.\n\n\n\nStep 3 Create a new partition - select “New”, press enter.\n\n\n\nStep 4 Press enter while on bootable and navigate to “Write”, enter. Confirm by typing in “yes”, enter.\n\nWhen it’s done you’ll have an sda1 partition, go to “Quit”, enter.\n\n\n\nStep 5 The installer will take you to dialog to format the partition - select sda1, enter.\n\nSelect ext4 and format the disk.\n\nChoose YES from now on - you DO really want to format, you DO want GRUB and you DO want that whatever directory writeable.\n\n\n\nStep 6 You are almost done.\n\n\n\nBefore you reboot the machine to launch your fake Android phone, unmount the ISO. If you don’t, the machine will keep attempting to reinstall Android.\n\nSo, go to Virtualbox menu and open Devices &gt; Optical Drives to unselect the ISO.\n\nCreate a Virtual Machine Crypto Wallet\n\nStep 1 Restart the virtual machine device. This will take you to the Android setup. It’s exactly the same thing as you do when you buy a new phone.\n\n\n\nStep 2 Set up the device as a new device with Google account. – You need a Google account to get access to the Play Store where the crypto wallet apps are.\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3 The last step is to launch the Play Store. Go ahead and look up the crypto wallet you want to use.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom here it’s all like on a regular phone: Create a new wallet, backup your seed on a piece of paper, start using it…\n\n\n\nAnd that is it.\n\nWhat cryptocurrecies is this solution suitable for?\n\nAny cryptocurrency that has an Android wallet on the official Google Play store.\n\nAndroids are hugely popular pretty much everywhere other than the US, so most cryptos offer an Android wallet.\n\nJust don’t install anything sketchy. Remember, malware can escape from the virtual machine into your host machine too.\n\nAvailable Android hot wallets and multicoin wallets from the Play Store:\n\n\n  Jaxx for Android - huge amount of altcoins, list here\n  Coinomi for Android - huge amount of altcoins, list here\n\n\nSingle coin wallets from the Play Store:\n\n\n  Android Electrum for Bitcoin\n  Android BCH ElectronCash\n  Android Stratis\n  Android IOTA mobile wallet in beta\n  Android ETH Lunary wallet\n  Android Dash wallet\n  Android NEO app\n  Android Byteball client\n  Android QTUM wallet\n  Android LTC Loafwallet\n  …\n\n",

      title: "How to avoid re-using an email while keeping a single inbox only (Phishing Protection)",
      content: "One thing we are probably not going to stop seeing anytime soon in the crypto space is phishing.\n\nOnce it becomes public knowledge an email address belongs to someone who owns cryptocurrencies, hackers will naturally try to get into the crypto trading platform accounts and web wallet associated with that email.\n\nThen there is the fun stuff on top of everything, such as Ledger wallet’s customer database getting breached.\n\nYou are making this fact a public knowledge every time you sign up for an airdrop, bounty or even a crypto-related mailing list.\n\nWhile MFA on exchanges is always a must, there is a fairly easy way to avoid reusing email addresses so that you always know where your address leaked from even before it appears on haveibeenpwned.com.\n\nTo do that you will need to get your own domain name.\n\nThe Idea\n\nYour goal is to be able to invent any random email address as you go and have it deliver emails into your usual mailbox.\n\nObviously you cannot set up a new mailbox each time you want to sign up somewhere, nobody is going to do that.\n\nIf you own a domain name though, you can use a so-called catch-all function to receive emails to any email address under that domain and have them delivered into the same mailbox.\n\nIf you also need to send an email out of the receiving addresses, you will need email aliases - mostly that will not be necessary though.\n\nThe email provider for catchall addresses\n\nRemember, the mailbox itself should be properly secured with MFA as well.\n\nTutanota\n\nAs the secure email client of choice I will recommend Tutanota. You will not be able to create this setup with their free account, but the premium version costs only 12 EUR per year.\n\nWith the default paid plan you get 5 different email addresses to use but they also have special extension packages to allow for more of them, currently up to 100. Tutanota has a web interface and smartphone apps, offers 2FA with Google Auth or Authy and stores all emails encrypted.\n\nProtonmail\n\nProtonmail is all in all a similar service to Tutanota and also offers custom domain support as a premium option, but the catch-all function is far more expensive than with Tutanota.\n\nWith Protonmail you can pay in Bitcoin, Tutanota still does not support cryptocurrency payments in 2022.\n\nAlternatively, you will be able to achieve this kind of solution for free with Yandex mailbox. It’s a paid feature with Google (GSuite).\n\nHow To Setup The Catch-All Mailbox\n\n\n\n\n  Pick a domain name for your email - winningbig.com or wenmoonsir.com, sadly lambomail.com is already taken. The domain should ideally be brand new as in never used before. If it was used for spam in the past, emails from there will get blocked and sent to spam too often. You can find out about previous owners of a domain in its Whois History.\n  The registrars that are easiest to use will be either Dynadot or Namecheap - Dynadot lets you pay in Paypal, Namecheap supports Bitcoin payments.\n  Get your premium email account with Tutanota or Protonmail, or dive into the documentation for Yandex.\n  Head to your domain’s DNS section add the DNS entries to direct emails for handles at this domain to your mailbox - for Tutanota it will be MX mail.tutanota.de and TXT v=spf1 include:spf.tutanota.de -all as seen here in their knowledge base. Protonmail’s how to is here for the basics and here for the anti-spoofing settings.\n  Check your domain’s DNS settings for emails at http://mxtoolbox.com couple of times until you see your entries there. The change is not instant.\n  Once the DNS change is confirmed, link the domain name to your email account. In Tutanota you will find it at Settings &gt; Extensions &gt; Custom domain in the old clients or at Settings &gt; Global settings &gt; Custom email domains in the new interface. The first field is for the domain name you are linking - say, lambomail.com - the second field is for your catch-all address. For that, use the default email address that you signed up with - say, porquenolosdos@tutanota.com.\n  If you did your DNS right you should be able to confirm it and be all set to receive any emails for your custom domain name. It won’t let you finish the linking until the DNS changes are done and confirmed.\n  If you want to set up the address for sending out, in Tutanota you can now head over to Settings &gt; User Management &gt; Email aliases. Add any specific address you need such as b1tf1n3xuser@lambomail.com and activate it. Tutanota will start giving you the option to send out emails from there. You can always discard the address or replace it with another, and then bring it back only for when you need to send an email out of there. As long as you have the catch-all address you will receive emails to any address under your domain name, no matter if has an alias or not.\n\n\nHow To Use Catch-All Mailbox The Secure Way\n\nWhen you are signing up at ANY third party place, use a single-use address from your domain.\n\n\n  Let’s say you are about to do a bounty at superdupercoin.com.\n  Go sign up to the bounty and use a catch-all address superdupercoin@lambomail.com\n  Your email confirmation will still come to your usual mailbox but your exchange accounts are safe because you are not using this address there.\n  ??\n  Some 6 months later, your airdrop shitcoin probably doesn’t exist anymore and you start receiving spam or phishing emails to address superdupercoin@lambomail.com. (Yeah, that’s what usually happens.)\n\n",

      title: "Beginner’s Guide On How To Use Bitcoin ATM",
      content: "How did you first hear about bitcoin?\n\nMaybe you saw a story on the news and did some research.\n\nPerhaps a friend or family member told you about it, and you were intrigued.\n\nYou might have even seen a bitcoin ATM in your local mall or grocery store and decided to check it out.\n\nExciting, isn’t it? What a time to be alive, magic internet money and all that.\n\nHowever, the steps involved in making your first purchase can appear to be daunting.\n\nIn this blog post, we will explain the basics of bitcoin ATMs and kiosks and help you find your nearest Bitcoin ATM kiosk.\n\nAlso learn how Bitcoin transactions work.\n\nWhat is a Bitcoin ATM?\n\nBitcoin ATMs and kiosks are much like the standard ATMs you see every day.\n\nWhen you deposit cash into a traditional ATM, you enter your debit card first to access your account. Once you have finished depositing money into the ATM (minus any transaction fees) it’s credited into your bank account.\n\n\n\nBenefits Of Using Bitcoin ATM\n\nYou can also take advantage of the conveniences of using a Bitcoin ATM. Here are some of the benefits you can enjoy:\n\n\n  \n    Fast and Convenient\n\n    A Bitcoin ATM can complete cryptocurrency trading transactions in just a few minutes. You can buy Bitcoins by simply inserting cash into the machine. Selling is also possible without waiting for several days to encash coins. Bitcoin ATM users just need to carefully follow the steps displayed on the screen.\n\n    Plus, you don’t have to create an online wallet, use a public key, or signup for a user account to buy and sell Bitcoins on ATMs, making each transaction a breeze.\n  \n  \n    Secure\n\n    Bitcoin ATMs are designed and built around anonymity and security. Similar to a traditional ATM, they also require passwords, 2-factor authentication and other identity verification methods to complete transactions. There are also no third parties involved as it goes directly to the blockchain.\n\n    Some Bitcoin ATMs can also generate unique QR codes when a new transaction is made, giving you the assurance that your crypto asset is safe and secure.\n\n    In addition, Bitcoin transactions in online platforms have a high risk of scams or hacking. With a Bitcoin ATM, traders can buy and sell safely right from their wallets. You’ll have greater control over your funds.  You also don’t have to rely on custodians, so you retain complete Bitcoin ownership.\n  \n  \n    Availability of ATM Machines\n\n    The number of Bitcoin ATMs are currently increasing. These ATMs are already available and accessible in key cities worldwide, so you can basically complete transactions almost anywhere.\n  \n\n\nUsing the Bitcoin ATM\n\nBitcoin ATMs work almost the same way as fiat ATMs, with a few simple differences.\n\n\n  Instead of a debit card, you typically scan or show your government-issued ID or enter your phone number, so the ATM or kiosk can verify where to send the bitcoin.\n  Much like with a deposit ATM, you will insert cash bills into the machine, but instead of depositing U.S dollars, it automatically exchanges that money for the equivalent amount of bitcoin.\n\n\nReceiving your bitcoins\n\nWhen using a bitcoin ATM, you will receive a deposit of bitcoin directly into your digital wallet.\n\nWhen you are using a Bitcoin kiosk, you receive a redemption code on your receipt that you must enter online later to receive your bitcoin.\n\nSelling bitcoins via a Bitcoin ATM\n\nSome Bitcoin ATMs also offer two-way functionality which allows for you to do the same transaction in reverse: Withdraw bitcoin that is immediately exchanged into US dollars that are then dispensed from that ATM.\n\nWhen in doubt, it pays off checking out expert resources in bitcoin trading. You reduce the risks of errors and get the best value for your investment by doing so.\n\nHow Do I Use A Bitcoin ATM?\n\nThe screen itself typically provides a step-by-step tutorial.\n\nIn the video below, we will show you an example transaction using a Coinstar kiosk powered by Coinme.\n\n\n  When you approach the kiosk, you simple hit get started and select the option that says Buy Bitcoin.\n  After you review the brief terms and conditions, you are directed to enter your phone number. This part of the process ensures your security and links your phone number to the bitcoin purchase so no one else can gain access to your bitcoin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Next you will get to see the exchange rate for your bitcoin purchase.\n  Finally, nou can then enter your dollar bills into the bill acceptor. Typically this is down and to the right of the screen.\n  Once you have inserted all your bills, you can verify the amount entered and hit the buy bitcoin button on the lower, right-hand side of the screen.\n\n\nAfter you have finished your purchase, the kiosk will print out your receipt. This is important to keep safe and secure, as it does include your bitcoin redemption code.\n\nAs we mentioned above, you will need to visit coinme.com/redeem and enter that code along with your phone number to have your bitcoin deposited into your digital wallet.\n\nWhat Do I Do After the Kiosk Purchase?\n\nAfter you have finished purchasing your bitcoin, the process of redeeming the voucher is simple as well. Once you have your receipt, you can visit coinme.com/redeem and begin the redemption process. There will be a step-by-step guide.\n\nAre Bitcoin ATMs Safe?\n\nWhile this does vary based on the company operating the machine, customer safety is a primary area of focus for all decent providers.\n\nA good ATM provider should…\n\n\n  Have a dedicated support team that you can call.\n  Have a team of in-house engineers and maintainers.\n  Pay attention to the kiosk location - ATMs and kiosks should be in well-lit, public spaces like shopping malls, providing a safe and secure user experience for everyone\n\n\nIn case you saw a Bitcoin ATM in your local mall, you should be able to find a phone number or other contact information somewhere on the booth to inquire about the points above.\n\nOnce you confirm the provider can be trusted, you can go make the purchase - ideally at a time of the day when the location will be moderately busy.\n\nArticle was edited and republished with permission.

      title: "How to safely use bitcoin for payments",
      content: "Even in 2020, when we talk about cryptocurrencies and bitcoin, some people still react as if it’s a dangerous alien from Mars. That also means that cryptocurrencies are probably still hostages away from becoming the mainstream currency.\n\nBitcoin payments can still make your life easier, though.\n\nThe problem of getting started\n\nCryptocurrency have been off-stream since their inception. It is still difficult for many to grasp the use of bitcoin as a means of payment, not just for speculation. But since you are here, that is likely not your problem.\n\nAlso, a lot of crypto software doesn’t feel safe, and indeed there have been hacks. In this article we’ll point you to tools and resources to learn how to pay with bitcoin safely.\n\nBitcoin for digital purchase\n\nBitcoin does facilitate the purpose of online money. In the tech sector, you can already quite commonly buy products or get services from the internet by paying with Bitcoin. Services like VPN, cloud hosting or sysadmin tools will these days typically list bitcoin payments alongside the more common ways to pay, such as Paypal or credit card.\n\nIn some cases, paying in crypto will come cheaper than paying directly the current USD price.\n\nAnother advantage that you get as a customer is your full control over billing cycles. Paying with a credit card or Paypal, service providers will typically require you to authorize regular payments. If you subscribe to a service for one year, you stop using it and forget about it, the next year you will still be charged automatically.\n\nWith cryptocurrencies, you as the private key owner need to manually sign each single transaction. Recurrent billing is therefore not possible. A vendor might send you an email with an invoice, but you can simply choose not to send another bitcoin payment. In time your service will be cancelled and if you didn’t do full KYC, it wouldn’t even be possible to fine you for not paying.\n\nIt is therefore not surprising that in one recent study, it has been seen that 13% of some 22000 have used bitcoins for payment and this number is a combined sample from 22 countries in the world. The craziest factor is that in the countries where the bitcoin is banned, there the spread of bitcoin is even more in the undergrounds.\n\nStoring your bitcoin for when you need to pay\n\nBitcoin has been considered a highly speculative asset in the past 10 years.\n\nThe blame rises partly on the media that portrays the bitcoins as a means of payment strictly used for nefarious purposes. There is also an inherent conservative mistrust in Bitcoin, because it needs no centralized authority, unlike state-backed currencies.\n\nSince Bitcoin is essentially a piece of software, the danger of hacking or a critical bug is relevant here, too. Millions of people are targeted to be hacked on a daily basis and many of these attempts are successful. This very reasonable fear of hacking also makes many stay away from crypto.\n\nThe answer here is to learn how to keep the bitcoins and cryptocurrencies safe.\n\nFirst off, you will need a cryptocurrency wallet.\n\nThen, a few recommendations from our crypto opsec section: You will need to keep your phone or laptop safe from malware if you have a crypto wallet on it, better yet you would have a separate device for these purposes. And you should have basic awareness of how you are being targeted by cyber criminals.\n\n\n  The 101 of securing your Mac and iPhone\n  Tiered device management for hot and cold cryptocurrency wallets\n  Main security threats for crypto hodlers in 2020\n\n\nManaging your value of transaction\n\nAnother common worrying factor would be the volatility of bitcoin. To people who are not traders, the dollar value of bitcoin drops and rises unnaturally without any warning.\n\nThe volatility for during the transaction is not such a big problem, though.\n\nConsider that a bank transaction would require more time, plus some banks do not allow certain transactions because of international policies.\n\nA good example is buying a property abroad - if you can find counterparty who accepts crypto payments, the overall process is even now already cheaper and less cumbersome than dealing with large fiat wires between countries.\n\nThrough bitcoin you can transfer any amount of money for lower fee and your transaction will always be cleared within 10 minutes.\n\nThe main problem to people seems to be managing the money spent as the Bitcoin price evolves in the long run. There are too many stories of people spending what would now be four of five figures USD to buy a geeky t-shirt with bitcoin.\n\nThe solution here, for someone who plans to make purchases with crypto, consists of two parts:\n\n\n  Loosely follow the bitcoin price relative to your country’s fiat currency, and buy the dips. Store your crypto securely and keep track about your average purchase price per bitcoin.\n  For larger purchases, you can wait until the market price of bitcoin will get over your purchase price. That way you will essentially exit the market in profit. For small purchases, you can simply buy back the amount you spent. In a bull market this will rise your average base price per coin, but less so than just spending without buying back.\n\n\nBitcoin as a Mainstream Mode of Payment\n\nThere are both advantages and disadvantages of paying through bitcoin.\n\nOne of the best things about bitcoin is that you do not have to wait over the weekend for your payment to clear. You can get or transfer your money at midnight or in holidays or in weekends.\n\nOne of the challenges is the security aspect and management of your crypto wallets.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt’s not enough to understood the value and the importance of bitcoins and cryptocurrencies. To start using bitcoin for payment it’s also necessary to know how to securely manage its storage. That is certainly a drawback when it comes to mass adoption, however with the rapid digitalization of trade and communication it should be less of a hurdle over time.\n",

      title: "Beginner’s guide on How to buy Ethereum (ETH)",
      content: "Beginner’s guide to buying Ethereum (ETH)\n\nThe second biggest cryptocurrency in the world is Ethereum, or actually Ether (ETH). Ethereum is the blockchain that have significantly changed the way blockchain works and its potential.\n\nBitcoin gave us store of value and means of payment independent on the government.\n\nWith Ethereum we have seen blockchain technology grow smarter and evolve to fit into the new advancements of technologies that we live with.\n\nWith smart contracts and a platform to build out new decentralised products and services Ethereum serves as hub in an ever-growing ecosystem.\n\nWith that in mind there is a ever-growing interest in Ethereum and its cryptocurrency Ether. Here in this guide I wanted to provide you with clear how-to-guide for buying Ethereum for the first time.\n\nIt is perfect for any beginners that have little to no past experience buying cryptocurrencies or investing at all.\n\nThere are platforms around the world that allow people to invest in certificates that follows the price of an asset, Ethereum and Bitcoin and others are available there. And that’s an option for beginners to start off with. But I am in this guide talking about actually buying the cryptocurrency ETH, and then storing it in a safe cryptocurrency wallet.\n\nThe overall steps that I recommend that you go through to buy and store ETH successfully are:\n\n\n  Find a reliable wallet\n  Next find an exchange or site to buy ETH from\n  Send your ETHs to the wallet you previously created\n\n\nThat’s it! It isn’t more complicated than that. And I will walk you through each step to make it even easier.\n\nLet’s start with the first step, finding a good wallet for ETH.\n\n\n\nPart 1 - Finding a good ETH Wallet\n\nYou could at some cryptocurrency exchanges store your ETHs at the exchange. And I do understand that could be seen as easier, but I recommend that you don’t. Instead get your ETH wallet.\n\nThis way you control your own funds, and you also avoid the risk of hacks and thefts that often happen to exchanges.\n\nThere are free web, desktop and mobile wallets for ETH. And then you have hardware devices. These you pay for, but they are the most secure types of wallets. I own a couple myself and I store a majority of my holdings there.\n\nI do recommend you looking into buying one, there are Ledger, Trezor and Keepkey devices.\n\nSome free and easy to start with ETH wallets are:\n\n\n  MyEtherWallet\n  Metamask\n  Exodus wallet\n\n\nTo get a wallet with any of the options just go to the site and create a new wallet. After that you need to write down your private keys, passphrase or seeds (secret codes) to your wallet. This is very important that you do this.\n\nDon’t forget!\n\n\n\nPart 2 - Buy ETH at an exchange/broker site\n\nNow that you have your own wallet you can move onto the next step. To buy ETH!\n\nHere I will list a few beginner-friendly options for you. It doesn’t really matter too much which one you want to go for. I wanted to add a few different options for usefulness.\n\nTo buy ETH you either have to buy it with:\n\n\n  Fiat money (USD, EUR, GBP, etc) - you then buy with your credit or debit card, or via a bank transfer or another payment method such as PayPal\n  You trade some other cryptocurrency like BTC for ETH - but I will in this guide focus on buying with fiat money as I am assuming you don’t own any BTC or another cryptocurrency\n\n\nSo to to buy ETH with your fiat money you need to find a site where this is possible. Based on my own experience I can recommend you three different options.\n\n\n  Coinbase\n  Kraken\n\n\nThese all have fiat-gateways, that’s often how it’s called in crypto-lingo. It means you can buy cryptocurrencies with fiat money.\n\nHere’s how to buy ETH at Coinbase\n\n\n\nStep 1 - Register an account\n\nFirst thing is to head over to Coinbase and create your own account.\n\nStep 2 - Add card or bank account\n\nNext thing is to add your card or bank account in your settings page.\n\nStep 3 - Make payment\n\nIf you want to buy with your card then you can buy ETH immediately. If with a bank transfer then you have to wait until the transfer have been completed and then buy ETH at Coinbase. The latter can take up to 1-4 days. But it’s much cheaper.\n\nHere’s how to buy ETH at Kraken\n\n\n\nStep 1 - Register an account\n\nFirst thing is to head over to Kraken and create your own account.\n\nStep 2 - Add bank account\n\nNext thing is to add your bank account. You will need to complete KYC checks (identity verification).\n\nStep 3 - Make the bank transfer\n\nWhen that’s done you can now make the bank transfer (USD or EUR).\n\nStep 4 - Buy ETH\n\nNow with the transfer complete you can buy ETH with either USD or EUR from your deposited funds\n\nThat’s how you buy ETH at Coinbase and Kraken.\n\nPart 3 - Send ETH to you wallet\n\nThe last part of this guide which I recommend, but is not a must is to send your ETHs to your wallet that you created in the first part.\n\nTo do this you have to go back to the wallet you created, find your ETH address\n\n\n\nAll Ether and Ethereum-based token addresses starts with 0x. And then it is a long alphanumerical mix of letters and numbers.\n\nCopy that address.\n\nThen go to Kraken or Coinbase, withdraw your ETHs and paste the address in. Make the transfer and then wait for it to go through. It can take from 30 minutes to 2 hours.\n\nFinal words\n\nThat is the end of this guide to buying ETH. I wanted to keep it short but with clear step by step information. I think if you follow this guide then buying ETH will be easy for most people. Even with little computer or investment experience.\n\nDon’t forget to keep a safe backup of your wallet keys!\n",

      title: "How to generate P2SH addresses in Bitcoin Electrum wallet",
      content: "This is a tutorial to help you generate P2SH bitcoin addresses to withdraw bitcoin from non-custodial apps like LocalCryptos.\n\nIf you are a P2P or DEX crypto trader, you probably know that to receive BTC from a decentralized app, you need to use a SegWit bitcoin address.\n\n\n  If you want to learn more about SegWit, head over to the ATNET Glossary.\n\n\nSegwit addresses are not all the same\n\nYou can easily get a SegWit bitcoin wallet on your phone with the Exodus app, on your laptop with Electrum if you are old-school or on any device with Ledger wallet.\n\nHowever, in 2020, any regularly updated bitcoin wallet app will prefer bech32 addresses. Bech32 addresses start with bc1.\n\nThe problem is that some non-custodial exchanges will only let you withdraw into a bitcoin address that starts with 3. Bitcoin SegWit addresses starting with 3 are called P2SH addresses (pay-to-script-hash).\n\nElectrum lets you generate P2SH address set from bitcoin seed\n\nGood news is you can generate a set of P2SH bitcoin addresses from your seedphrase in Electrum wallet. It is easy to do, but you need to know how to do it - the Electrum wallet provides no walkthrough for it.\n\nIf you worry about messing up your wallet, generate a new seedphrase first. It will work just the same.\n\nStep-by-step: Generate P2SH addresses in Bitcoin Electrum\n\nThis method works on a laptop with any operating system. The steps are always the same.\n\nBefore you start typing your seed anywhere, check with https://electrum.org/#download that you have the latest version of the wallet.\n\nStep 1: Get your seedphrase, or generate a new one.\n\nIf you don’t want to work with the seedphrase of a wallet you are currently using, that’s fine. Just start creating a new wallet up to the step where you get the seedphrase.\n\nWrite the seed down and close the Electrum dialog where you were creating the new wallet.\n\n\n\nStep 2: Start a wallet restoration process.\n\nOpen the Electrum wallet and in the File menu, select “New/Restore”.\n\nSelect you want “Standard wallet” and in the next step that you “Already have a seed”.\n\nStep 3: Type down your seedphrase and go to the advanced options.\n\nBelow the box into which you have to type in your seedphrase, you should see a button for extra “Options”. Click that, select bip39 and ignore the warning that will be generated for you then.\n\n\n\nStep 4: Select derivation path “p2sh-segwit”.\n\nThe derivation path of “p2sh-segwit” should be one of the options after typing in the seed. You can double check the derivation string below the options. It should contain the number 49 because your selection is based on BIP49. Don’t change anything in there.\n\nStep 5: Create the wallet.\n\nYour wallet should now be ready to use. Check your addresses to see that they all start with a 3.\n\n\n",

      title: "How To Choose Your Cryptocurrency Strategy",
      content: "Trading digital currencies is becoming an increasingly popular way of generating additional income.\n\nThis is primarily due to large potential returns that can be achieved if you know what you are doing, as well as the low barrier to entry to begin trading cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe high volatility of digital currencies when compared to traditional assets is what makes the unusually high returns possible. However, it can also result in large losses.\n\nThat is why it is important to always have a trading strategy in place.\n\nIn this guide, I will walk you through some of the basic crypto strategies that you can use even as a novice traders.\n\nArbitrage\n\n\n  This strategy is for you, if you prefer short-term trading.\n\n\nOne of the popular short-term trading strategies is arbitrage trading.\n\nThe strategy is simple and takes advantage of the price discrepancies that typically exist between cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nFor example, a trader is able to buy bitcoin on Coinbase, send it to Binance and sell it for a higher price. This small variation in the price is what traders are able to take advantage of and is the key idea behind arbitrage trading.\n\nTo illustrate further, consider that Amy buys one bitcoin on Coinbase which is currently trading at $10,000. The price of one bitcoin is currently $10,100 on Binance. In order to take advantage of this, Amy sends her bitcoin from Coinbase to Binance and sells it for the higher price. The risk Amy takes is that the bitcoin price on Binance might change before she is able to sell.\n\nThere are techniques to minimize this risk, such as leaving money on both exchanges to eliminate the need of the transfer. You can also look for more stable arbitrage opportunities between mainstream exchanges and smaller local platforms such as those based in Australia, as long as they are open to international customers.\n\nSwing Trading\n\n\n  This strategy is for you, if you prefer long-term trading.\n\n\nSwing trading attempts to take advantage of the volatility that is rampant in the crypto space.\n\nThe idea behind swing trading is to capture the price movement of a cryptocurrency in a particular direction.\n\nWith swing trading, you are really trying to get into a position at the exact point a reversal in price occurs. This method of trading is usually most effective using automatic tools such as crypto bots (e.g. Binance bots) and crypto signals (e.g. Binance signals).\n\nThe key for being a successful swing trader is to use these tools to help you identify when the price will reverse and will move up or down for an extended period of time.\n\nFundamental Analysis\n\n\n  This strategy is for you, if you prefer investment rather than trading.\n\n\nWhilst not exactly a trading strategy, fundamental analysis must be used by any serious trader attempting to extract a profit from the crypto market. The legacy market counterpart of crypto fundamental analysis would be stock picking.\n\nThe key to this method of investing is to find cryptocurrencies that are undervalued and buying them with the expectation of a price increase in order to make a profit.\n\nThis concept has been borrowed from stock trading which uses metrics such as Price to Earnings Ratio and Earnings Per Share Ratio to help value a stock. However, for the crypto markets, these metrics differ.\n\nThe most important cryptocurrency value metrics are network activity statistics, transaction counts, active wallet addresses and competence of the development team behind the cryptocurrency and the size of the market it is disrupting.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo conclude, these have been some of the top strategies on how to approach cryptocurrency investing or trading. These three are being used right now to generate attractive returns by traders and investors in the crypto space.\n\nIt is critical to find a strategy and style that fits your goals as this will be important in determining how successful you are trading crypto.\n",

      content: "This article is about PGP signatures, used to verify you downloaded a genuine copy of a software. For a guide on how to sign or verify a message in Electrum wallet, go here.\n\nIn this guide we are going to look at why you should learn how to verify GPG signatures and what is the difference between GPG signatures vs checksum verification.\n\nIn the last section of this article, there is a step-by-step guide on how to verify GPG signatures on Mac or Linux. It uses Electrum wallet as an example.\n\nChecksum vs GPG Signature\n\nGPG Signatures: Why are digital signatures important\n\nGPG signature is a digital signature that can be made by someone who owns a private GPG key.\n\nA GPG signature is then a proof that the files you downloaded have been signed by the owner of the GPG key.\n\nVwerifying GPG signatures will enhance your security. If you do that, you are making sure the software you’re downloading was put up online by the organisation tied to a GPG key.\n\nTypically, developers do not change their GPG key often and they store it safely - just like you store your crypto wallet seed phrases.\n\nIf a hacker gains access to a website that provides crypto wallets, they can replace the installer files but they will not be able to recreate the GPG signature. When you download those files, your GPG verification will fail and you will know that you muat not install that software.\n\nLearn how to verify GPG signatures here:\n\n\n  Step-by-step guide how to verify GPG signatures on Mac, using Electrum wallet as an example.\n\n\nChecksum is not a security feature\n\nIf you download open source software, you may have noticed that the developer sometimes provides a checksum alongside the installer files.\n\nThis is a common practice in software development especially if the installer file you have to download is a large file. You will also get a checksum for images used for virtual machines.\n\n\n  BTW: Installing shitcoin wallets in a virtual machine is not a good security practice.\n\n\nChecksum is a hash of file. You can take a 2GB file, quickly run a hashing function on it and the output will always be just a short string, no matter how big the file is.\n\nIf you download a large file and the hash the developer provided with it, you can then run a hashing function on the big file yourself. If its result matches the hash provided by the developer, you know that the download succeeded and the big file is not corrupted. And that’s all you should use it for.\n\n\n\nChecksum verification is not a security practice. If an attacker gets access to a download page and replaces a download file, they will also replace its checksum.\n\n\n\nStep by step guide by example\nVerify Electrum wallet GPG signature on Mac and Linux\n\nWe are going to walk you through the GPG signature verification on the example of Electrum, a popular OG bitcoin wallet.\n\nYou will need to use command line for this, but all the commands are listed and explained below.\n\n\n\nScammer Alert: Always download Electrum from the official downloads page, electrum.org/#download. Electrum provides installers for all common operating systems, along with their GPG signatures.\n\nSignature Verification Step by step\n\n\n  Download Electrum from the official website, electrum.org. You will need both the installer and the GPG signature file.\n  Open your Terminal to install the package that can verify GPG signatures.\n On Mac that will be brew install gnupg, on Linux apt install gnupg. This is really the fastest, easiest and safest way.\n  Look up GPG keys tied up with the domain electrum.org\n You do that like this: gpg --locate-keys electrum.org. There should only be a single answer.\n The true Electrum GPG has been published in 2011, which you should see in the pub line of the output.\n  \n  Save this key to your computer. The key_id is a code-like string just below the date of publishing. It will start with something like 66AB….\n gpg --output ~/btc.keyring --export &lt;key_id&gt;\n You now have a new file at ~/btc.keyring.\n  Change to the folder where you have your Electrum installer.\n You’ve also got its GPG signature file there. That’s the file that ends with .asc.\n  Verify that they are matching the Electrum GPG key you downloaded.\n gpgv --keyring ~/btc.keyring ./&lt;electrum-installer&gt;.asc ./&lt;electrum-installer&gt;\n The output should say “Good signature”.\n \n\n\nThat’s it!\n\nIf you followed all the steps above and got a Good signature, you can safely install the Electrum wallet.\n",

      title: "Cryptocurrency Wallet Backups: Your Options",
      content: "Secure crypto wallet backup solutions are a big theme.\n\nCrypto traders as well as hodlers tend to avoid work on backups, because it’s not fun. As someone pointed out on Reddit, people like to code creative hacks for all kinds of things related to crypto, but they will so often either skip backups entirely or never test them.\n\nNot a good idea with crypto, where you literally are your own bank.\n\nSeed Phrase Backups\n\nWhether you are using Electrum for Bitcoin, Exodus for all kinds of altcoins or a hardware wallet like Ledger, your default cryptocurrency wallet backup is always the backup of the 12+ word recovery seed phrase.\n\nThe seed phrase backup should be written on a piece of paper, in case you are writing down the literal full seed phrase.\n\nThere are safe ways to back up your seed phrase electronically, too.\n\n\n\nNon-Digital Backups\n\nBasic Seed Phrase Backup\n\nIf you can store your full seed phrase in multiple safe locations, a good choice is a piece of paper and regular pencil. Not ink or gel pen or anything that catches air humidity – just a regular pencil.\n\n\n  Electrum will display your seed while you are setting up your wallet, and it won’t let you finish the setup without writing the seed down and retyping it in.\n  In user-friendly wallets like Exodus, Jaxx or Blockchain.com you need to go to Settings and Backup. (It’s usually called the same.) That will show you the seed phrase. Write it down.\n  Exodus and possibly some other wallet will not display your recovery seed phrase if your wallet is empty.\n\n\nA decent place to store this seed phrase backup would be a safety deposit box in a bank or elsewhere, or your lawyer’s office.\n\nHow to make pencil-and-paper privkey backup safer\n\n\n  \n    Get a metal sheet seed phrase storage such as CryptoSteel or BillFodl.\n\n    They are equivalent products, CryptoSteel ships from EU while BillFodl from US. Both are made of high grade stainless steel and are resistant to rust, fire and explosion. Sometimes you can get them in bundle deals with Trezor wallets, check our Eternal Black Friday page for more.\n  \n  \n    Split your seed into chunks and divide them between several people. Then give instruction about the order of the pieces to a lawyer. You should not give the whole seed AND instructions to a single person.\n  \n  \n    Shuffle your seed. Example: A 12-word recovery phase splits into three groups by four words. Decide to move every third word to the following group. You should test yourself a few times on how to shuffle your seed back.\n  \n\n\nPaper wallet crypto backup\n\nA more technical way is to get a paper wallet generator.\n\nA paper wallet generator will print your seed phrase or private key along with a QR code that you will be able to scan with your smartphone.\n\nThis way is not so popular anymore, it’s here pretty much to just say the following:\n\n\n  Do not use a paper wallet generator that is hosted online.\n\n\nYou should use a paper wallet generator that you downloaded from Github, ideally from a release page of your coin’s developer team or from a link that was recommended on the dev’s website\n\n\n  \n    Always use a paper wallet generator offline.\n  \n  \n    To print a paper wallet, it is safer to connect to a printer via a cable instead of wifi.\n  \n  \n    The printer should be your own, not a public one. Data sent to print are in some cases retrievable from printers.\n  \n\n\nYou see how much easier it is to just write things down with a pencil.\n\nPaper wallet generators for some popular cryptocurrencies:\n\n\n  Bitcoin\n  Ethereum\n  Litecoin\n  Monero\n  IOTA\n  Stellar Lumens\n  PIVX\n\n\n\n\nDigital Backups\n\nA digital backup of your cryptocurrency wallet is the better option in case you are traveling across the border and are worried you will be searched.\n\nThe reason is that the first layer of security in digital backups is obfuscation, not encryption.\n\nIt’s about concealing the information that there is something important hidden. This is arguably difficult to do with a twelve-word seed phrase written in a Moleskine notebook. These are not early days of crypto anymore, too many people know what such a note holds and pretty much everyone knows what a Ledger wallet is.\n\nWord of caution.\n\nDigital backups are safe, if you know what you’re doing. Maybe you don’t want to risk it. That’s a fair choice if you are not used to using the command line. However, there are still a few things you should back up digitally even if it’s not going to be the seed phrase.\n\nWhat to safely back up digitally as a non-techie crypto holder\n\nLocation hints\n\nIf you have multiple seed phrases physically stored at multiple locations, you should definitely store hints as to where to find them.\n\nNo need to store the full directions, just the hint that will help you recall where the storage is.\n\nYou will need a hint for a cold storage that has not been accessed in a few years.\n\nPassword hints\n\nIt is safe to do the same for your password reminders: Back up the hints in an encrypted note in LastPass, or as an email draft in a zero-knowledge email client like Tutanota.\n\nUse 2FA.\n\nDon’t backup the actual full data, just the hints.\n\nThat way it’s safe.\n\nSpeaking of which…\n\n2FA codes\n\nBackup those. To multiple locations.\n\nAnd that’s you done if you are not willing to do any commandline-fu. No need to read any further.\n\nHow to Make Safe Electrum Wallet Backup\n\nNow onto the more technical way of digital crypto wallet backups.\n\nObfucation\n\nThe reason for coverups is that crypto wallets will be by default stored on your computer as something like walet.dat or in a directory called wallets or some other transparent thing.\n\nThere is a lot of malware that is programmed to look for these standard files.\n\nSince version 2.8, Bitcoin Electrum will always encrypt the wallet file, unless you choose not to. Your private keys are is therefore behind two layers of encryption: the keys are encrypted, and located inside an encrypted file.\n\nTo spend your Bitcoin, you need either the Electrum wallet file with its password or the seed phrase (private keys).\n\nYou do not need to back up both the seed phrase and the wallet file, but restoring a wallet from the recovery seed will not restore your transaction labels.\n\nIf you use them but you need to get rid of anything crypto (because, say, your laptop might get searched), you are better off backing up the wallet file.\n\nHow to backup the Electrum wallet on Mac\n\n\n\n\n  Open the Electrum wallet you want to back up.\n  \n    Go to File &gt; Save Backup.\n\n    This will duplicate the file at ~/.electrum to any location of your choice.\nFor obfuscation, name the Electrum export file randomly: Photos2015 or so.\n  \n  \n    Compress the directory into an encrypted, password protected archive:\n\n    $ tar zcvf Photos2015.tar.gz Photos2015\n$ openssl enc -in Photos2015.tar.gz -out Photos2015.bak.tar.gz -aes-256-cbc -salt\n  \n  You will need to use a password to encrypt the archive. Store a hint to it in a LastPass note.\n  Remove the unencrypted files.\n\n\nOptionally, copy your encrypted backup archive to an external hard drive, on your phone, into drafts in your (well secured) Tutanota mailbox or into cloud storage.\n\nIf you are going to cross national border, you can now safely uninstall the Electrum app.\n\nHow to restore Electrum wallet from your encrypted backup\n\n\n  \n    Decrypt and extract the archive that contains your Electrum wallet backup.\n\n    $ openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -in Photos2015.bak.tar.gz -out Photos2015.tar.gz\n\n    $ tar zxvf Photos2015.tar.gz\n  \n  \n    Now you have the original wallet file that can be opened directly from Electrum.\n\n    \n  \n\n\nThis is a digital backup method that gives you pretty good security.\n\nYour seed phrase is behind three levels of encryption, the file itself doesn’t give away that it is a cryptocurrency wallet and as long as you can do basic tasks from the command line, it’s all super quick and easy to do.\n\nAdvanced: Crypto Wallet Backup with a Decoy File\n\nIf you are super paranoid, make use of steganography to insert your crypto wallet backup file into a decoy image.\n\nOn Linux and Mac you don’t need any extra software to pull it off. The command you need to do that is one of the default ones:\n\ncat Photos2015.bak.tar.gz &gt; my-avatar-photo.jpg\n\nThis will insert Photos2015.bak.tar.gz into the image file my-avatar-photo.jpg. You can check that the image now has larger size - in Finder it will still look like any other image though.\n\nTo extract your wallet file, you do the same steps as above, but on with your decoy image as the input:\n\n$ openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -in my-avatar-photo.jpg -out Photos2015.tar.gz\n\n$ tar zxvf Photos2015.tar.gz\n\nAgain, this will yield the original wallet file that can be opened directly from Electrum.\n\nSummary\n\nCrypto wallets can be backed up on paper or digitally. Both ways have their pros and cons, each is more suitable for different situations.\n\nNon-digital backups are better for longer term, digital backups for shorter time, such as when you need to get rid of crypto software from your laptop only for a few days.\n",

      content: "Jump to the how-to:\n\n  How to Sign Message in Bitcoin Electrum\n  How to Verify Bitcoin Signature in Electrum\n\n\nA wallet signature is a way to prove that you are a high net worth individual. As such, this ownership verification is sometimes required as an entrance ticket to investment platforms.\n\nAddress signature verification is also sometimes requested when you lose access to an exchange account where you were not KYC’d.\n\nLast but not least, some regulated exchanges may also ask for wallet signature along with your documents for KYC verification.\n\nUse Electrum or send a small transaction to yourself\n\nSadly, signing &amp; verifying a message is no longer possible in the most popular wallets - Ledger wallet discarded this function years ago.\n\nIf you need to verify your ownership or prove that you are HNW, you have the option of loading your keys into an Electrum wallet, or sending a small transaction out of any wallet that you use.\n\nBoth proves that you have access to the private key, which in bitcoinland means a rightful ownership. You know what they say: Not your keys, not your bitcoin.\n\nIf you have your addresses monitored for transactions, use the signature\n\nSending a transaction out has the disadvantage that (depending on your wallet) the rest of your balance might get moved to a different address, too. (Most wallets utilize the concept of change addresses for enhanced privacy.)\n\nThe “change” transaction will be delivered into an address you still own, you do not lose any money other than the transaction fee. The annoying thing is that if you have a watch-only wallet set up, or use any other bitcoin address monitoring system, the change transaction will trigger all the alerts. You will then have to set up new monitoring.\n\nIf you want to carry on and learn how to sign and verify a message in Bitcoin Electrum, keep reading.\n\n\n\nHow to Sign Message in Bitcoin Electrum\n\nIf you do not use Electrum for the address you need to sign, find the seed phrase of your wallet and restore it in Electrum:\n\n\n  Open the Electrum wallet and in the File menu, select “New/Restore”\n  Select “Standard wallet”\n  \n    Select “Already have a seed”\n\n    If you need to verify ownership of a Legacy address starting with 1:\n    \n      Type in your seed phrase\n      Choose legacy\n    \n\n    If you need to verify ownership of a P2SH Segwit address starting with 3:\n\n    \n      Type in your seed phrase and click “Options”\n      Select BIP39 (ignore any warnings) (is that scary?)\n      Select derivation path “p2sh-segwit”\n    \n\n    If you need to verify ownership of a native Segwit address starting with bc1:\n    \n      Type in your seed phrase\n      Choose segwit\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nThen proceed with the following steps:\n\n\n  Open the Electrum wallet. If you have multiple wallets, choose the one which has the address you are verifying.\n  Go to Addresses and find the concerned address\n  Right-click the address and choose Sign/Verify Message\n  Copypaste the message to sign into its box and click Sign. You will be asked for the wallet password.\n  The signature string is in the bottom box.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to Verify Bitcoin Signature in Electrum\n\n\n  Open the Electrum wallet.\n  Go to Addresses and find the address you need to use.\n  Right-click the address and choose Sign/Verify Message\n  Paste the message that was meant to be signed into its box.\n  Paste the signature string into its box and click Verify.\n\n\n\n\nWhy do we use Bitcoin signatures\n\nMessage Signature as a proof\n\nFor obvious reasons, you cannot show the private key to anyone.\n\nShowing it would prove your ownership, but at the same time it would make you lose said ownership.\n\nOne of the established ways to prove the ownership of a private key is to sign a message with it. To sign a message you only work with the public address associated with your private keys, but you need to do it from the wallet that holds it.\n\nThat requires your physical access to your wallet device or laptop, and a password that decrypts the wallet and lets you use it.\n\nWallet Support\n\nMessage signing has become an advanced function. Most new crypto wallets that are user friendly do not support it.\n\n\n  Electrum: SUPPORTS MESSAGE SIGNING\n    \n      Electrum supports message signatures for all address formats: legacy, P2SH segwit and bech32 native segwit.\n    \n  \n  Trezor: SUPPORTS MESSAGE SIGNING\n    \n      Trezor wallet’s Chrome extension lets you sign a message with an address belonging to your wallet.\n    \n  \n  Ledger: NO SUPPORT\n    \n      Ledger wallet did support message signature and verification in its old web interface. The web UI us now deprecated. Ledger Live does NOT support message signing.\n    \n  \n\n\nExchange says your message signature could not be verified?\n\nSadly, a lot of crypto software that deals with bitcoin message verifications still will not validate bech32 signatures. The format is too new and most software libraries that deal with BTC were not yet updated to recognize bech32.\n\nIf you genuinely signed a message, the address was bc1 but the exchange customer support tells you the signature could not be verified, do point this out.\n\nThere is an alternative way to prove your ownership of that address: Move an arbitrary (but pre-defined) amount of crypto from the address in question to any other address you own.\n\nBy broadcasting a transaction from an address you prove you have the private keys to it. If it is a random specific amount, there is practically zero chance that the transaction out of the wallet could be coincidental. Any exchange should accept that as the proof of ownership.\n\nThe downside is you lose the transaction fees, especially if you need to first transfer some money to the address you’re verifying as well.\n",

      title: "Why and how to start trading cryptocurrencies?",
      content: "Cryptocurrencies are virtual or digital currencies that individuals can use to invest in, trade, or make online purchases.\n\nSince the inception of bitcoin in 2009, cryptocurrencies have endured a lot of both controversies and hype.\n\nWhile they had its share of ups and downs, cryptocurrency trading is gaining ground among investors without showing any signs of slowing down. Like gold, it is slowly becoming one of the most favored tradeable assets.\n\nDigital currencies are building its reputation in becoming one of the better trading options.\n\nHere are the reasons why:\n\n1. Cryptocurrency trading is secure.\n\nCryptocurrencies are virtual currencies that are not backed by real assets or tangible securities. They're traded between parties, with the exchange tracked on digital ledgers. These digital currencies use decentralized networks relying on blockchain technology — a distributed ledger enforced by a diversified computer network.\n\nIts root word \"crypto\" is short for cryptography, which refers to the art of solving or writing codes. As such, cryptocurrencies are hard to duplicate, break into, or double spend. It's practically immune to government intervention and manipulation.\n\n2. Cryptocurrency trading is accessible to anyone.\n\nRegulations vary from country to country, but most cryptocurrencies are open to individuals who have access to the Internet.\n\nA cryptocurrency enthusiast must sign up for a cryptocurrency exchange platform that facilitates buying, selling, and keeping cryptocurrency. With cryptocurrency trading, you only need a minimum amount in order to start trading. On the contrary, opening an account for stock trading requires an investor to shell out a good amount of cash.\n\n3. Cryptocurrency trading may provide better liquidity.\n\nLiquidity, or the ability for an asset to be converted to cash within an expected period, is important in any tradeable asset. In general, experts consider the cryptocurrency market as illiquid because transactions are dispersed across numerous exchanges, and these trades create an impact on market prices.\n\nHowever, various digital platforms and marketplace allow for the buying and selling of cryptocurrencies, such as the services that this company offers. These platforms help control cryptocurrency flows, leading to greater overall trading volume. This results in a more liquid exchange. That said, these digital assets generate better prices and faster transactions.\n\n4. Cryptocurrencies allow for faster account opening.\n\nBefore buying any type of virtual currency, you'll need to buy and sell via an exchange or platform, which requires you to create an account and store the currency in your digital wallet.\n\n5. Cryptocurrencies are volatile but may offer high returns.\n\nWhile this may concern some investors looking for stable revenues, some with high appetite risk may find this exciting. According to Investopedia, a known cryptocurrency was priced at about $20,000 per coin in 2018, the highest in the history of virtual currencies. A year later, however, the value dropped to $4,000 for each coin.\n\nThere's very little knowledge as to what exactly impacts the value of cryptocurrencies, but industry players point at inflation and the exponential increase in short-term speculative interest as two of the main reasons. The good news is that other types of virtual currencies have become more stable.\n\n6. Cryptocurrency offers CFD trading.\n\nA contract for difference (CFD) trading allows cryptocurrency market enthusiasts to trade and invest in an asset by engaging the services of a broker instead of opening an account in the market exchange.\n\nIn this way, an individual can speculate on cryptocurrency price movements with minimal investment or deposit. With a minimal amount, a trader can go long or buy if indications suggest that a cryptocurrency will rise in value or sell if he or she thinks the value will decline. However, this set-up doesn't shield you from losses because the profit or loss is calculated according to the full size of your position.\n\nThe good thing is that, once your projection is right, you'll have the opportunity to earn exponentially from a minimal investment.\n\nHow to start trading cryptocurrencies\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap.com, there are at least 6,500 different cryptocurrencies being publicly traded in the digital market.\n\nThe same website further pegged that the total value of digital currencies to more than $897 billion as of January 27, 2021.\n\nTo start trading, you will need to open an account with a crypto exchange.\n\nThere are a lot of exchanges out there, and an investor should choose the best one according to location (in your area), reputation, safety, and exchange rates.\n\nExchanges that follow strict know-your-customer (KYC) guidelines are making your transaction secure.\n\nMost exchanges have very low minimum deposit requirements for fiat currencies (government-issued currencies, like the US dollar) and cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nThe financial sector is quite divided in its assessment of the cryptocurrency trading market. Although anecdotal claims indicate there are individuals who've experienced high returns from a small amount of investment, there are a lot of skeptics who view it as an extremely risky undertaking.\n\nBefore embarking on cryptocurrency market trading, make sure that you have done your research and have a suitable risk management strategy in place.

      title: "Cryptocurrency 101: 5 Benefits of Cryptocurrencies",
      content: "For something that's not backed by tangible securities or real assets, cryptocurrency's appreciation of value during the previous years is nothing short of meteoric.\n\nYes, there had been head-spinning, stomach-churning price swings in the past.\n\nBut each time, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have emerged stronger and more attractive than ever.\n\nIntroduction to Cryptocurrency\n\nA person (or a group) known under the name Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency, in 2009.\n\nBitcoin was almost worthless when it first came out. But as people and businesses adopted this 'novelty' currency, its value soared.\n\nOther cryptocurrencies have cropped up since then. In 2021, there is more than five thousand alternative cryptocurrenies, or altcoins.\n\nBesides Bitcoin, other popular cryptocurrencies are Ethereum, Litecoin, Cardano, and others. Bitcoin, however, remains the king of cryptocurrencies.\n\nDigital currencies are virtually impossible to counterfeit; their protocol prevents anyone from 'double spending' a single unit of cryptocurrency.\n\nAs of February 2021, one Bitcoin is worth more than USD$50,000.\n\nThere is no need to buy a whole Bitcoin. It is possible to buy any tiny chunk of Bitcoin as well.\n\nBenefits of Cryptocurrency\n\nAs its value keeps on increasing, more and more people are turning into cryptocurrency trading; a virtual gold rush, you might say. And why not? Trading for this encrypted money has made a lot of people rich.\n\nBesides, more financial institutions and corporations are beginning to accept Nakamoto-san's creation.\n\nLet's look at a few benefits of cryptocurrencies:\n\n1/ Easy Transactions\n\nTraditional business transactions often involve a lot of middlemen—brokers, lawyers, agents—which can add not only unnecessary complications, but also all sorts of fees and paperwork.\n\nA cryptocurrency trading, however, is a one-on-one affair, especially if the trade occurs on a decentralized exchange. The middlemen are eliminated, which means no paperwork and not owing commissions to various people.\n\nCrypto trading is more straightforward and can be verified easily. Transactions can be seen, but not necessarily your personal information.\n\nThere are also hundreds of cryptocurrency trading exchanges. You can choose which among the best cryptocurrency exchanges suit you.\n\n2/ Confidential Transactions\n\nTransactions can be checked and verified by anyone, but the identity of the traders are hidden.\n\nPersonal identities are hardcoded and hidden from the public. These transactions are recorded in a sort of public digital ledger called the blockchain.\n\nBecause of the technology involved in the blockchain, no central authority manages the transactions and is solely between the buyer and the seller.\n\n3/ Trading Availability\n\nAnother effect of crypto exchanges not being government-controlled is that it's open 24 hours a day. You can trade with anybody anytime.\n\nYou'll have a chance to arrange your schedule and trade whenever it's convenient for you.\n\n4/ Lower Transaction Fees\n\nTrading fees in cryptocurrency exchanges are pretty low.\n\nExternal fees would be charged for a third-party service that manages your crypto wallet. But the cost doesn't come close to the transaction fees charged by banks or credit card companies, or for fees charged for transferring funds or writing checks.\n\nBitcoin miners responsible for verifying transactions generate the cryptocurrency, which is where their compensation comes from.\n\n5/ Volatility\n\nMany people might see the volatility of cryptocurrency, particularly Bitcoin, as a disadvantage.\n\nMany, but not all; some traders think Bitcoin's volatility is what makes trading in cryptocurrency exciting.\n\nSince 2010, there were around 47 instances where Bitcoin's prices have swung by at least 20%, which is enough to scare off investors new to cryptocurrencies.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin's prices have increased by more than 800,000% in the last ten or so years.\n\nOther cryptocurrencies have been stabler compared to Bitcoin, but it won't be long before speculators will turn their attention to these digital currencies.\n\nSome traders look at volatility and they see opportunities. But these investors are, by and large, crypto-savvy; so, before you join them, you should do your homework first and develop your strategy.\n\n\n  In a bull market, if prices go down, it will likely rebound and you could make a tidy profit—provided you remain steadfast and don't sell at the slightest breeze.\n  In a bear market, the situation is completely different.\n\n\nConclusion\n\nCryptocurrency hasn't yet reached universal acceptance as legal tender.\n\nHowever, banks and major corporations are warming up to it, despite its reputation for volatility. But despite the volatility of digital money, the benefits make up for its perceived risks. Savvy investors recognize cryptocurrencies as an exciting investment, which will likely be profitable in the long run.\n",

Get your free crypto trading journal on CoinMarketMan\n\nTo set up the automated trade tracking at CoinMarketMan, you only need to make an account and sign up either at Deribit, Bybit or FTX.\n\n\nSign up at coinmarketman.com\nNavigate to coinmarketman.com/unlocked\nFrom there, sign up at a partner exchange (Deribit, Bybit, FTX)\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerate a new API key on your exchange and make it Read-Only!\nNavigate to CoinMarketMan's API Manager\nSelect your exchange and copy-paste the API credentials.\n\n\nGenerate and set up your read-only API keys for any other exchange that you trade on. CoinMarketMan does not support all of them, but they will add platforms that are requested often enough from the form in your API Manager:\n\n\n\n2. Import your trades to CoinMarketMan\n\nCoinMarketMan pulls data from your trading platform via read-only API.\n\nYou need to trigger the import, but you don’t need to do it more than once a day as all the associated trade data are imported at once: Your open, your close, your stop loss, your profit and loss.\n\n\n\n\nNavigate to coinmarketman.com/journal\nSelect the exchange whose history you want to record\nThe app will detect any open positions - import them with one click, or if there are none, import your trade history\n\n\nHere the trading journal app will process the data and do the mundane data entry work for you.\n\nAutomatically imported data:\n\n  opens and stop losses for open positions\n  snapshot of current PnL and balances from open positions\n  open, close and PnL from closed trades\n\n\n3. Add extra notes about setup and psychology\n\nCoinMarketMan has space for additional info about your trade - both free and structured.\n\n\nUse the free note space to explain the reasoning you made to justify opening each trade\nTag your trades! Tagging your trades is the best way to backtest your strategies. You can add any tag, but it's a good idea to always tag your setup (eg \"bbands touch\")\nAnother useful thing to log are the transaction fees you paid to move the money to your exchange\nRecording your trading psychology is more helpful than it seems. Did you FOMO? Did you close on fear? Did you revenge trade?\nOne of the structured fields in CoinMarketMan lets you rate your confidence in the trading setup\n\n\n\n\nThe app will make a statistic overview from both your data and notes over time:\n\n\n  Wins and losses per trade duration\n  Wins and losses per trade size\n  Wins and losses per direction of trade\n  Setup confidence report - how much do you win when you trade randomly vs with confidence in your setup\n  Tag report - how much do you usually risk on each tagged setup, how often do you trade on each and how often do you win\n\n\n\n\nFor a trader who wants to improve his skill instead of repeating his mistakes, the last two reports bring the most value: Your setup confidence and the setup tag breakdown.\n\nAnd btw, you can’t really get these in Excel without some brain-splitting charting magic.\n\n4 Must-Do Trading Journal Practises\n\n\n\n\n  Make a log entry every day, even if you did not trade.\n\n\nEven a short note is plenty. If you did not trade, jot down the reason for it: “no good setup - balance moved to lending”.\n\n\n  Log your charts as well as what you see on them\n\n\nThe magic of crypto charting lies in drawing as many lines as possible so that it looks like you know what you are doing, of course. Jokes aside, looking back at your charts from last year, it is often not obvious anymore how you read them. Log that.\n\n\n  Tag your setups!\n\n\nEvery crypto trader has a couple of set ups or favourite patterns that they like to trade on. The most popular ones will certainly have something to do with Bollinger Bands, three pushes, RSI, Ichimoku or Divergences.\n\nMake tags for them to be able to filter them out and see how they actually perform for you.\n\n\n  Note your position management.\n\n\nSometimes, the setup was good, but it was you managing the position that brought you close to calling a mental health hotline.\n\nThat is why it is important to note whether you used a stop loss and what was your plan for exiting the position at all.\n",

      title: "Ultimate Guide on How to Buy Alt Coins: For Fiat, For Bigger Crypto, From USA, With KYC, Anonymously",
      content: "The crypto markets changed a lot over the past years. The original version of this guide was written in January 2017. Back then everyone traded at Poloniex and liquid altcoin-fiat markets didn’t exist yet.\n\nNow they do, which makes it is easier to onramp into any crypto of your choice.\n\nWhich the regulators noticed and so a new set of issues came about.\n\nWe have rewritten this article to explain the different onramping routes, comparing their pros and cons.\n\nContents\n\n\n  How to buy any altcoin of your choice\n  Where to buy altcoins for fiat with KYC\n    \n      Bitfinex - USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, CNH\n      FTX - USD^new\n      Independent Reserve - USD, SGD, AUD, NZD\n      Coinbase - US/EU\n      Kraken - US/EU\n      Bitstamp - EU\n    \n  \n  Where to buy altcoins for fiat anonymously (no KYC)\n  Where to trade small-cap altcoins for other crypto\n  Americans: Where to buy and trade crypto\n    \n      FTX US\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nHow to buy any cryptocurrency of your choice\n\nWherever you are based, the idea is always the same: Once you have bought some crypto, you will be able to exchange it for the cryptocurrency you actually want to buy.\n\nThat’s why buying large-cap cryptocurrencies is sometimes called onramping.\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\nThey are your gateway to small-cap altcoins, DeFi tokens, crypto derivative trading, staking and yield farming.\n\nThere are ways to onramp from fiat to crypto even if you are American, and even if you don’t want to do KYC, for absolutely whatever reason.\n\nYou pretty much only need to decide where to buy your initial gateway cryptocurrency and where to trade it further, if that’s what you want.\n\nTo choose where to buy your initial cryptocurrency, a good way is to go with a way that is local to your payment method: Same country for cash, same banking network for big exchanges, same e-wallet for p2p.\n\n\n\nBuy Altcoins for Fiat with KYC (buy on big exchanges)\n\n\n  Bitfinex - USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, CNH\n  FTX US - USD^new\n  Independent Reserve - USD, SGD, AUD, NZD\n  Coinbase - US/EU\n  Kraken - US/EU\n  Bitstamp - EU\n\n\nBitfinex\n\n\n  Accepts EU, parts of US and most of the world (SEPA, wire)\n  Banks in Who knows. Company resides in British Virgin Islands.\n  Altcoins Plenty!\n  Experience ★★★☆☆\n\n\nPROS\n\nThe Bitfinex trading interface has no contender, both in desktop app and on smartphones.\n\nThe mobile app has configurable permissions, so you can allow only the lending functionality for instance - in case you are worried about your phone’s security. More here\n\nThe exchange offers spot trading, leveraged trading, OTC, margin funding and derivatives exchange. Fees are low and get lower with traded volume.\n\nVerification is not required but you will need the full verification to purchase for fiat.\n\nAbout Bitfinex\n \nBitfinex 6% Fee Discount\n\nCONS\n\nBitfinex was hacked in August 2016.\n\nIts flagship IOU stablecoin Tether was hacked in 2017.\n\nTheir customer support can be unresponsive, and the interface will be a huge overkill for someone who just wants to buy and hold. Bitfinex is far more suitable for active trading than for plain buying.\n\nFTX\n\n\n  Accepts US\n  Banks in US\n  Altcoins A few\n  Experience ★★★★★\n\n\nMore active traders will find the trading interface of FTX and the products are probably the only serious competition to Bitfinex - and as it happens the former public face of Bitfinex now works for FTX.\n\nFor people who are not into active trading and are not even curious, FTX will be an overkill compared to straightforward exchanges like Independent Reserve or Coinbase that are geared towards buy-and-hold.\n\nPROS\n\nFTX exchange is getting quickly known for its derivatives platform, FTX.com. The FTX US is a separate platform.\n\nFTX US is a regular spot exchange, similar to Coinbase (except the fees are lower) or to Kraken (except their servers don’t crash three times a day).\n\nKYC Verification is not required up to certain traded amount, but you will need to get verified on either of the FTX platforms to deposit fiat and purchase altcoins for USD.\n\nAbout FTX\n \nFTX 5% Fee Discount\n\nUse code atnet at either FTX platform for 5% fee discount\n\nCONS\n\nInternational traders can buy and trade altcoins on the FTX.com exchange, while US traders can do so at the FTX US platform.\n\nThe FTX dotcom platform is not meant to be accessed by residents of the United States at all, as the interface very clearly states in the footer.\n\nFor buy-and-hold crypto investors there’s no issue at all.\n\nThe active trader will probably not like the fact that the international FTX branch runs derivative markets, tokenized stock trading, staking, defi and other products that in the US are not meant for retail investors.\n\nThe US branch of FTX is just a plain crypto spot market, listing coins that are not exactly hot anymore and not offering any interesting products.\n\nFTX.us 5% Fee Discount\n \nFTX.com 5% Fee Discount\n\nUse code atnet at either FTX platform for 5% fee discount\n\nBitStamp\n\n\n  Accepts EU, US and most of the world (SEPA, wire)\n  Banks in EU (Slovenia)\n  Altcoins Ripple, Ethereum, Litecoin (large-cap only)\n  Experience ★★★★☆\n\n\nPROS\n\nBitstamp is a reliable exchange.\n\nIf you bank in the EU, you will be using the SEPA payment to send fiat in or out. It clears quickly and costs not much.\n\nBitstamp accepts US customers too, but it is less convenient for US traders to wire money to Slovenia.\n\nBitstamp is a good choice for people who bank in Europe, have no intention to actively trade, but want a reliable exchange to buy crypto from. Bitstamp even provides super simplified instant buy interface.\n\nJoin Bitstamp\n\nCONS\n\nYou need to be fully verified to even access Bitstamp: ID, proof of residence, selfie.\n\nCertain account worth changes trigger additional KYC, such as questionnaire inquiring about how much you are about to traded and why will you be doing that.\n\nThe trading engine is slow and fees too high for active trading: Bitstamp rounds up the fee for every partial purchase which makes the whole trade relatively expensive.\n\nCoinbase\n\n\n  Accepts EU, US and most of the world (SEPA, wire)\n  Banks in US\n  Altcoins Ethereum, Litecoins, DeFi tokens (mix)\n  Experience ★★★☆☆\n\n\nPROS\n\nCoinbase is the most popular exchange and crypto wallet in the US.\n\nFor US residents it is supper convenient to deposit in there, buy crypto on the exchange and keep it in the wallet. They also have an EU bank account for EU residents.\n\nCoinbase lists a mixture of big and small cryptocurrencies, which makes it the easiest way to get exposure to new tokens (DeFi, anyone?).\n\nJoin Coinbase\n\nCONS\n\nIn 2017, Coinbase lost a court case with the IRS and is obliged to share user data with the IRS.\n\nThey are capitalizing a lot on the fact that the noobs choose them. (Not that it’s terribly wrong, just saying.) You can buy directly through the wallet but the fees can get crazy. The regular exchange market with normal fees is at Coinbase PRO (formerly GDAX).\n\n\n  Coinbase Wallet instant buy fee: between 1.49% and 3.99% depending on method\n  Coinbase PRO instant buy fee (AKA market order, fills right away): 0.25%\n  Coinbase PRO limit buy fee (AKA limit order, fills when the market gets there): 0\n\n\nLast negative is that Coinbase is tracing where your crypto came from. If you decide to sell a coin you didn’t store in Coinbase wallet, but its previous owner passed it through a casino or a darknet market, Coinbase will detect it and shut your account down without warning.\n\nKraken\n\n\n  Accepts EU, US and most of the world (SEPA, wire)\n  Banks in US, EU\n  Altcoins Plenty!\n  Experience ★★★★☆\n\n\nPROS\n\nKraken offers easy to use interface for simple buying, and even easier to use OTC. The bottom limit for OTC transactions is only 100k USD, trades are done via Telegram.\n\nKraken is the exchange with the most solid banking, and was awarded a banking license in 2020.\n\nKYC is required only to move fiat (ID, proof of address).\n\nKraken is the best choice for US residents to buy cryptocurrencies.\n\nJoin Kraken\n\nCONS\n\nKraken used to be the least reliable crypto exchange, the platform would crash all the time, but they seem to have gotten their stuff together. We’ll see how they’ll hold up during the next bull market.\n\nThe trading interface is still pretty janky. In a way, Kraken is the perfect complement of Bitfinex - Bitfinex is better for trading while Kraken for plain purchasing.\n\nIndependent Reserve\n\n\n  Accepts AUD, NZD, USD, SGD (Locations: Most of the world)\n  Banks in AU\n  Altcoins A couple, mix of large-cap and new DeFi tokens.\n  Experience ★★★★☆\n\n\nPROS\n\nIndependent Reserve is an Australian crypto market that is catered towards crypto buy-and-hold investors. It is not a place for active daytrading, kind of like Kraken isn’t.\n\nThe main advantage of Independent Reserve is their built-in DCA bot which makes it easy for long-term holders to DCA in or out.\n\nThey have an OTC desk and a tax calculator provided by KPMG. Financial advisory, insurance and other more traditional asset management services are available for a fee.\n\nCustomer support is pretty good.\n\nAbout IndepReserve\n \nJoin IndepReserve\n\nCONS\n\nBanks in Australia, so your wire will take a while. There is a small administrative fee for fiat transactions of less than 5000 USD worth and the exchange fees are not the lowest in the industry at all.\n\nYou have to get KYC verified even if you do not want to move fiat in and out.\n\nTheir trading interface is super basic, again - this is an exchange for simple buying, not for daytrading.\n\n\n\nHow to Buy Altcoins Anonymously (Without KYC)\n\nIn 2021, there is only one reliable platform that will let you buy crypto anonymously without KYC and that is LocalCryptos.\n\nLocalCryptos are NOT related to LocalBitcoins. LocalBitcoins is a technically unsound platform that can be no longer recommended.\n\n\n  Accepts Most of the world (wire, cash, venmo etc)\n  Altcoins ETH, LTC and BTC\n  Experience ★★★★☆\n\n\nWhy are LocalCryptos better\n\nLocalCryptos is a zero-knowledge dApp to which you sign up directly through your MetaMask or other crypto wallet.\n\nYou own the private keys of your crypto. The platform will never have a reason to ask you for KYC, since they don’t work with your crypto at all. You are always the sole owner of your cryptocurrency, even if you store it inside the LocalCryptos app.\n\nThe vendor you are buying cryptocurrency from might ask for your documents to lower the risk of fraud. This is not exposing you to the platform, the messaging system on LocalCryptos is end-to-end encrypted.\n\nEven if a government agency asks for access to your messages, LocalCryptos cannot provide any.\n\nJoin LocalCryptos\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to Buy Small Altcoins for Other Crypto\n\nFor crypto-to-crypto trades, the regulations are typically far less strict than for transactions between fiat and crypto.\n\nThere are plenty places where you can use BTC, ETH or some other larger crypto and swap it for the small-cap token of your choice without any KYC, in some cases without any need to sign up for an account.\n\nBuy-And-Hold, Small Amounts: Altcoin Wallet Built-ins\n\nIf you are looking for the fastest and easiest way to buy a smaller altcoin for a larger one, just use an exchange or swap built into your wallet.\n\nSince the exchange is inside an app you already use, the danger you will land on a scam imposter exchange is negligible. Another advantage of using wallet built-ins is the fact that many altcoin wallets will now let you stake your PoS altcoins directly from there.\n\n\n  Exodus wallet is one such wallet that has exchange, has staking AND is completely free. Exchange fees are a bit higher but for small one-off transactions it doesn’t amount to much.\n  Ledger wallets now also come with a built-in exchange and staking app within their Ledger Live suite.\n  MyEtherWallet offers a built-in swap for Ethereum-based tokens.\n\n\nBuy-And-Hold, Larger Amounts: Exchanges with Staking\n\nFor larger transactions the fee will start to matter, which is why you will want to take your money to an actual trading exchange.\n\nOther than the fee you might want to look at exchanges that can stake your exchange wallet contents for you. Staking an altcoin on an exchange will typically give you yearly yield of around 6-8%.\n\nStaking yields are not as outsized as with DeFi but there is less risk involved.

      content: "If you were around for the 2017 Bitcoin hard fork, you will well remember what a shitshow that became.\n\nEventually the fork resulted in a chain split that produced the segwit-enabled BTC as we know it today, and BCH which is a minor coin today. In August 2017 however, it was far from obvious which chain would be called “Bitcoin”, and it understandably brought a lot of turmoil to the markets.\n\nThe 2021 network upgrade is called Taproot.\n\nKey points about the Taproot softfork:\n\n\n  Taproot will make some types of transactions cheaper and more private.\n  It will help the network scale.\n  In the long run, the upgrade might wreck on-chain analysis.\n\n\nPros and Cons of Taproot\n\n\n  Taproot changes the way multisig transactions are done. It will make them cheaper and more private.\n  Multi-signature transactions are used by exchanges and institutions, so this will positively impact all users that buy or trade bitcoin.\n  But Taproot also makes multisig transactions such as exchange withdrawals impossible to tell apart from the rest of the transaction activity, which will cancel some parts of on-chain analysis.\n  Another drawback is a possible privacy leak in light wallets such as Electrum. This will depend on how the wallet developers will approach upgrading the software for Taproot though.\n\n\nMiners have to start signaling for or against it until August 2021.\n\nSo far, the majority of miners is signalling against Taproot.\n\nThe narrative explains that away by saying that miners are hardware-wise not organized well enough to upgrade their Bitcoin Core version so soon.\n\nMight be.\n\nBut knowing that “forgetting” to flip a switch somewhere in your mining farm is a sure way to send the markets on a rollercoaster, without the chance of having a three-letter agency coming to kick your ass, what would you do?\n\nHere is a list of tools to watch Taproot signalling\n\n\n  \n    \n      Resource\n      What it does\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      taproot.watch\n      Displays how miners signal for or against Taproot with each new block.\n    \n    \n      twitter memes\n      Twitter memes under the hashtag Taproot show what the community big-mouths think\n    \n    \n      braiins on Taproot\n      Long article that explains in detail what Taproot does with privacy and on-chain analysis\n    \n  \n\n\nIf you made an app to follow Taproot signalling or sentiments, we’ll be happy to add it to the list.

      title: "Cryptocurrency Tax 101: A Guide For Beginners",
      content: "Cryptocurrency has evidently taken the world by storm. This is perhaps due to its strong cryptography that ensures all online transactions are safe.\n\nIf you’re part of this digital currency frenzy, you’d want to know how cryptocurrency is taxed.\n\nThis brief guide will fill you in on all the tax details of crypto.\n\nTaxable Crypto Actions\n\nAccording to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), cryptocurrencies should be treated as capital assets, which means that they should be taxed.\n\nYou agree that not all individuals are wired to fill their tax returns entirely on their own. This is because it can turn out to be a pretty time-consuming process if you’re not used to it or you don’t exactly understand some of the technical terms.\n\nFortunately, you can use online tools, such as TaxBit, to simplify your crypto tax reporting.\n\nBut even so, you need to understand what crypto activities are taxable and which ones aren’t. Here’s a list of crypto transactions that attract taxes:\n\n\n  When customers pay you in crypto: If someone pays for your goods or services in crypto, your profits are taxable.\n  Holding your crypto for long: If you purchase crypto coins and hold them for more than a year, the IRS taxes this as a long-term capital gain.\n  Crypto mining: This refers to the process of approving and recording new transactions on a blockchain. It’s usually a very sophisticated process handled by supercomputers. If you engage in this, you’re rewarded in crypto tokens, which are also taxable.\n  Crypto gifts from marketers: If you receive digital currency as a reward for helping crypto firms get new customers, it counts as a taxable income.\n  Currency exchange: When you convert crypto to fiat currencies like the US dollar, Euro, or Japanese Yen, the gains you earn are taxable.\n  Trading cryptocurrency: Did you know that there are more than 7,800 cryptocurrencies in the market? The most popular include Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Cardano, USD Coin, Polkadot, Uniswap, Chainlink, Stellar, and Tether. If, for instance, you use your Bitcoin to purchase Ethereum, the gains you make are taxable.\n  Engaging in Decentralized Finance (DeFi): This refers to all cryptocurrency transactions aimed at dethroning the mainstream financial powers. A good example is lending large amounts of cryptocurrency to borrowers and earning interest from the loans. Such gains are taxable.\n\n\nNon-Taxable Cryptocurrency Activities\n\nThere are other crypto events that are non-taxable. Here are some of them:\n\n\n  Buying crypto: You won’t be taxed when you purchase digital money from cryptocurrency exchanges in any way - through DCA, on leverage for scalping, any form of trading. Traders can sometimes use this to offset their taxes.\n  Gifting crypto: The IRS won’t tax you if you gift your friend some bitcoins, for example.\n  Donating crypto: Likewise, if you give crypto coins to, say, a children’s home in need of financial support, you won’t attract taxes.\n  Short-term holding: If you buy digital cash and hold it for less than one year, in some countries you have no taxes to worry about. In other countries it is the opposite.\n  Wallet-to-wallet transfers: You don’t owe the government any taxes when you transfer cryptos from one of your wallets to another one.\n\n\nHow To Reduce Your Crypto Taxes\n\nIf you’re frequently transacting with cryptocurrencies, the tax burden could go unbearably high.\n\nTry some of the following tricks to reduce your tax burden:\n\n\n  Donate to charity: This reduces the total amount of cryptocurrency you hold so it doesn’t reach the taxable threshold.\n  Move to a low tax neighborhood: Some states, like California and New York, have generally higher taxes than others, like Cayman and New Zealand Islands. Consider shifting to such places so it won’t affect your income-generating projects.\n  Gift your crypto to family members: The IRS allows you to gift up to USD$15,000 annually before they start taxing you.\n  Time your transactions: Wait for that time when tax rates are lower and do your crypto transactions.\n\n\nCrypto Tax Season Preparations\n\nFor you to not stressfully panic when the deadline comes, get ready for the crypto tax season by doing the following:\n\n\n  Record all your transactions as soon as they take place. This way, you’re able to account for all costs, thus reducing your tax liability.\n  Fill Form 8949, which is the IRS-approved tax form for disclosing your crypto gains or losses. Add this form to Schedule D, which is the parent form for disclosing all your capital gains and losses.\n  If all this paperwork and computations seems too much for you, hire certified professional accountants to help you.\n\n\nFinally\n\nYou now have a general understanding of what cryptocurrency events are usually taxable and which ones aren’t. The rules change from country to country, though.\n\nBecause of that, consider using crypto tax software or hiring professionals to help you out.\n",

      title: "How Do Good Traders Pick The Right Crypto Exchange",
      content: "Bitcoin has been in the news in recent months for the wrong reasons.\n\nThe world's biggest digital currency that gained a lot of popularity over the years mainly because of its rapid growth has found it hard to continue the same trend. In April 2021, Bitcoin registered a peak value of USD $65,000 but has since cut by almost half.\n\nNevertheless, this digital currency is still far more valuable than it was a few years ago. It continues to attract new investors who are hopeful that the trend will soon change for the best. As a ripple effect, more crypto exchanges are also coming in to fulfill the world's growing demands.\n\nIf you're interested in trading, you can visit bestcryptoexchangeaustralia.com.au to compare some of the best crypto exchanges in Australia. But first, there are some things you'll need to keep in mind as a beginner before investing. Read on to learn more!\n\nWhat to consider as a beginner\n\nTo avoid getting caught up in the hype, you first need to think why you're investing in cryptocurrency. Everyone has an investment goal, and you should too!1\n\nAlso, make sure you understand how cryptocurrency works before investing your hard-earned money. Many people fail because they're too eager or excited to make their first dollar from trading cryptocurrency and forget all the fundamentals.\n\nFinally, know where and how to trade. This is crucial, especially now that the market is filled with scam platforms on top of legitimate ones.\n\nAre you interested in learning more?\n\nBelow is a short guide to help you get started on investing in cryptocurrency on an exchange:\n\nTip 1: Pick an exchange within your region\n\nOne of the most significant issues about exchanges is that some investors, especially beginners, cannot validate their business addresses.\n\nIf you can't find the company's address, then that should be a red flag.2\n\nHowever, it's difficult to know whether the location indicated is valid or not, if you're trying to register from a different country or state.\n\nAs such, experts recommend that you find a crypto exchange that's located in your country or a location where you can easily confirm its existence. For one, this will give you peace of mind, knowing the exchange you're signing up for has the needed documentation to operate.\n\nAnother advantage is, it gives you a good idea of where to start whenever you have complaints regarding the company.\n\nFor instance, if you get hacked, you might not know where to report your case because you're unsure of the jurisdiction within which the exchange falls. However, filing a lawsuit or complaint is made easier when you know the company's physical location.\n\nTip 2: Consider the security levels\n\nThe most critical factor in modern financial world is cyber-security.\n\nA crypto exchange with a less secure network puts your investments at risk, and that's what hackers usually target. Other than the location, one thing you should also consider when looking for a crypto exchange is the security protocols put in place to safeguard your data and, most importantly, your coins.\n\nIt might be difficult to judge an exchange's overall security at first glance, but some pointers should give you a clue on the same. For instance, does the company have a two-factor authentication system when accessing your account?\n\nThis is an extra layer of security that's necessary in this day and age, especially in financial institutions. When this or any other related security protocol isn't available, that should be reason enough for you to find another crypto exchange.\n\nAnother red flag you should look out for is the use of hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP). Today, any organization serious about data security, especially their clients' data, should be willing to invest in HTTP's more secure iteration, hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS). The latter is more secure since it encrypts standard HTTP requests before sending them to the desired destination. This makes it difficult for hackers to crack the website's security.\n\nFinally, you won't be wrong to go through the company's history. Check our reports on the most common cryptocurrency security threats in 2020 as they were faced by the exchanges and see how the platforms dealt with them.\n\nIf there's anything unclear, be sure to ask relevant authorities or anyone who's dealt with the exchange, before signing up and starting your crypto portfolio.\n\nTip 3: Transactions speed\n\nHow long will you wait before the cryptocurrency coins are credited to your account?\n\nThis is something that every crypto exchange should be ready to communicate to its customers. In fact, the user manual should have all the necessary information regarding the same.3\n\nSo what's the average transaction speed? This may vary from one exchange to another and depend on the size of transactions you're making. Generally, it should take anywhere between a few hours to a day. In case of any delays, the company is obligated to inform you beforehand.\n\nSpeaking of transactions and delays, it's imperative that you ask about the pricing. Some crypto exchanges charge more than what you'd paid earlier because the market keeps changing. Others, however, prefer to stick to the initial price until the end of the transaction. To avoid any inconveniences and frustrations, make sure the exchange has cleared up any related issues before committing to any contract.\n\nTip 4: Transparency is paramount\n\nDue to the rising security risks, most crypto exchanges store their tokens offline to prevent hacking.\n\nAs a trader, you have the right to be informed about the exchange's cold storage location. Any exchange that's not ready to provide the necessary information, including the addresses of this cold storage, should be scrapped off your list of potential candidates.\n\nSuch lack of transparency is a red flag and one that you should take seriously to avoid regrets in the future.\n\nConclusion\n\nWith the growing popularity of cryptocurrency, there has been a significant increase in the number of exchanges.\n\nAs such, distinguishing between a genuine and a scam platform can be difficult for any prospective trader, especially for newbies.\n\nAs a first-time crypto trader, before signing up to any platform, you should consider the location, transaction speeds, security, and transparency levels. By following the tips in this post, you'll make your cryptocurrency journey a lot easier for you.\n\nGood luck and happy hunting!\n\nReferences\n\n\n  \n    \n      \"How To Buy Cryptocurrency\", Source: https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/how-to-buy-cryptocurrency/ &#8617;\n    \n    \n      \"Don't Buy Your Bitcoin From A Place That Could Disappear Overnight\", Source: https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/21/how-to-pick-the-best-cryptocurrency-exchange.html &#8617;\n    \n    \n      \"Best Crypto Exchanges\", Source: https://www.investopedia.com/best-crypto-exchanges-071855. &#8617;\n    \n  \n\n",

      title: "Kraken Review: Features, Fees, Security, and User Experience",
      content: "Kraken is a prominent cryptocurrency exchange and offers some of the most attractive features - low fees, great security, user-friendly interface.\n\nThe primary goal of this review is to analyze Kraken's features and compare them to other top-tier crypto exchanges. We will also go into detail on Kraken’s fees and security.\n\nKraken’s (Almost) Impeccable Reputation\n\nKraken has been around since 2014 and has built their reputation by providing a secure trading platform with low trading fees. The company was quick to respond when Mt Gox went down in early 2014 and built their advantage on the market gap that came about with Gox’s failure.\n\nOther than security, user-friendliness is another focus of Kraken. The user interface is easy to understand, including the KYC and deposit process. This should not be overlooked in any cryptocurrency exchange - as a trader you will spend a good amount of time working with the platform’s UI and you do not want to waste your attention on an app that is not streamlined.\n\nThe only thing that tarnishes Kraken’s reputation are the notorious problems with overloaded trading engines at peak market times. Traders at Kraken spot markets have been for years reporting serious mishaps, such as stop orders not triggering.\n\nWhat Does Kraken Offer to Crypto Investors?\n\nKraken is a cryptocurrency exchange and offers a wide range of services to its users. It provides margin trading, short selling, and is one of the largest Bitcoin marketplaces in the world.\n\nKraken was founded in 2011 by Jesse Powell and has grown to become one of the most popular cryptocurrency exchanges today.\n\nKraken provides a wide range of services to its users such as margin trading, short selling, and is one of the largest Bitcoin marketplaces in the world. Kraken acquired the Cryptowatch charting platform and the cryptocurrency derivative platform Cryptofacilities which it integrated as a new product Kraken Futures.\n\nWhat Are Kraken's Fee Structure &amp; Trading Limits?\n\nKraken is one of the world's leading cryptocurrency exchanges with a focus on trading in the Euro and USD markets.\n\n\n  Q: What are Kraken's fees?\n\n\n\n  A: Kraken's fees are dynamic based on trading volumes and vary by market.\n\n\nThe fee you agree to pay is set at the time of your funding. The fees may vary depending on the size of your trade and whether or not you placed it during the \"High\" or \"Low\" price window.\n\nIt also depends on whether or not you're using leverage, which can lead to higher costs if you're trading above a certain value\n\nDoes Kraken Offer Security &amp; Customer Support?\n\nKraken offers security and professional support to its users. Their platform makes it easy for people to buy, sell and trade cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin, as well as smaller niche altcoins.\n\nKraken is a cryptocurrency exchange headquartered in Japan. It operates globally with offices in San Francisco, New York City, London, Paris, Warsaw, Singapore and Tokyo. Kraken also has an office in Toronto.\n\nIn terms of security, Kraken offers two-factor authentication as well as other security measures that make it difficult for criminals to steal your account information or access your funds.\n\nOf course, as with any crypto exchange, there are additional risks associated with trading on Kraken's platform because it is not regulated by any financial authority. There is always a chance of losing money if you choose to trade cryptocurrencies and it is paramount to do your own research before you deposit money to a platform.\n\nAlso, regarding the instability of cryptocurrencies and the increasing requirements to comply with KYC standards, it has become increasingly important for cryptocurrency exchanges to provide reliable connection with the legacy banking world.\n\nKraken is an exchange that has long offered a wide range of cryptocurrencies as well as fiat currencies such as USD, EUR, GBP and JPY.\n\nKraken has been recommended by Investing.com for years now and offers an easy-to-use interface with a minimum number of steps in order to create your account and start trading from almost any location in the world.\n\nHow Smooth and Secure Is the User Interface of Kraken?\n\nThe security measures taken by Kraken can be seen in its forcing of 2FA authentication using Google Authenticator on individual user accounts.\n\nThe interface is customizable and sleek and has a clear and confident feel to it. It helps create the impression that Kraken is a professional trading platform.\n\nThe charting and order book visualisation may be a little difficult for a beginner, especially on the derivative platform Kraken Futures. If that is the case for you, there is always the option to trade directly from Cryptowatch - a charting app that most crypto traders are very familiar with.\n\nCryptowatch is also the go-to gateway to your orders and trades in times of high traffic where the default Kraken’s web app might get less responsive. Just log-in with your Kraken credentials at trade.kraken.com/.\n",

      title: "The Dealbreakers in Choosing BTC p2p Lending Platform",
      content: "Peer to peer lending has properly taken off in late 2020 as a way to circumvent banks and their sometimes-painful terms when it comes to getting small loans. One problem, however, is that cyber security is a factor.\n\nLegacy online P2P platforms rely on cloud servers for all their transaction data storage. That is the standard, but it does have some issues security-wise and does leave some of them fairly vulnerable. A good solution to avoid this pitfall is to use blockchain because it is inherently a more secure storage of transactional data due to its immutable nature.\n\nOf course, even Bitcoin based P2P lending platforms are not all created equal, some are better than others.\n\nTo choose the right one for you, you will need to\n\n\n  evaluate your priorities\n  decide on your acceptable and unacceptable risks\n\n\n…and see which platforms fill your conditions the best\n\nIn this article, we will go over some of the general things to be on the lookout for so you can make an informed decision when making the move to a Bitcoin based P2P platform. These are just a few things that absolutely everyone should consider, regardless of their goals and priorities.\n\nYour money is your responsibility though. Always do your own research and consider this guide as more of a primer.\n\nPlatform security in P2P lending\n\nHow secure the platform is should be your primary concern when choosing the right lending system. As secure as the blockchain is, there are some moments where there is a weak link in the system.\n\nBitcoin wallet purchases can be one of those weak links so you need to look into how the platform is keeping this part of the process safe.\n\nIn P2P lending, typically there will be a third party to handle the transaction. Make sure to do your due diligence on this middle man as well, not only on the P2P platform. Sometimes it will need a bit of digging to find out who your middleman is but do not let that stop you.\n\nOnce your Bitcoin lands in its final destination, that is on the lending platform, the high security should kick in. That is, if your platform has it.\n\nHackers are not able to hack the blockchain, but they have found ways to hack into third party servers.\n\nAll the movements of your deposit between your account and the borrowers will be registered on blockchain and cannot be changed.\n\nSo, look for things like two-factor authentication for secure sign in and the option to whitelist geolocations for login or indeed BTC addresses for withdrawals.\n\nIf the platform is insured, even better. In that case you should have some recourse if something did happen to your funds. Do not rely on that in case the businesses is located outside of your country though.\n\nWhat are the lending platform fees?\n\nOne of the biggest benefits to using a Bitcoin P2P platform is the lower fees generally. But, there is some variance between platforms as to how much they charge for fees.\n\nUsually there is going to be a fee for buying and selling. These fees are usually publicly disclosed so you can shop around. What isn't always so clear is if there are other fees for using the platform.\n\nMost don't charge for deposits and withdrawals, for instance, but others do. Some platforms don’t explicitly charge for withdrawals, but their transaction fee is always way over the network fee at any moment. Some platforms will charge you for transactions below certain value, some will charge for large transactions.\n\nMake sure you know what you are getting into and read the fine print on everything that will cost you money.\n\nQuick processing of deposits and withdrawals\n\nAnother thing to look out for is how fast the transactions are, especially for movements to and from the platform.\n\nThere can be quite a difference in how long it takes to withdraw your money, for example.\n\nLook for platforms that have greater user base or also offer professional services, like OTC. That makes it more likely they will have a lot of funds at their disposal at any time and you shouldn't have to wait more than a day to have your funds deposited into a bank account.\n\nThe same goes for buying a loan. Look to see how long it takes to get your loan funded. If there is a wait of several days, you could be going through the hassle of shorting a loan and then having to wait for it to be funded, which is a lot of time and effort.\n\nWhat's the minimum amount to invest?\n\nAnother thing to be aware of is the minimum. With some platforms, the minimum is going to be as low as $50. This is great for those who only have a little bit of extra money to invest.\n\nWith others, the minimum may be as high as $1000 or even more. If you only have a few hundred dollars to invest, you may be better off looking elsewhere.\n\nYou also want to look at the maximum amount. Many platforms have a maximum of around $50,000. This may be large enough for you, but it may not in some cases.\n\nIn crypto, you can’t hide reputation\n\nReputation is also a very important thing to consider because you are entrusting your hard-earned Bitcoin with the site. The best way to get a good idea of how well they operate is to look at other reviews from people who have used the platform before and see what they say.\n\nYou should be looking for more than just a good reputation. You want to know that the people running the platform are reputable and that they have the right experience to run the site.\n\nThere are some P2P platforms that are owned by people who once were in the Bitcoin mining industry and are still active members of the community. While they are not necessarily the best choice to run P2P lending sites, they are still a good choice for those who are looking for an alternative to traditional banks.\n\nEase of Use\n\nWhile a lot of the sites are fairly easy to use, there are some that are easier to use than others. This is something that you should be looking for because the easier it is to use the platform, the easier it is to get the loan that you need.\n\nAlso, look for a site that is easy to use for people who are not tech savvy. If you send money to a site that is hard to use, then you could be ripped off or the money could be stolen.\n\nCustomer Support\n\nWhen you are dealing with money, you will find that customer support is important. You will need to be able to contact someone if there is a problem. The site is supposed to be secure, but that doesn't mean that there won't be any problems from time to time.\n\nMake sure that you read comments from other people who have used the site and see how well their customer support is. If you have a problem, you should be able to contact the site so that you can get a resolution.\n\nConclusion\n\nThese are the most important things to take a look at when deciding on a P2P platform. There are other things that you can look at as well, but these are the top four.\n\nThese platforms are fairly new, but they are growing in popularity as people look for alternatives to traditional banks. It is a great way to get the cash that you need quickly and with a low hassle.\n\nOnce again, you should always do your due diligence before signing up for a loan from a P2P site.\n",

While this process can boost your crypto profits, there are quite a few beginner mistakes you should avoid to lower your risks of losing really badly.\n\nSince this is a 101, let us first understand what exactly crypto margin trading is and how it works.\n\nAlready familiar with all this? Jump to the list of margin trading mistakes\n\n101: What is Crypto Margin Trading?\n\nWhen you open any trading account there are two types of positions: short and long. A short position is betting against the price of the crypto asset whereas a long position is betting for the price of the crypto stock to increase.\n\nEngaging in crypto margin trading means borrowing money from a third party like a crypto exchange or a margin lender, to trade in the crypto market with more capital than you have in your trading account. This additional trading balance is called leverage.\n\nTrading on leverage is technically a very simple process but comes with risks. Very similar to margin trading on legacy stock markets, it allows you to earn huge profits but at higher risks of loss.\n\nSimple example: If you choose a 50% margin then you can purchase $500 worth of BTC with $250 of your own money with the remaining $250 being loaned by the third party.\n\nWhat is Initial Margin?\n\nThe most important principle to note here is that you need to keep a certain percentage of your original invested capital to keep your leveraged position open. This is a set amount which will be held in your margin account as collateral by your trading platform, to make sure you never end up owing money to your lender.\n\nThis default balance is sometimes called initial margin. Since this is a requirement, the initial margin levels are always specified by crypto exchanges in their terms.\n\nWhat is Margin Call?\n\nOnce again, purchasing bitcoin and alt coins on margins is risky due to the market fluctuations. So when the market turns against your open margin position and your account balance falls below a certain threshold, your trading platform or broker will issue a margin call that tells you to add more money to your account.\n\nIf you fail to do so, the broker can sell off the position and charge you. This is called liquidation, or in crypto traders’ jargon, getting rekt.\n\nEvery trading platform functions on different rules, so be sure to look up the terms of your broker.\n\nBut as for crypto trading platforms, very often margin call already equals liquidation. This is due to the high volatility of crypto markets and also due to the fact that the markets are not regulated and it is even still possible to trade crypto without KYC.\n\nWhy do Coin Traders Use Leverage?\n\nSpeculative margin traders use the fluctuations in the cryptocurrency market to earn profits.\n\nThe price volatility in crypto markets being high as it is, the profits coming from margin trading can be truly outsized. The chance of an outsized gain is mostly what appeals to individual retail traders who are typically not interested in the premise of cryptocurrencies.\n\nThere are non-directional and non-speculative ways of using leveraged trading too, such as derisking. Hedging and yield strategies appeal most to hodlers.\n\nWhile trading on leverage may sound like an easy process, it requires experience, skills, strategies, and preparation to make the most of your investment.\n\nMost successful margin traders are considered serious traders as it requires them to approach the crypto market differently to succeed. Conversely, do not attempt margin trading crypto unless you are willing to learn the skill and slowly gain experience.\n\n\n\n5 Beginner Mistakes in Crypto Margin Trading\n\n\n  Avoiding Practice with Paper Trading or Small Positions\n\n\nOne of the most common mistakes made by amateurs or beginner traders is directly starting with money. Especially with big money - whatever it is that feels like big money to you.\n\nIf you are interested in becoming an experienced trader, it requires skill, knowledge, and a whole lot of practice.\n\nInvesting blindly can do you more harm than any good. When you practice trading through a paper trading account, it allows you to try different strategies and understand how they work. It also teaches you how margin trading crypto works technically.\n\nWhat paper trading cannot teach you is working with your emotions. Trading psychology is something that only enters the game when you start using real money. That is why many traders recommend starting with a real trading account as soon as possible, but keeping your positions trivially small at first.\n\nSo before you start investing with real money, consider paper trading as it can improve your trading skills and make better decisions.\n\n\n  Not Using Stop Loss\n\n\nStop Loss is an in-built feature in most crypto exchanges to prevent taking further losses beyond a certain level that you can specify for each of your leveraged positions.\n\nIt means setting a limit for your trading to close your trade at breakeven or not too far below. Traders use the stop loss feature for risk management. No matter how experienced or confident you are in trading, utilizing the stop-loss feature is always helpful.\n\nOne of the tricks that most newbie margin traders do not think of is moving your stop loss.\n\nBasic example: You are margin long DOGE on the DOGEUSD market. Your entry price was $0.76 and your stop loss was at $0.71. The market moved and now DOGE sits at $0.8 and you move your stop loss to $0.78. This way it is guaranteed that you will exit the position with at least some profit, no matter how the market moves next.\n\nSince the crypto market is volatile, setting a stop-loss and moving it into profit will help you lock-in your gains.\n\n\n  Paying high fees\n\n\nIn crypto margin trading, an investor borrows money from a third party so that they can use it as leverage. In futures trading, there is usually no fee to use leverage. On the contrary in spot trading, you pay your lender a fee for providing you with the extra money.\n\nChoose the right trading platform while margin trading. Platforms like Bitfinex let you track how expensive your margin loans are. If you are not happy with the costs your lender is charging, you can close the loan and the platform will assign you a different, cheaper lender.\n\nThis is an easy to avoid unnecessary costs in margin trading and earn a higher total profit.\n\n\n  Revenge Trading\n\n\nAs an investor or trader, you must learn to accept losses.\n\nEven the most experienced traders face losses, sometimes daily. Yes, it can be frustrating and annoying but attempting to take on riskier trades during your loss is bad management of your finances.\n\nIt is better to take a step back than to take three steps forward when you face loss. Instead, focus on improving your trading plan and also find out what you missed out on to avoid further losses.\n\n\n  Not doing fundamental analysis\n\n\nWay too many crypto trading newbies just choose popular cryptocurrencies and start trading.\n\nWhile this technique can be fun and often rewarding, in the long run, the habit of not doing your research will cost you money. Even without margin, your bad investment choices will negatively affect your crypto portfolio.\n\nThe best to avoid this mistake is by doing a fundamental analysis of the assets you are interested in.\n\nSeveral crypto analysis tools can help you make an informed decision. This in turn can help you mitigate future losses.\n\nBottom Line\n\nBy using the aforementioned tips, you can avoid making beginner mistakes and invest in the right platform at the right time. Understanding the different ways of cryptocurrency markets will help you earn loads of money.\n\nEven though margin trading is very risky, it can be highly profitable when done right. Nobody wants to hear this, but it is just a skill that can develop through focused work over time.\n",

      title: "3 Ground Rules of DeFi Trading and Investing",
      content: "The cryptocurrency (or \"crypto\") market has been on a rollercoaster of ups and downs since the beginning and its newer iteration, the DeFi markets, are continuing the tradition.\n\nBut there are also plenty of reasons why people want to trade cryptocurrencies. Crypto trading, DeFi staking and NFT trading can be a great way to make more money and make sure you are not relying solely on the legacy stock market.\n\nAs the famous Dog Money song goes, crypto is a great opportunity for traders than traditional investments such as bonds or savings accounts which do not offer much return anymore.\n\n\n\n3 Ground Rules of DeFi Trading\n\nRule 1: Get your coins off exchange\n\nThe first rule of trading and investing is always the same on any crypto market.\n\nUnlike traditional currencies, cryptocurrencies exist only as a shared digital record of ownership stored on their own blockchains. When you buy cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum or any DeFi token via a crypto exchange, you are actually purchasing the coins themselves, not just a contract or promise, as it usually is with legacy trading.\n\nBecause of this, after you buy your crypto, you are always best off to withdraw your coins to a crypto wallet and keep them in there until you want to sell.\n\nIn DeFi trading, this comes with an additional advantage: Your wallet can stake your DeFi coins for you and earn you passive income.\n\nBy staking cryptocurrency, you are holding a currency to verify transactions and support the network in exchange for receiving a reward. Staking can be a great way to use your crypto to generate passive income while sitting at home while watching Netflix, especially if you hold cryptocurrencies that offer high interest rates for staking.\n\nRule 2: Do your own research\n\nThe DYOR acronym is a mainstay in crypto, but is even more crucial on newer markets like DeFi or NFT.\n\nDeFi, or decentralized finance, has been around for more than five years but only started getting traction in 2020. DeFi was designed with the goal of providing an alternative to traditional banking. The idea is that since any person can act as their own bank thanks to bitcoin, they should also be able to act as their own broker and have access even to advanced financial products that are usually reserved only to Wall Street.\n\nThe benefits of DeFi are access to wider range of products, increased privacy for users, and less government control over your money. Some people have even taken out and paid off loans worth millions of dollars without the need for any personal identification.\n\nWith the lack of oversight however comes the increased risk of fraud. Follow the most basic tips on how to pick a DeFi trading platform to make sure you will at the very least have the possibility of legal action, in case something goes wrong.\n\nRule 3: Create a DeFi Portfolio\n\nPortfolio diversification does not always work in crypto, but if you really DYOR, you will be able to select less correlated DeFi coins quite easily. Read this guide on how to separate cryptos by fundamental value and by potential valuation.\n\nOne portfolio management tool that we recommend a lot is Shrimpy. It’s a freemium crypto asset management tool that can rebalance your portfolio automatically under the paid plat at 13 USD per month. More on how it works in this guide.\n\nWith another tool, egg.fi, you can easily and safely create a decentralized finance portfolio for your cryptocurrency holdings. EGG is a trusted tool that allows users to manage their decentralized portfolios on the blockchain with no need for any intermediaries or centralized servers. You can be confident about where your funds are stored because they cannot be accessed by outside sources such as hackers or governments without permission from its owner.\n\nTo sum it up\n\nIt is becoming increasingly difficult for investors to ignore cryptocurrency. These days, you are slowly being left behind unless you own some cryptocurrency.\n\nA portfolio tracker is a key value for DeFi investors, along with the ability to choose a platform to buy from.\n\nCheck our Tools page for more handy apps to help you manage and track your crypto assets.\n",

      content: "Investing in crypto has its risks, but if done right, its benefits outweigh all the risks that come with it.\n\nBitcoin was the first crypto coin and was launched in 2009.

      title: "10 Easy Tips To Earn Rewards With Cryptocurrency",
      content: "Do you want to earn rewards and bonuses without the hassle of a credit card? If so, then spending cryptocurrency might be the way for you.\n\nCryptocurrency as a digital means of payment is finally gaining popularity in the last few years. It's not so uncommon to use it for online transactions anymore, it can be traded in exchange for other currencies or products.\n\nIn this post, we will focus on one particular aspect of cryptocurrency - its incentives when you use them to make purchases.\n\nThere are numerous cryptocurrencies to choose from, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin. Each has unique features that make it attractive to users.\n\n10 Tips for earning crypto rewards\n\nHere are 10 easy tips to help you start earning rewards with cryptocurrency:\n\n\n  \n    Use A Cryptocurrency Credit Card For Online Transaction\n\n    Cryptocurrency credit cards allow you to spend your coins like regular currency.\n\n    This is a great way to use your coins for everyday transactions and earn rewards and bonuses. Several different cryptocurrency credit cards are available, like the Binance Visa Card, BitPay Visa Card or the Wirex Visa Card. These cards work like regular credit cards and can be used in all retailers that accept prepaid Visa cards.\n\n    The best way to earn rewards using crypto credit card is to purchase online or in person, because crypto cards come with cashback and discount coupons when you use them for payments. There are plenty of online retailers that accept cryptocurrency, which you can use to get discounts or rewards.\n  \n  \n    Stake Some Of Your Cryptos\n\n    Staking your cryptocurrency means that you're holding onto it instead of spending it. When you stake a certain amount, the network will reward you with coins.\n\n    Another benefit of staking is that you support the security of the blockchain, without practically risking much. Learn how to stake on Solana to get started if you want to know more.\n  \n  \n    Get A Cryptocurrency Wallet\n\n    A cryptocurrency wallet is a digital storage device that allows you to store your coins. There are several kinds of wallets, such as hardware wallets, software wallets, and web-based wallets.\n\n    In 2022, most wallets support PoS alt coins and offer bonuses and rewards. Those are either in a form of “savings account” or as staking directly from your wallet. Staking is the safer and less risky option.\n\n    Because lesser-known cryptocurrencies can’t usually be acquired by direct bank transfers yet, the best option to transfer your crypto is by using conversions. Many banks support common cryptocurrencies today (like Bitcoin). This can be converted from your existing cryptocurrency. For instance, if you have a KuCoin, you’ll have to exchange it with a different token to transfer the bank to the crypto wallet in your bank account. If you’re interested, you may visit https://cryptochronicle.io/how-to-withdraw-funds-from-kucoin/.\n  \n  \n    Use A Cryptocurrency ATM\n\n    A cryptocurrency ATM is a machine that allows you to buy and sell cryptocurrencies using cash. These machines are becoming more popular, so be sure to look for them in your area.\n\n    Cryptocurrency ATMs have slightly different pricing than exchanges like Coinbase, so you might easily profit by buying on an exchange and selling in an ATM. However, be sure to check the ATM’s fees.\n\n    Some cryptocurrency ATMs also offer rewards and bonuses for using their services. Unlike a regular ATM, cryptocurrency ATMs aren’t linked to a bank account. They link to a cryptocurrency exchange connected via the Internet. Crypto ATMs can be used to buy and sell various cryptocurrencies because they have the same components as a regular ATM, including a monitor, bill acceptor, bill dispenser, and QR scanner.\n  \n  \n    Join A Cryptocurrency Pool\n\n    A cryptocurrency pool is a group of small crypto holders who mine or stake cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrency pools such as Genesis Mining or AllNodes might offer rewards and bonuses for joining their pool. They are always a good way to earn rewards even if you are a small holder. In staking this principle works less so than in mining, but in both these activities there are better rewards if you participate with a lot of money or a lot of resources at once.\n\n    So, for smaller investors the rewards gained through a pool will be typically somewhat better than what they could earn on their own.\n  \n  \n    Mine A New Cryptocurrency\n\n    If you want to earn rewards with cryptocurrency, you might consider mining it yourself. Mining cryptocurrencies can be a great way to earn rewards. However, it does require resources and time.\n\n    Mining newly launched cryptocurrencies is always much easier as there is less competition. You may want to check if any of the new coins that you gained via airdrops doesn’t have a good mining opportunity.\n\n    However, before considering this path, keep in mind that mining a new cryptocurrency is costly and painstaking, but the rewards are worthwhile if you succeed. You can even earn more cryptocurrency without putting down your money through mining. You can set up a mining rig using an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) and graphics processing unit (GPU).\n  \n  \n    Trade-In Cryptocurrency For Goods Or Services\n\n    Some p2p marketplaces allow you to trade cryptocurrency for other currencies, products, and gift cards.\n\n    These sites offer great rewards when using them to make trades with your coins which you can use on future transactions.\n\n    More and more businesses are now accepting cryptocurrency as a method of payment, so the next time you go shopping, you won’t need to bring cash or charge your credit card but use your crypto earnings instead.\n  \n  \n    Participate In A Cryptocurrency Bounty Program\n\n    A bounty program is an online program offered by cryptocurrency developers to encourage users and companies in the community to promote their coins. When participating in a bounty program, you earn rewards when completing marketing tasks for that project or company, if your work is approved by the bounty manager.\n  \n  \n    Turn Your Dollars Into Stablecoins\n\n    Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency pegged to the value of another currency.\n\n    They offer stability and can be used for online transactions. Furthermore, they are easy to use and can be converted back into your original currency at any time.\n\n    Stablecoins have the advantage that you can stake them or lend them for a far higher interest rate than what you can get in your bank for the equivalent fiat.\n  \n  \n    Lend Some Of Your Crypto To Earn Interest\n\n    You can use smart contracts to lend out some of your cryptocurrency and earn a small amount of interest on it. You can choose how much you want to charge for lending so that you can receive more rewards on future transactions.\n\n    This method is reasonably safe if you're careful about whom you decide to loan with.\n  \n\n\nConclusion\n\nThere are a few different ways to earn rewards with cryptocurrency.\n\nUsing it for everyday transactions lets you get discounts and bonuses from various sources. You can also invest in it, join a pool, or participate in bounty programs to increase your earnings.\n",

On sites like Amazon, paying in crypto can be a great way to save money with tools like Purse.io as crypto payments often come with cashback deals.\n  \n  \n    Traveling\n\n    You can use crypto for travel by trading it for a local currency where you're going or by using a local Bitcoin ATM. This eliminates the need to carry around large amounts of cash.\n  \n  \n    Alternative Savings Account\n\n    You can store your crypto in a digital wallet app like Exodus or in a hardware wallet like Ledger or Trezor.\n\n    Depending on the type of cryptocurrency, this may allow you to not only build a personal savings account but possibly also to earn additional passive income via staking directly from your wallet.\n  \n  \n    Speculation\n\n    Cryptocurrency prices can be extremely volatile and some people enjoy speculating on those price movements. When done systematically, this can be very profitable, but many trade with tiny amounts of money just for fun.\n  \n  \n    Betting\n\n    You can spend crypto to bet on sports or other events. Many long established online sportsbooks have started accepting Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies over the past few years. Sport crypto betting can be a fun way to use your knowledge of the sport to make some extra money.\n  \n  \n    Content Monetization\n\n    An alternative to display advertising, blog platforms like Steemit and Publish0x pay writers crypto rewards to incentivize them both to publish content and to interact with other publishers.\n  \n  \n    File Storage\n\n    You can pay for remote storage services like Sia (for cloud storage) and Storj (for file hosting), using either fiat or cryptocurrency.\n\n    These decentralized networks provide better security than traditional cloud storage services and tend to be cheaper as well.\n  \n\n\nIn Conclusion\n\nThere are many ways you can use cryptocurrency beyond just holding and waiting until you get dollar-rich.\n\nEspecially in online-based services like digital marketing, e-commerce, gaming and betting, cryptocurrencies are now firmly among the default payment options.\n",

If you think the price of an asset will grow at some point within the next 1-10 years, you are long-term bullish.\n\nIf you want to put your money where your bullish sentiment is, but you do not want to waste time trying to get the perfect entry price^TM, you want DCA.\n\nWith DCA, you scale into your position by making small regular purchases. You can use the same step-by-step method to exit the market as well.\n\n\n  More on the method: ATNET Strategy &gt; DCA\n  How does a bot help: To make sure you still buy even if the price is moving up (too expensive!1) or moving down (going to zero!1)\n  Where to get the bot:\n    \n      (Australia) Independent Reserve\n      (non-US world) FTX\n      (US) Coinrule\n    \n  \n  How much does the bot cost: Nada, with the exception of Coinrule\n  Auto-DCA Recipes &amp; Templates:\n    \n      (Australia) Independent Reserve recipe\n      (non-US world) FTX recipe\n      (US) Coinrule recipe\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nTrading bots for TA Strategies\n\nTA, or technical analysis, has a number of pattern trading strategies that can be executed pretty much automatically.\n\nEspecially with short term techniques like scalping, the human factors of emotions, stress and mental fatigue can work very much against you.\n\nExamples of TA classics that can be automated\n\n\n  Scalping the Bollinger bands: Buying at the bottom line touch, selling the top line touch.\n  MACD crosses: Buy on bullish cross, sell on bearish cross on shorter timeframes.\n  RSI, oscillators and their derived transformations: Buy on oversold or other bullish signal, sell on overbought or other bearish signal on shorter timeframes.\n\n\nOf course you can keep trading alt coins directly from your cryptocurrency exchange, if you want to.\n\nBut short term trading is mentally draining to most people. With an automated strategy you can still participate in the market with limited babysitting of your positions.\n\n\n  More on the method: ATNET Glossary &gt; TA\n  How does a bot help: Automation will minimise the time spent on sitting at your desk watching charts.\n  Where to get the bot: Coinrule for no-code solution\n  How much does the bot cost: Free for volumes below 3K USD per month, or 25% off with this link.\n\n\n\n  \n    Coinrule - TECHNICAL ANALYSIS, NO CODING - (free/premium)\n\n    Coinrule bot lets you automate TA-based strategies with no coding knowledge required.\n\n    The interface is user friendly and intuitive, you are just moving around boxes.

Shrimpy provides a range of ready-made portfolio management strategies such as rebalancing, dollar-cost averaging (DCA), and portfolio-wide stop-loss.\n\n    Executing more complex trading strategies on Shrimpy will require Python coding.

This happens because most people submit their lending offers manually. They want to make sure their offer gets filled and try to front run the best ask.\n\nIn margin lending, you will get better lending yield if you let your lending execute automatically.\n\nBasic automation with Bitfinex Lending PRO\n\nBitfinex recently rolled out the “Lending PRO” interface that is available in the web interface from the top menu under “Lending”.\n\nYou can set your minimum acceptable rate there, let’s say 0.009 per 3 days at BTC lending market. Your lending wallet balance will be automatically offered when the rates are above that level.\n\nYou will not be tempted to get “at least something” when the rates have momentarily dropped to ridiculously low levels just during the two minutes you are checking them.\n\n\n  More on the method: ATNET Strategy &gt; Lending\n  How does a bot help: Automatically offers your lending wallet balance for the best possible rate as long as the current rate gets above your minimal required rate.\n  Where to get the bot: Bitfinex\n  How much does the bot cost: Nada\n\n\n\n",

      title: "5 Tips: How to Buy Crypto In Canada (incl. Tax Reference)",
      content: "Though there’s still some uncertainty surrounding cryptocurrency, there’s no denying that cryptocurrency has a place in a country’s economic system. This became even more apparent when the US and many other countries gave way for investors to circulate cryptocurrency in the financial market. Moreover, just recently, the US adopted crypto as a legal tender along with the US dollar.\n\nWhile Canada has yet to do the same, one cannot deny that crypto is quite a popular topic in the country. But unfortunately, the regulations surrounding crypto are a bit dubious at the moment. For that reason, buying crypto in Canada might turn out to be a challenge.\n\nHowever, if you’re planning on going through with your decision, the following tips should help streamline your transaction:\n\n\n  \n    Prepare everything you need beforehand\n\n    Before you can take part in any cryptocurrency transaction, you must first create an account in a crypto exchange. Though not all platforms require credentials from users, you'll most definitely stumble upon several ones that do. That's precisely why you must prepare everything you need to create an account before starting with the process.\n\n    Here's what you may need:\n\n    \n      Your Canadian passport, driver's license, or any other acceptable ID\n      A bank account where you can withdraw and deposit Canadian dollars\n      A mobile device that you can use for two-factor authentication (2FA). 2FA may not be a requirement, but it's an excellent way to maximize the security of your platform.\n      A private internet connection\n    \n\n    Although it’s a basic step, not many people are aware of its importance when buying crypto in Canada. Not only does it speed up the transaction, but you can also prevent any issues that may arise due to a delay in registration. If you want to delve deeper into the steps involved when buying any type of cryptocurrency, you might want to look into Coinformant or other reputable sources for some in-depth guides. [1]\n  \n  \n    Look for a crypto exchange platform registered in Canada\n\n    Now that you have all the documents you need to buy crypto, the next step would be to look for a crypto exchange. Keep in mind that specific platforms may not comply with Canada’s rules and regulations on digital currencies. For that reason, refrain from choosing just about any exchange.\n\n    What you should look for is an exchange that’s registered in Canada. That way, you can be certain that the platform is in compliance with the policies of Canada when it comes to crypto.\n  \n  \n    Dispose of your crypto only when necessary\n\n    A common mistake people make when buying crypto is that they often sell it pointlessly.\n\n    For example, suppose you buy USD$5,000 worth of digital coins in Exchange A but then decide to use Exchange B. In such cases, one solution you may think of is selling the crypto immediately after purchasing it so you can get your money back. You'll then proceed to Exchange B and purchase the crypto there, perhaps because it has better rates and terms.\n\n    While it may seem like you didn't lose anything from this transaction, you actually did. This is because, much like most assets, cryptocurrency is taxable, but only under certain circumstances.\n\n    In this particular scenario, crypto is taxable once you dispose of it. Otherwise, there are no tax implications if you simply hold or buy cryptocurrency.\n\n    ‘Disposing’ may refer to the following:\n\n    \n      Selling a cryptocurrency on any platform\n      Gifting the cryptocurrency to any individual\n      Exchanging your crypto with another cryptocurrency\n      Converting the cryptocurrency to a government-issued currency, like Canadian dollars\n      Use cryptocurrency to purchase other goods or services\n    \n\n    By going through the transaction mentioned earlier, you'll be incurring a certain amount of tax without achieving anything. That’s why you must dispose of your crypto coins only when necessary. [2]\n\n    For example, if there's an emergency requiring money, like an accident. Otherwise, hold your crypto as long as possible or until you can sell it for more money, which begs the question, 'How do you hold onto your crypto?'\n  \n  \n    Have a crypto wallet/storage ready before your purchase\n\n    Much like how you'd store your money on online payment platforms, like PayPal, you must also hold onto your crypto in a specific platform. This platform is what they call a crypto wallet. [3]\n\n    It should be pretty easy to look for one on the internet. As for registration, you simply have to enter your desired login credentials, much like how you would when creating social media accounts.\n\n    Naturally, since you plan to buy crypto in Canada, you need to have a wallet to store it. In this case however, a crypto wallet doesn’t need to be a product of a company registered in Canada.\n\n    \n      A popular free-of-charge wallet is an app called Exodus, which also has staking and NFT capabilities.\n      A popular commercial wallet is Ledger Nano X, likewise supporting staking and NFTs.\n    \n\n    Commercial wallets have a bit better level of security, but they are not necessary if you can keep your computer virus-free.\n  \n  \n    Avoid doing anything that may constitute business activity\n\n    The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) treats crypto much like it would any other commodity.\n\n    So, income that comes from cryptocurrency transactions may be taxable either as a business income, if the transaction involves a business activity, or as capital gains, if it doesn't.\n\n    Here's a look at what a business activity may look like:\n\n    \n      You purchased the cryptocurrency for commercial reasons\n      You performed the transaction in a businesslike manner\n      You obtained the crypto by or while promoting a product or service\n      You intend to make a profit from cryptocurrency in the long term\n    \n\n    Generally, it's advisable to avoid any of these since that may mean you'll have to pay business income tax. So, why does it matter if your transaction yields a capital gain or business income?\n\n    For starters, the tax rate for these two types of profit is different. The average business income tax rate in Canada is 12%, though this may vary from province to province. Meanwhile, the capital gains tax rate in the country may range from 10% to 30%. Again, the rate may vary according to your employment income (higher income = higher tax rate) and the province. [4]\n\n    While the capital gains tax rate is indeed significantly higher in most cases than the business income tax rate, it's important to note that in Canada, only 50% of your capital gains are taxable. So, having to pay capital gains tax is much better as it's most likely going to be lower.\n\n    Suppose you buy crypto worth USD$10,000 and sell it several months later for USD$50,000. If the transaction constitutes a business activity, you have to pay a corporate tax with a rate of around 12%, resulting in a USD$4,800 tax from the earnings of USD$40,000. On the other hand, if it wasn't a business activity, you must use the capital tax gains rate of around 20%. [4]\n\n    Since you only have to count half of USD$40,000 (USD$20,000) as taxable gains, you'll only have to pay a tax of USD$4,000 for this particular transaction, so you're effectively saving USD$800.\n\n    In conclusion, when buying crypto in Canada, you’d want to make it, so the transaction doesn’t involve any business activity for it to yield capital gains tax rather than business income tax.\n  \n\n\nFinal words\n\nThis post explained how to buy cryptocurrency in Canada with full AML/KYC and how to make sense of the various taxation rates that you might incur.\n\nIf you plan to buy crypto as a Canadian, this is all you need to know to go ahead with your buy-and-hold plan.\n\nWhile crypto trading is indeed profitable, one must also remember that there’s a potential for losses. That’s precisely why not everyone who engages in this activity ends up with significant profits at the end of the day. However, with these tips, you can at least prevent issues that may hinder your success rate.\n\nNote - This is a blog post meant as an overview sourced from portals listed below.

      content: "TradingView is an invaluable tool for us traders, and that even in its free-forever version.\n\nHere’s a quick guide on how to set up your TradingView chart so that it shows multiple markets in the same window.\n\nIf you’re not aware of the multichart feature and you’re not sure why you’d want to use it, you’ll learn that at the end of the article.\n\nThe multichart setup is available for every TradingView user, even those on a free plan.\n\nHow to set up Tradingview to show multiple charts\n\n\n  \n    Click the ‘+’ icon in top left corner\n\n    Load a chart layout with the main market - usually the main market of your trading focus.\n\n    Next to the market ticker in the top left corner, there’s a ‘+’ icon. Click it.\n\n    \n  \n  \n    Search the ticker you want to add\n\n    The ‘+’ icon opens a dialog where you can search all markets available on TradingView.\n\n    Find the ticker you want to add and point the cursor on it: I am choosing the CIX ticker, which is the Crypto 100 Index.\n\n    \n  \n  \n    Select ‘new pane’\n\n    When you hover your cursor over a ticker, 3 buttons show up for you to choose in which way to add that market.\n\n    Click on ‘new pane’.\n\n    \n  \n  \n    You now have a line chart in a new pane\n\n    This is what it will look like by default:\n\n    \n\n    You can resize your panes as you like by dragging the edges.\n  \n  \n    Optional: Change to a candlesticks chart\n\n    To change to the candlesticks chart, to which you are probably used to, click the cog icon:\n\n    \n\n    Change the setting from ‘Line’ to ‘Candlesticks’:\n\n    \n  \n  \n    Optional: Add technical indicators, scripts and strategies\n\n    Your newly added chart pane has access to the same TradingView script library as all TradingView charts.\n\n    Click the three dots (obscured in the picture) and select ‘Add indicator’ to access the library of technical indicators.\n\n    \n\n    If you’re uninspired and don’t know what indicator to add, pick something from the free scripts we reviewed in ScriptSpotlight.\n  \n  \n    Final Setup: A Tradingview window with multiple charts\n\n    Make a free account at TradingView to try it out and maybe do some good market timing analysis.\n\n    \n  \n\n\nWhat to use TradingView multi chart layout for\n\nHaving multiple charts stacked on top of each other is the best way to set up for market timing analysis.\n\nIn market timing, we compare the performance of a single market with the performance of the industry represented by a basket index.\n\nSo, in crypto, you’d have to compare for instance ETHUSD with some USD-based basket of cryptocurrencies. There are a few of these indexes around - CCI30 is a good one, but not very easily available.\n\nSticking with TradingView, you’ll get a decent choice of indexes right on the platform:\n\n  CIX (CRYPTOINDEX 100), which is the top 100 crypto coins, continuously rebalanced.\n    \n      Here is the TradingView chart of CIX.\n      Index methodology can be found at cix100.com.\n    \n  \n  FTX index perps of various altcoin groups:\n    \n      The Dragon index for Asian cryptos\n      An index for mid-cap cryptos, which are basically dino alts\n      An index for small low-cap cryptos\n      An index for exchange tokens like BNB, and so on.\n      Composition of FTX indexes is in their docs and the code for 5% fee off is altcointrading.\n    \n  \n\n\nThe best choice of index for market timing purposes is the CIX.\n\nIt’s the largest basket and TradingView has it available as plain index, not as a perpetual swap of an index.\n\nThe basic market timing is done just by visual comparison of the two candlesticks charts on top of each other. Tradingview automatically aligns them candle by candle on the same timeframe, which is handy.\n\nHere is what it looks like with the CIX index:\n\n\n\n\n  The index represents the price action of the industry as a whole.\n  The single market chart shows whether your market has stronger or weaker runs than the industry in general.\n  To make the visual comparison easier, you can draw support and resistance or high volume areas into both charts. Then see if both the market and the industry index crossed them.\n  You can also use indicators that overlay price action on both charts.\n    \n      Bollinger bands will help you judge which chart declined relatively lower in its bottoms, or peaked relatively higher: It’s about the distance of the extreme from the band.\n      Fib retracements can also help judge the strength of the market vs industry: In retracements, the stronger market will bounce sooner.\n    \n  \n\n\nFinally, I will not miss the opportunity to note that in Wyckoff speak, to see if a single market moves stronger or weaker than an index is to say whether it is a leader or a laggard.\n\nThere are certain benefits in trading or at least following the leaders, such as that they often top out first.\n\n\n  If you want read more on market timing, we’ve got a strategy post on that.\n\n",

      title: "How to Identify Cryptocurrencies Worth Investing In: 5 Beginner Tips",
      content: "Knowing which cryptocurrency is worth investing in may be challenging now that literal thousands of them are on the market.\n\nSo, if you're a newbie investor, you may want to buy cryptos that can generate huge returns. While this is possible, you should also consider that crypto investing isn't a quick-rich scheme.\n\nIt requires the strategies, effort, emotional control and time to make your investment gain traction.\n\nEither way, even while you're getting started, you may want to consider the following tips when choosing the cryptos to buy:\n\n\n  \n    Check The Revenue\n\n    The first is to understand the crypto's economic impact or revenue model. The crypto should have solutions or aims to generate some money or solve problems for its ecosystem. That's because it's a financial asset, after all. From startups to partners, node operators to miners, their objectives should positively impact such ecosystems.\n\n    For instance, Bitcoin aims to let anyone from across the world pay using such crypto. It makes payment quicker and less expensive than those conventional payment methods in the bank or Government. This means that such a payment scheme could be one of the preferred ways of making it worth an investment.\n\n    There are other cryptos with a good objective, and you can find them on most crypto trading platforms and top copy trading bots.\n  \n  \n    Learn More About Fundamental Analysis\n\n    Here, you need to understand the crypto's foundations, including their strengths, ambitions, and team. The information about these fundamentals will help you gauge if crypto has a good investment potential for the long term.\n\n    Also, this is essential to know if the asset is undervalued or overvalued. Most traders can conclude that crypto has a trading opportunity if the fundamental analysis shows that its current market price differs from its fair market value. You're more likely to buy such crypto because it's undervalued. But if it's overvalued, then selling it is the best strategy.\n  \n  \n    Spread The Risk\n\n    Your crypto choices should also consider risk because some cryptos are more volatile than others, it's best to diversify your risk. This means buying stable cryptos, such as Bitcoin, the oldest digital currency, making it the safest bet for crypto investors.\n\n    The other cryptos are called altcoins, and some of them may also be stable cryptos. These include XRP, LTC, ETH, and the like. Buying them will help you balance your portfolio. Also, this means you can buy coins that are still new, but their volatility is higher.\n\n    Volatile cryptos' prices can suddenly go high or low, so they're also good. However, it's still best to keep them at a minimum percentage.\n  \n  \n    Check The Market Capitalization\n\n    Most importantly, you should check crypto's market capitalization, which indicates an asset's market value, popularity, and dominance.\n\n    Experts say that safe crypto investment is large-cap cryptocurrencies. “Large-cap” means their market cap is worth more than USD$10 billion. Although these cryptos are usually more volatile than stocks and other traditional assets, such coins are still less volatile and less risky than most altcoins.\n\n    You may also want to consider mid-cap cryptos. They have more growth potential than large-cap cryptos, but they're also more volatile than them.\n\n    Meanwhile, small-cap cryptos have higher risk and are highly volatile than mid-and large-cap coins. Although they may have a lot of growth potential, this may only be for the short term. This means they could crash from one minute to the next, so it's best to invest only a little of your assets if you want to.\n  \n  \n    Trading Volume\n\n    However, the market cap doesn't let you understand the crypto's actual trading volumes over the last hours. Thus, you should also check the crypto's 24-hour trading volume.\n\n    Trading volume is vital to gauge the coin's health. You can use this with other metrics, such as market cap, to check the crypto's potential for success. The higher the volume is, the more popular it's in the market since it shows how many people are selling or buying the coin. Knowing such numbers can help you identify a potential breakout in its price. Also, this can indicate a possible change in trend, such as bullish or bearish, allowing you to establish your trading position.\n  \n\n\nConclusion\n\nIn the crypto world, there is a lot of complexity that might be harder to decipher. So, investing in cryptos can be profitable if you know which coins to buy. Before doing so, you first need to consider the tips above. That way, you can avoid putting your assets in coins that may not give you profits in the long run.\n",

      title: "Altcoins In Australia: Trading Tips And Tricks",
      content: "If you're interested in cryptocurrencies, you've heard about bitcoin vs altcoins.\n\nBitcoin is the major and the first cryptocurrency. On the other hand, altcoins are all the other cryptocurrencies apart from bitcoin. The other cryptocurrencies include Ethereum, Litecoin, dogecoin, among others. After many people missed the early stages of investing in Bitcoin, altcoins were created as an alternative.\n\nIn Australia, these altcoins are popular because they're affordable and more volatile, and their prices rise at a higher rate than bitcoin. Hence, traders have better chances of making quick profits.\n\nBut because altcoins are volatile, there's also a higher risk of realizing losses just as fast as making profits. That's why traders should have some tips and tricks in their arsenal when trading altcoins. Here are some of them:\n\n\n  \n    Choose a reliable cryptocurrency exchange\n\n    There are many cryptocurrency exchanges in Australia that traders can use. But that doesn't mean you should sign up for all of them. Instead, you should research reliable Aussie crypto exchanges and choose the ones that suit you the best.\n\n    Here are some of the considerations to make when choosing a crypto exchange:\n\n    \n      \n        Trading fees and commissions: As you expect, there are always fees involved every time you buy or sell an altcoin on an exchange platform. Some exchanges charge a flat fee per trade, while others have a percentage-based structure. Ideally, you'll want to choose an exchange with low trading fees and commissions.\n      \n      \n        Payment methods: The payment methods available through each exchange vary greatly in Australia. Some allow you to buy cryptocurrency using cash or a credit/debit directly from the website. Others require you to connect with a third-party service. So, choose the one that has a deposit method that you prefer.\n      \n      \n        Liquidity: Another important factor to check is the liquidity of the exchange. As a trader, you need an exchange that allows you to buy and sell altcoins easily. Therefore, the exchange should be highly liquid. (1)\n      \n    \n\n    With a reliable crypto exchange platform, you can quickly enter and exit positions, buy crypto, and be assured of your funds' security.\n  \n  \n    Do your research\n\n    You need to learn everything there is to know about the altcoin that you want to buy before investing in it. Check out the company's website, read its whitepaper, and listen to what their team says about their product. Ensure the company has a solid plan and an experienced team behind its project. (2)\n\n    Also, you must keep track of the price movements of all the altcoins that you own or want to buy. There are many market scanners and websites where you can monitor price changes for different altcoins. You can set up alerts for when the price rises above or falls below certain points and see how different cryptos stack up against each other over time. (2)\n  \n  \n    Buy the dips\n\n    'Buying the dips' is a strategy that's commonly used in stock and crypto markets. It involves buying an asset when it's low and waiting for it to rise. In the world of cryptocurrency, there are usually two types of dips.\n\n    \n      \n        Daily Dips: These occur when Bitcoin's value drops and altcoins follow suit. The idea behind 'buy the dips' is that bitcoins will recover from this short-term dip, while altcoins may not. Thus, if you buy altcoins before they recover, you can profit from them once their prices rise.\n      \n      \n        Long-Term Dips: These are more serious and occur over several days or weeks. Usually, these drops happen shortly after a new coin has been announced or launched on the market. People who buy altcoins during these dips have a higher chance of profiting later. (3)\n      \n    \n\n    However, buying a dip doesn't mean that the coin will recover immediately. The only catch is that cryptocurrencies have a history of recovering from dips. So, you can hold the altcoins for long until the price recovers.\n  \n  \n    Diversify your portfolio\n\n    The best way to avoid losing money is to diversify your cryptocurrency portfolio (don't put your eggs in a single basket). Instead of investing all your money into a single altcoin, you should choose several different altcoins, each representing a small percentage of your overall savings.\n\n    This strategy has several advantages:\n\n    \n      It reduces the level of risk. If one investment performs poorly, you still have others that might do well.\n      It also makes it easier for investors to decide where they want to put their money next. If they lose interest in one currency, they can put their money into another one that's trending at the time.\n      It allows traders to take advantage of new opportunities as they arise without selling their current investments first. (4)\n    \n\n    If the altcoins perform differently in the market, you can take the gains as you wait for the others to recover.\n  \n  \n    Use risk mitigation tools\n\n    The cryptocurrency market is highly volatile, and even experienced traders can get caught by price fluctuations. It may seem difficult to predict the direction in which an Altcoin will move, but some strategies can help minimize losses and maximize profits, like the following:\n\n    \n      \n        Stop-loss orders: A stop-loss order is a sell order that'll automatically execute as soon as a specific price point is reached. This means that if the price drops below a certain point, the trade will end automatically. You need to set up the order before you start trading to protect your investment.\n      \n      \n        Take-profit orders: The idea behind take-profit orders is similar to stop-loss orders but with the opposite effect. If you buy into a coin with the expectation that it'll go up in value, a take-profit order will automatically execute a sale whenever the coin reaches a certain price point. (5)\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nConclusion\n\nAltcoins may not be as stable as bitcoin, so trading them can be riskier but more profitable. In Australia, you can use the available crypto exchanges and brokerage accounts to purchase the altcoins and trade for profits. But you need to familiarize yourself with the trading tricks and tips discussed in the article, such as mitigating losses, diversifying your portfolio, and researching to maximize your earnings.\n\nReferences\n\n\n  \"11 Things to Look for in a Cryptocurrency Exchange\", Source: https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/buying-stocks/articles/11-things-to-look-for-in-a-cryptocurrency-exchange/\n  \"What Are Altcoins and Should You Invest In Them?\", Source: https://money.usnews.com/investing/investing-101/articles/what-are-altcoins-and-should-you-invest-in-them\n  \"Buy The Dips\", Source: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/buy-the-dips.asp\n  \"Six cryptocurrency tips (and five mistakes to avoid)\", Source: https://www.thetimes.co.uk/money-mentor/article/crypto-tips-mistakes/\n  \"What is Stop Loss (SL) and Take Profit (TP) and how to use it?\", Source: https://www.axiory.com/trading-resources/trading-terms/stop-loss-take-profit\n\n",

      title: "Tiered Crypto Storage: How to do it right (Reworked for 2022)",
      content: "The idea of “tiered crypto storage” was first popularised by Andreas Antonopoulos.\n\nTiered storage in short refers to a crypto cold storage setup where you use several computers or mobile phones to store your cryptocurrency on.\n\nThe security is then enhanced by your behavior:\n\n\n  You will never use a device with a lot of crypto on it for daily browsing and downloading.\n  You will use a device with tiny amount of crypto for that.\n\n\nThis split is what makes your storage tiered.\n\nIt does mean taking extra steps. But there is no benefit in user-friendly processes if they involve large amounts of money. Why would you want to make that kind of thing easy?\n\nWhy a tiered system when we have hardware wallets?\n\nIn principle, separating your activities per device is what hardware wallets do. A hardware wallet like Ledger is a single-purpose device that can only store crypto and nothing else.\n\nThe problem with hardware wallets is that they are a black box type of commercial products. Every hardware wallet stores your private key on it, and it has been demonstrated that the seed can be retrieved under certain conditions.\n\nWhile the sourcing of hardware is as questionable in case of laptops and phones as it is in hardware wallets, using a custom solution at least gives you an extra layer of security.\n\n\n  Everyone knows what a hardware wallet looks like, everyone knows whats on it.\n  Every hardware wallet accessed physically and flashed with a malicious firmware version will give away the private keys.\n  Scripts to hack popular setups are a commodity that is sold in bulk and doesn’t require technical skills.\n  Hacking a custom solution requires far more knowledge and experience.\n\n\nDo you absolutely have to do a tiered storage?\n\nThe answer is no.\n\nFor some it’s not much of an inconvenience to have separate devices for different activities, but the truth is it is pretty technical way to go about things.\n\nThe next best thing is is to split your holdings over several crypto wallets. In 2022 we can already choose from a pretty good range:\n\n\n  Coldcard is a Bitcoin-only hardware wallet that is specifically focused on security as well as privacy. If you are diversifying your wallets, you should not leave Coldcard out.\n  Trezor One is not a good choice, but the new Trezor T models have been overhauled in some pretty major ways. They store your private key split in parts, not as a single piece of text, which is a good security enhancement.\n  Ledger is obviously the most popular crypto wallet, and also one that has better score in terms of security than Trezor. Since 2022 they have a device called Nano Plus, which is affordable like the old Nano but has enough memory to hold 100+ altcoin and NFT apps.\n\n\nStoring your crypto in parts on all three of these will lower your losses in case of the (unlikely) incidents like having a malicious firmware update distributed through the official channels.\n\nStoring your crypto on multiple devices of the same type can be helpful in times of robberies of burglaries - the criminal is likely to leave with the first wallet they find, as long as you don’t store all your wallets together.\n\nTiered devices for for cryptocurrencies\n\nThere are four tiers - the cold, warm, hot and beater devices.\n\n\n  \n    The cold device\n\n    A cold wallet is where cryptocurrency holders store coins they are planning to hold for multiple years.\n\n    A cold device, the device that carries cold wallet, is not to be used for your normal day to day work. It is an offline, so called “air-gapped” device.\n\n    It had its disk scrubbed and OS reinstalled before the cold wallet came on to it.\n\n    It does not connect to the internet, not even to make a transaction.\n\n    The technically simplest type of cold device is a “paper wallet”: Your private key written down is an item that will always stay offline. (Paper doesn’t last, use steel to do this.)\n\n    The classic crypto geek way of setting up a cold device is by air-gapping a laptop - more on that further down.\n  \n  \n    The warm device\n\n    Warm device is a dedicated device that you use for handling cryptocurrencies, but it gets online sometimes. While you don’t go to any dangerous parts of the internet, you still cannot be sure if the device is safe or not, because it connects to the internet.\n\n    Once connected to the internet, you wouldn’t know if it didn’t download any malicious file perhaps through a background process you were not aware of.\n\n    Commercial hardware wallets are warm devices: Their user interfaces are full of frills that communicate with remote destinations that can potentially be poisoned.\n  \n  \n    The hot device\n\n    Hot wallet is a cryptocurrency wallet that lives on a device that is connected to the internet most of the times.\n\n    Crypto traders have their trading stash in hot wallets like Exodus or Metamask. It’s convenient, easy to use, connects to DEX apps through your browser.\n\n    These wallets should not store major part of your crypto.\n\n    If you are crypto trader, use 2FA and have at least a trading computer and a beater computer. Multi factor auth can be breached too, so use your trading computer just for trading and don’t expose it to any extra dangers.\n  \n  \n    The beater device\n\n    A beater device is a laptop, smartphone or tablet that you use for all of your risky activities.\n\n    These include visiting untrusted websites, watching p0rn or sports streams on dodgy websites and browsing sites with loads of ads that often carry viruses. Downloading movies or pirated software belongs here too.\n\n    Your beater device should not store any cryptocurrency wallets. You shouldn’t use it to log into crypto exchanges, in case there’s a keylogger. You shouldn’t use a beater device to log into mailboxes that you signed up with at crypto exchanges.\n  \n\n\n\n\nMaking a custom Bitcoin cold storage\n\nFirst off, cold storage is pretty much a Bitcoin-only thing. Alt coin projects do not focus on privacy and security nearly as much as on user-friendliness. Sadly, software needed to set up a cold storage typically does not exist for alt coins.\n\nBut if you are a crypto holder, especially a large one, willing to long-term hold Bitcoin, here is why a real cold storage matters:\n\n\n  A cold wallet is a Bitcoin wallet on a computer that never gets connected to the internet.\n  In Bitcoin wallets like Electrum, you can create and sign a transaction out of your wallet even if the wallet is offline.\n  To broadcast the transaction, you need to plug it into a different wallet on a “warm” computer that is online. A dedicated USB stick is used for this.\n  Since the transaction is already signed when it reaches the online device, your private key is not involved in any action on the online computer.\n  Because the private key never reaches an online device, it cannot be stolen: Neither through software nor through hardware holes.\n\n\nWhat is the security score?\n\nWell, the only way your private key would ever get stolen could be if somebody stole your air-gapped laptop.\n\nThey’d first need to have the information that the laptop is worth stealing and hacking into. Then they’d need to find a way to log into your user account, find the crypto wallet, obtain your decrypt password and then expose the private keys.\n\nThis is the same risk that exists with hardware wallets, except the custom solution is not standard and would require lots of professional experience on part of the hacker.\n\nContrary to that, scripts targeting common devices are a commodity. They can be bought as stock, set up in such a way that no technical skills are needed. This is how majority of cyber attacks is launched these days - they run on commodity scripts.\n\nSoftware wallet on an offline computer\n\nBack in the day, bitcoiners used to use Bitcoin Armory as their cold storage solution, but these days you should use Electrum for your cold storage. Armory is outdated.\n\nElectrum is a super simple non-commercial wallet that doesn’t have any of the shiny UX features you’ll get with wallets like Exodus, Ledger or Trezor.\n\nBut for the purpose of a cold wallet, no frill is exactly what you want.\n\n\n  Electrum bitcoin wallet provides a step-by-step guide on how to set up a cold storage with it here are the official docs.\n  CryptoCompare has a guide on how to do an offline transaction in Bitcoin Electrum.\n\n\nHere is also an old tutorial on how to use a Raspberry Pi for cold storage that is still valid, perhaps with minor adjustments since the hardware got better.\n\nBottom line\n\nIf you have it in you to split your online activities at least between a “work device” and a “beater device”, I recommend going through with it. The benefits over the long run are beyond doubt.\n\nIf you don’t want to deal with geeky Linuxy things at all, at least split your holdings between several wallets.\n\nOut of the commercial hardware wallets, the Bitcoin Coldcard is the best choice in terms of privacy and security.\n",

      title: "How to buy, trade or stake Tezos in 2022",
      content: "Tezos is a business-oriented blockchain that runs on the Proof-of-Stake algo and sports higher security of smart contracts, code standards good for mission critical industries and support from the international business community.\n\nIn this post, we will look at the best places to buy or trade Tezos.\n\nFurther down we’ll get into all you need to know about the Tezos in 2022 - it developed quite a bit since its launch in 2018.\n\nWhere to buy Tezos\n\n\n  US and EU The safest place to purchase Tezos from the US and EU is the Kraken exchange.\n  UAE Don’t miss this opportunity you are looking to buy Tezos in UAE.\n  APAC If you are in Singapore or thereabouts, Phemex is the best exchange for you.\n\n\nIf you are looking to buy Tezos with no KYC, you can do so on the smaller Hong-Kong outfit Bitforex or more traditionally at Bitfinex.\n\nFor contract trading and Tezos derivatives, your best platform is FTX.com which runs Tezos perps, Tezos futures and markets for TEZOSBEAR/TEZOSBULL contracts. There is no spot market for XTZ, however.\n\nAs for staking Tezos, Bitfinex stakes your XTZ Exchange wallet deposits for you automatically. Other than that, Tezos staking is available in Exodus, Ledger and other common staking wallets.\n\nAll you need to know about Tezos\n\nFor all the crypto and blockchain enthusiasts out there who haven’t heard about Tezos when it first launched, Tezos is a decentralized blockchain platform of the kind that in fintech circles is called ecosystem.\n\nTezos was developed with the purpose to store and transfer digitized assets with less overhead and administrative costs than is still common in most industries - cross-border finance, international trade, heavy industries, you name it.\n\nAdditionally, one of the key features of the whole platform operations is the innovative governance system, which Tezos distributes among the people who hold the coins.\n\nAny changes in the codebase of the Tezos platform are an open subject for the community. It is the holders of the coin who need to evaluate and approve any new developments and implementations. So, the platform is directly lead by the active part of the community of the users. This is an experimental collaborative approach, but the Tezos platform bets on it with its own future.\n\n\n  \n    Blockchain work dynamics\n\n    So, Tezos is an ecosystem.\n\n    The Tezos blockchain is a custom-made blockchain, incompatible with the likes of Bitcoin or Ethereum.  The cryptocurrency token of Tezos blockchain is called XTZ (Tez).\n\n    Tezos runs on the Proof-of-Stake mechanism. That means you can stake Tez to yield passive income. Tezos staking is available in Exodus, Ledger and other staking wallets and is quite popular.\n\n    It also means that Tezos is more eco-friendly than most blockchains, which is important for the following two points.\n  \n  \n    Potential use of Tezos\n\n    Tezos was the brainchild of two international trade professionals. No surprise that it is designed to provide the quality and security standards that are required in industries that serve public infrastructure and military.\n\n    From the start, the project was build around the practices common in mission-critical industries like aerospace or semiconductor.\n\n    This is also where the application of Tezos should be sought. The time is perhaps not there yet, but when the demand from those industries comes, Tezos will be among the few good candidates to respond to it.\n  \n  \n    Investing in Tezos\n\n    If you haven’t been around for the launch of Tezos in 2018, you have sure missed a spectacle. The promo of the initial coin offering was out of proportion, even though it was just another blockchain in (back then) a few hundred others that already existed.\n\n    Tezos was billed as the alt coin that will make Bitcoin obsolete. So far, that clearly did not happen for either Tezos or the line of other altcoins that were promoted as the same.\n\n    That said, Tezos has been doing quite fine over the years. The community of active users has built up well, business interest exists and as for the future of Tezos, one very positive property of the platform is that it is eco-friendly.\n  \n\n\nFinal Note\n\nThe world of crypto and blockchain is ever-changing. Just a couple of years back, people were sure that the fiat model of finance couldn't be beaten. It seems that the consensus has changed since then. Tezos is playing its part, changing the future of how corporations do business.\n",

      content: "Exodus wallet is one of the most popular free software wallets. It has a killer UI and even better functionalities.\n\n\n  Exodus provides its own cold staking where you won’t get ripped off on fees.\n  You can store NFTs in it (if they are on Solana, they will even render as a visual gallery).\n  Exodus supports tons of currencies and stablecoins on all the usual blockchains.\n  There’s a token swap on board for quick exchanges, but you can also log into your FTX account via Exodus to trade larger and with lower fees.\n\n\nOh and also, Exodus is an independent company, not a subdivision of Binance, which probably makes it a bit more shielded from any undue top-down involvement.\n\nThis how-to post is about a basic but practical function of Exodus, which is portfolio tracking.\n\nPortfolio tracking in Exodus\n\nExodus lets you split your crypto wallet into multiple portfolios.\n\nEach portfolio gets its own set of addresses, so you can be sure that you won’t mingle (let’s say) assets from KYC exchanges and no-KYC exchanges and won’t ever have to use coin control to sell them.\n\nUsing portfolio, you also get a second fiat value reporting: There’s one in the top left corner for your total fiat worth, and one pie chart overview for each portfolio.\n\n\n\nThese two ways of fiat reporting are convenient if you trade or stake, but also long-term hold. Just set up a portfolio for each purpose. This way you’ll see how your net worth moves in each of these income streams.\n\nIt’s super convenient to do this in Exodus because you can cold stake directly from Exodus and you can connect Exodus to your FTX trading account too.\n\n\n  FTX has some of the lowest trading fees for spot trading, so you’re not even paying extra for the convenience.\n\n\nBtw, all of your portfolios are still under the same seed phrase, no need to do anything extra for backups.\n\nHow to start a new portfolio in Exodus\n\nThis guide is for the desktop app, but the mobile Exodus app uses the same icons for navigation.\n\n\n  \n    Open your Exodus wallet and go to “Portfolios”\n\n    In Exodus, you can get to your portfolios from the header tab navigation, or via the right-hand-side menu.\n\n    \n  \n  \n    Click “Create a new portfolio”\n\n    The Portfolios tab lists all your portfolios. If you’ve never created one, you’ll see that all your assets are under the default portfolio “Personal”.\n\n    Click the button to create a new portfolio.\n\n    \n  \n  \n    Choose a name of your portfolio\n\n    Here I went with “Trading”, to create a wallet account for my degenerate hobby.\n\n    All the settings here is just cosmetic, you don’t create any new passphrase or key.\n\n    \n  \n  \n    You’ve created an empty portfolio\n\n    Choose to go see the new portfolio by clicking the button on the right: “Continue to ‘Trading’”.\n\n    \n  \n  \n    Go to your new wallet\n\n    To see the (empty) wallet of your new portfolio, click the wallet tab.\n\n    It will always open the wallet of the portfolio that is indicated in the top right corner.\n\n    If you load, let’s say, your Trading ETH wallet, clicking on the portfolio icon and choosing the Personal portfolio from there will take you directly to the ETH wallet in your Personal portfolio.\n\n    You can navigate this way to select the cryptocurrency to transfer into your new portfolio.\n\n    \n  \n  \n    Transfer funds into your portfolio\n\n    Because portfolios have each their own set of addresses, transferring some of your crypto into the new portfolio involves a regular, fee-paying transactions.\n\n    The advantage is that you don’t need to copy-paste any wallet address to transfer between your own portfolio accounts: Do not use the “Send” button but the one on the left that says “Transfer Funds”.\n\n    \n\n    This way you can transfer crypto between your own portfolios without dealing with your addresses at all.\n\n    \n  \n  \n    Check the transfer in the list of your transactions\n\n    You will get a pop up notification about the transfer right away.\n\n    It is marked as an internal transfer in the list of your transactions as well: No addresses involved, just the icon of the receiving portfolio.\n\n    \n  \n\n\nThat’s all folks\n\nNow you can go ahead and set up cold staking or start trading through FTX.\n\nDon’t forget to use 2FA and a withdrawal whitelist on your FTX account - it’s really important if you access FTX through a third party app.\n",

      title: "Cashing out of crypto in Dubai: How to do it with less fees",
      content: "Cryptocurrency has become a popular investment choice for digital natives, but you can't exactly use it to pay for your supper on the daily.\n\nAs in, it can be done if you want to limit yourself to only a handful of options to choose from - not exactly something most of us would decide to do as long as there is an alternative. The vast majority of consumers will decide to convert their crypto into cash before they spend it. The good news is that it's getting easier and cheaper to accomplish.\n\nIn this guide we’ll look at how to cash out of crypto in Dubai. We’ll cover both large and small amounts of crypto.\n\nMain ways to cash-out digital currency in UAE\n\nThere is no shortage of off-ramps from cryptocurrencies into cash these days, which is a great thing. There are various ways to cash out, so just choose the one that best meets your needs.\n\nRegardless of what way you’ll choose, the primary criteria that you should look for in any cash-out intermediary are as follows:\n\n\n  Profits are calculated based on the amount of fiat money exchanged for one cryptocurrency unit\n  High level of trustworthiness, including the secure conversion and transfer of your funds\n  Convenience, i.e. the ease with which the transaction may be completed and the amount of time it takes.\n\n\nIn Dubai, the following are the most common methods for withdrawing cryptocurrency:\n\n\n  Withdrawal of funds through centralized, KYC’d exchanges\n  Using exchange services and P2P markets to convert into cash\n  Web Money payment system - it allows Bitcoin payments, thus you'll need an official WM Passport to setup a WMX wallet\n  Over-the-counter deals (OTC) with private individuals\n\n\nEach option has its own set of benefits and drawbacks, but one drawback is present pretty much acros the board: Money will be usually sent to your credit card. In UAE, you'll have to pay a tax for that, which might be rather substantial in the case of large conversion amounts.\n\nSome other ways of selling cryptocurrency for cash in Dubai can help you reduce your fees and maximize profits on your crypto stash.\n\nCashing out cryptocurrencies in UAE\n\nFrom the point of view of UAE-based business people, the utility value of cryptocurrencies is quite clear.\n\nBig business people and ultra high net worth investors are the most common owners of cryptocurrency accounts. They feel it is better to conduct transactions through offshore accounts, where large sums of money may be moved tax-free.\n\nDue to a variety of characteristics, the UAE is one of the most preferred offshore zones:\n\n\n  The world's most dependable banking system for money safety and security.\n  Cashing out money without restrictions, including transfers from US and Hong Kong exchanges to UAE accounts.\n  Taxes and tax reports are not required of non-residents.\n  Absolute transactional confidentiality.\n  Stable political conditions.\n\n\nYou can use a peer-to-peer platform to convert your digital tokens into cash by simply selling it to another person. The advantages include a smaller fee and the possibility of a better exchange rate compared to a third-party brokerage.\n\nBut it's recommended that you ask for proof of ID and payment proof before releasing your cryptocurrency, especially if you trade with a counterparty for the first time ever.\n\nOTC dealers like Coinsfera make it easier to buy and sell Bitcoin and USDT in Dubai because as companies, their reputation is always on display.\n\nCoinsfera enables buying and selling bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies simple and secure. Whether you're looking to buy or sell bitcoin in UAE, we've got you covered.\n\nCoinsfera charges a modest fee when using cash, and supports four currencies - AED, USD, EUR, and GBP. The process is simple for buying as well as selling.\n\nIf you want to start accepting crypto payments in your business, Coinsfera has a payment gateway and crypto POS machine that is first in the world to support over 100 cryptocurrencies. With a 0% fee, it can be used for global e-commerce and retail all over the world, not just in the UAE.\n\nCrypto Debit Cards in UAE\n\nLast way to mention in this guide on cashing out is crypto banking. In the UAE, it is now possible to get a prepaid bitcoin debit card.\n\nInstead of maintaining your digital coin balance as an investment, you may use it like any other money to make ordinary transactions or withdraw it as cash.\n\nIf you want to conveniently spend your balance, you'll need to create an account with a company that sells cryptocurrency debit cards and utilizes the type of digital currency you hold.\n\nConclusion\n\nBy way of a conclusion, a quick note: Before converting cryptocurrency to cash, think about a few things. Digital tokens are extremely volatile and their values fluctuate frequently, you risk losing money if your timing is off.\n",

The Moonbeam Foundation is a nonprofit that funds and promotes the use of blockchain technology.\n\nWhy does the crypto community invest in MOVR (Moonriver)?\n\nMoonriver is meant to be used as a companion network to Moonbeam.\n\nThat means that MOVR is meant as a so-called canary system: New code will go to Moonriver first, there it will be tested under real-world conditions and only after all functionalities are validated, the code will be deployed to Moonbeam via Polkadot platform.\n\nBecause of this “sandbox” use case of MOVR, transacting, trading and staking this token is highly incetivized. This is what attracts investors and stakers to buy MOVR.\n\nIs there any value in speculating short term on MOVR?\n\nMOVR is one of the small altcoins that trades slightly out of sync with the big cryptocurrencies. See below its comparison with BTC and with the CIX100 crypto index of top 100 coins from TradingView.\n\nAt the price action of late April 2022, it provided the “last breath pump” that sometimes happens in small altcoins in times when big cryptocurrencies are already past the peak of the current cycle.\n\n\n\nBecause of this effect, Moonriver can offer crypto traders a chance to exploit market inefficiencies and profit from the price movements of MOVR.\n\n\n\nHow to stake MOVR coin\n\nMOVR is an ETH-based staking coin and can be staked using MetaMask. Moonbeam network provides an official tutorial on how to add Moonriver token into MetaMask and how to stake it from there.\n\nMOVR can also be staked via AllNodes staking pools.

      content: "\n  Jump to the step-by-step guide on how to buy XMR privately for fiat, without buying other crypto first\n  Jump to the step-by-step guide on how to buy XMR truly anonymously for other large crypto\n\n\nAs you probably know, Monero, or XMR, is the cryptocurrency designed for absolute privacy of transactions.\n\nPeople invest in Monero even though Monero cannot be staked, there is not much lending income on it, the core dev team runs no advertising for Monero nor strike any business partnerships. Additionally, Monero is not always supported by mainstream crypto wallets or exchanges. So, what is the value that Monero investors see in the coin?\n\nMonero’s value proposition is simple: it is private, untraceable and fungible.\n\nWhen we say that Monero is private, we mean that transactions on the Monero blockchain cannot be linked to a specific user - Ever. This is in contrast to Bitcoin, where every transaction is publicly visible on the blockchain and all of your activity can be traced back to you, if you didn’t buy your Bitcoin in a non-KYC way.\n\nMonero removes all this. You cannot link a transaction to a person over more than one hop: If you buy Monero on a KYC exchange and you withdraw it, then that particular transaction is well documented and linked to you. But if you move the coin out of that address, that track is lost. The coin could have been stolen for all you know /s\n\nIf we want to throw around opaque technical jargon, it’s Stealth Addresses, Ring Signatures, and RingCT that make every trace die away after a single hop.\n\nHere’s the practical value of that: Blacklisting XMR that passed through a particular address is impossible. You can outlaw the currency as a whole which is not unimaginable, nonetheless it is not the present day reality.\n\nHere below is the step-by-step guide on buying Monero privately, just directly for fiat money, and as a second guide we’ll go through the more stealthy version which leaves no trace that you bought XMR whatsoever.\n\n\n\nHow to buy Monero privately: Single step from fiat to XMR\n\nSo, there is one place dedicated to trading Monero for cash or online wallet money (or the other way round), and that is LocalMonero.\n\nThe problem with LocalMonero is that it’s basically just a message board where you send private messages with someone. That’s why there’s a link to the “canary message” in the footer: When that message changes, you can safely assume that your private messages on the platform were read by the law.\n\nThere’s a strong relation between XMR and crime, so in some jurisdictions you might get asked a few questions just for a proof that you were buying Monero.\n\nIf you want to buy Monero as an investment or even for speculation, then you are fine though.\n\nHere’s how to do it:\n\n\n  \n    Get a Monero wallet\n\n    The easiest wallet to work with is MyMonero.com - available for desktops and phones.\n  \n  Sign up at LocalMonero\n  \n    Do not post an ad but instead look through the list of vendors.\n\n    LocalMonero will show vendors from your country. Payment methods include national bank transfer, AdvCash, Paypal or cash.\n  \n  \n    If you find a vendor, check if they have good ratings on their profile.\n\n    50+ good trades generally means a reliable vendor.\n  \n  \n    Contact the vendor to negotiate the amount.\n\n    The vendor will most likely ask for your ID and that’s at the discretion of the vendor.\n\n    In this situation, do not send your ID via LocalMonero but ask to send the (watermarked) ID via Telegram or email, mentioning the trade ID in your message to prove you are the same person. This way you will not document yourself right on the platform.\n\n    The vendor should accept it as verifying email of the counterparty is recommended by LocalMonero in case of disputes.\n  \n  \n    Agree on a trade only if it will be executed via LocalMonero.\n\n    The platform has an “arbitration bond” function - essentially an escrow - which protects you from scams.\n\n    When a trade is made, the seller’s LocalMonero wallet is automatically debited with an amount equal to the deal’s value. This means that if the trader runs with your cash and does not finish the transaction, LocalMonero support may direct the money in the arbitration bond to you.\n  \n  \n    Get the coins into your wallet that you set up in the first step.\n  \n  \n    Trade with the same person over again.\n\n    Once you build trust, it is safer to trade small amounts outside of LocalMonero.\n\n    You risk fraud but you save on fees, it’s up to you to decide if that’s worth the risk.\n  \n\n\nOf course, if you don’t care about being KYC’d, you can buy Monero for fiat on Kraken, Binance or Bitfinex too - but trading directly from fiat will need you to get verified there.\n\n\n\nHow to buy Monero with full anonymity: The two-step buying process\n\nThe two-step buying process starts with buying BTC or ETH without KYC.\n\n\n  Step 1 - Buy BTC on a non-KYC platform\n  Step 2 - Trade BTC for XMR on a non-KYC platform that trades XMRBTC - nowadays, you need Bitfinex for that\n\n\n\n  \n    Step 1 - Buy BTC on a zero-knowledge platform\n\n    One of the safest no-KYC alternatives to onramp to crypto are p2p markets like LocalCryptos. They allow exchange between fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies, but have zero knowledge of the details of the transactions, which under the 2022 laws still exempts them from enforcing KYC/AML.\n\n    (There is a law-enforcement push to change that: Financial Times, 7 Feb 2022. If you’re on the fence about onramping, maybe it would be a good idea to make up your mind soon. Just saying.)\n\n    The reason why zero-knowledge is so important in a P2P platform is that when your vendor asks for your ID, you can send it directly through the platform. On LocalCryptos, all your private messages are encrypted, there is no way any of that gets out except when your vendor is actually the law or something.\n\n    In addition to that, LocalCryptos of course have an escrow, so you can open a dispute in case someone doesn’t finish the transaction after you paid.\n  \n  \n    Step 2 - Buying XMR on a non-KYC exchange\n\n    You will need to do this on Bitfinex.\n\n    Open an account, deposit BTC, buy XMR and withdraw XMR.\n\n    Bitfinex does\n    \n      …not require minimum deposit to unlock trading\n      …not require KYC\n      …not limit withdrawal amounts for non-KYC users\n    \n\n    The ideal platform for this sort of thing (not as if you had much to choose from).\n\n    While most trading exchanges are quick to list random DeFi tokens, Monero’s blockchain is so different and the coin so niche that it is usually not commercially reasonable to support it.\n\n    Hence, FTX doesn’t list Monero and nor do any smaller trading platforms like Phemex and Bitforex. These exchanges focus on speculative trading and in line with that, they only list a XMR perpetual swap, a derivative that pays out in BTC or USDT and does not work with actual Monero at all.\n\n    Binance does have Monero spot (available after KYC), but the community reports serious problems with buying Monero there.\n  \n\n\nFinal words: What to do with your XMR after you buy\n\nPut it into a Monero wallet and look at it! …Not going into any non-PC suggestions here.\n\nIf you want to speculate on Monero’s price fluctuations, you can always use the perp on FTX and get a profit without moving your XMR stash. FTX has the lowest fee out of today’s crypto trading platforms and is pretty reliable.\n",

      title: "Where to buy and trade SHIB (Trust Wallet, DEXes, no-KYC places)",
      content: "Dogecoin’s popularity, based in part on Elon Musk’s public endorsement, is often thought of as the origin of meme coins.\n\nThat’s even though DOGE was one of the first ever alt coins that came to existence years ago. It was created as a joke though, and as all other memecoins it has very little in the way of actual use cases. Their price depends solely on the “hype” factor.\n\nGood news is that Shiba Inu now supports cold staking after the 2022 round of Ethereum network upgrades. More on staking SHIB here but the place to stake Shiba Inu with highest staking rewards is Binance.com.\n\nWhat Is Shiba Inu (SHIB)\n\nShiba Inu is the most popular meme coin after Dogecoin. It was created by an anonymous person known as Ryoshi and launched in August 2020 on Ethereum’s blockchain, but it really only started getting traction in May of 2021. It got so popular, in fact, that by March 2022 it would gain more than x1000 it’s fiat value year-on-year.\n\nThe true identity of the creator(s) is still unknown. Whether it’s a group of people or an individual, the SHIB coin was clearly meant to challenge Dodgecoin’s position.\n\n\n  As of May 5th 2022, SHIB stands at $0.000021, down 75% from its all-time high price of $0.000076 late in 2021.\n  DOGE stands at $0.13 on May 5th 2022, down 60% from it’s all-time high of 0.33 in May 2021.\n\n\nIs Shiba Inu a good altcoin to buy?\n\nIf you are a skilled trader, Shiba Inu may still get you rich, but make no mistake about it - meme coins like SHIB or APE are only good for short term gains.\n\nThe problem with SHIB is that it runs only on hype, but doesn’t seem to be getting endorsed by the big names, save for one speculative covert mention by Musk. But the Shiba Inu coin became a hit regardless. You don’t even have to wonder what wallet holds SHIB. While some SHIB clones like AKITA or BABYDOGE haven’t managed to rise to such levels of popularity, SHIB is now a widely adopted coin and still rising in popularity.\n\nAs a trader, you’d still be missing out if you didn’t consider short-term trading SHIB.\n\nSo if you really want to try your hands at low-cap crypto trading with SHIB, then exit your position as soon as you make meaningful gains - you might want to try one of the manual scalping strategies here.\n\nThe pros of trading SHIB\n\nThere’s no going around it - SHIB is a meme coin. It’s playing off of Dogecoin’s popularity and one Elon Musk’s vague tweet about Shiba Inu referring to the dog breed but to Musk’s followers, suggesting endorsement of the coin.\n\nCan buying Shiba Inu make you rich? Sure, if you sell in time. Meme coins, as a rule, don’t have any meaningful use cases, but their price sometimes explodes.\n\nThat’s why they are sometimes called the “penny stock crypto”. It is a reference to their fiat value, which is typically less than a penny a piece, but at the same time it points to penny stock trading - penny stocks behave the same way in that their value sometimes explodes.\n\nIn the economic environment they occupy more or less the niche of the Tulip mania. A lot of people falling for one unsound investment at the time means some do get filthy rich off of it, but it also means many are left holding the bag.\n\nWhere to Buy Shiba Inu Coin\n\n\n  SHIB is present on most larger cryptocurrency exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase, Bitfinex, FTX, etc.\n  No-KYC custodial exchanges like Bitforex and Phemex also trade SHIB - more than that: Memecoins, penny crypto and trading contests on meme markets are the specialty of those two exchanges.\n  Decentralized exchanges Uniswap and Kine are also good for Shiba Inu coin exchange. Kine has low SHIB fees for a DEX - flat 0.05%. That’s great for trading.\n  We can also buy shiba coin directly from Trust Wallet.\n\n\nBuying on exchanges is easy, so we’ll just list how to buy SHIB through the Binance-owned Trust Wallet here.\n\nWhere to stake Shiba Inu Coin\n\nShiba Inu now supports locked (cold) staking since the latest round of ETH network upgrades. More on staking SHIB here but the place to stake Shiba Inu with highest staking rewards is Binance.com.\n\n\n  To access SHIB staking on Binance, click this link which takes you directly to the list of locked staking coins. Then type SHIB into the search bar on the left.\n\n\nHow to Buy SHIB with Trust Wallet\n\n\n  \n    First off, you need to have Trust Wallet installed and set up.\n\n    If this is your first time buying or depositing SHIB, add SHIB from the available list from the top right corner. Shiba Inu will appear as Shiba Inu ERC20.\n  \n  \n    To buy Shiba Inu coin in an un-hosted wallet will need you to have some Ethereum.\n\n    SHIB is an Ethereum token, so you need ETH even to just receive the SHIB token as well.\n  \n  \n    So, first make sure you have enough ETH.\n\n    You will need it both for buying Shiba Inu crypto and the gas fees. We will be buying SHIB for ETH, so get enough ETH for the SHIB as well as for the gas fees.\n\n    \n      If you have a Binance account, you will probably just get ETH there.\n      If you want to buy ETH with lower trading fees, there’s FTX.\n      If KYC is something you don’t care for, there’s Bitforex for a classic crypto no-KYC exchange or LocalCryptos for a zero-knowledge P2P decentralized app.\n    \n  \n  \n    Once your Trust Wallet has enough ETH to buy SHIB in the amount you desire, navigate to DApps tab in the Trust Wallet and select Uniswap Exchange in the DeFi category.\n  \n  \n    Connect your wallet. You will see the coin swap dashboard right away.\n  \n  \n    In the coin swap dashboard, pick ETH as the coin in the top box.\n  \n  \n    In the box below put the coin we are exchanging ETH for, which is SHIB.\n\n    The easiest way is to search for SHIB and then “import” it. If you are having trouble with that you can also simply paste SHIB’s contract address, which is: 0x95ad61b0a150d79219dcf64e1e6cc01f0b64c4ce\n  \n  \n    Now enter the amount you want to exchange.\n\n    Mind that you will still need a bit of ETH for the exchange fee, so don’t be surprised if you can’t use 100% of ETH you got to buy SHIB.\n  \n  \n    Now you are ready to perform the swap and buy Shiba Inu, so check the details one last time and simply confirm.\n\n    It will take a few minutes to process, but very soon you will see SHIB in your wallet. Good job, you now know how to buy Shiba Inu coin in Trust Wallet.\n  \n\n\nHow to save on gas: One important thing to note that the transaction fee for ETH depends based on traffic. Ethereum’s gas fee varies depending on the number of transactions happening at the same time. Transaction traffic usually slows down between Friday afternoon and Sunday afternoon. If you want to save on fees, plan your transactions for this time of the week.\n\nFinal words: What to do with SHIB after you buy\n\nBe sure to follow all the crypto news closely if you decide to invest in Shiba Inu coin and don’t get too greedy. SHIB is a good short term investment but remember that it is just a memecoin and the social media hype is fickle.\n\nSHIB can now newly be staked. The best staking rewards for locked staking of Shiba Inu are on Binance. Check the rates here: click this link which takes you directly to the list of locked staking coins.\n\nGood luck out there!\n",

      title: "How to Diversify Your Crypto Portfolio (2 No-Nonsense Methods)",
      content: "As cryptocurrencies become more and more popular, many people are starting to invest in them. With the recent Bitcoin boom, cryptocurrency investing has been a hot topic for some time now. But since cryptocurrencies are highly volatile, which means prices fluctuate unexpectedly, investing in them may expose investors to a potential financial risk. This is where crypto portfolio diversification enters the picture.\n\nHowever, the problem (and the opportunity) is that most people don't know how to diversify their crypto portfolios properly.\n\nDiversifying your crypto portfolio can be a challenge.\n\nThere are so many different coins out there, and it's easy to get overwhelmed when trying to decide which ones you should invest in.\n\nSome choose to follow the hype and invest in those cryptos that are trending, like what happens in Dogecoin cryptocurrency, which initially happens to be a meme coin. Dogecoin's price reached its all-time high after Reddit groups and a CEO of an electric car company announced their fondness for dogecoin.\n\nHowever, the coin's price plummeted after a few months. This is another reason why diversifying your crypto portfolio is essential to minimize the risk associated with sudden and unexpected crypto price movements.\n\nTo get an overview of the various ways to diversify your crypto portfolio and which coins or tokens you should invest in, read through this article.\n\nWhat Is Cryptocurrency Portfolio Diversification?\n\nDiversifying your cryptocurrency portfolio means that you invest in different coins and tokens to hedge against their price changes.\n\nThe idea behind diversification goes like this: If Bitcoin's price drops drastically, then some altcoins (alternative coins), like Ethereum, Litecoin, and Tron, might appreciate on the same event, or at least drop much less.\n\nGenerally, diversifying crypto investments comes with some benefits. For instance, diversification gives investors protection against financial risk, as well as an opportunity to explore various types of coins and projects and attain a better profit performance. Remember, having a diversified cryptocurrency portfolio means that you have the flexibility to enter various crypto markets and that you’re less susceptible to incurring significant investment losses.\n\nHence, to effectively diversify your portfolio, you should invest in more than one coin or token. Ideally, you will choose several cryptocurrencies with different fundamental values or with different potential valuations.\n\nLet’s explain that.\n\n1. Diversify by Value: Invest In Coins With Different Use Cases\n\nEach cryptocurrency is created with a purpose.\n\nSome are used as a digital currency for fast and easy transactions worldwide without involving third parties, while others are designed to be used as a digital store of value.\n\nFor example, Bitcoin and Monero were created for use as alternative currencies; Ethereum is built for smart contracts and launching new tokens by projects, which have their own ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings).\n\nSince each cryptocurrency has its specific purpose, or fundamental value, it's more efficient to diversify your portfolio by dividing investment funds between different industries.\n\nThis method does require a lot of research. In the age of DeFi, it also requires understanding of the technology behind each cryptocurrency.\n\nOne thing that’s pretty much set in stone is that in diversification by fundamentals you should definitely avoid pump and dump coins.\n\n2. Diversify by Valuation: Diversify Based On Cryptocurrency's Project Location\n\nA cryptocurrency's project location is also a good indicator of whether or not it's worth investing in.\n\nInvesting in projects located in regions with more leeway in crypto investing may be more convenient and cost-effective than other regions.\n\nKeep in mind that there are countries that either put restrictions or completely banned crypto projects - a prominent example is BlockFi getting cease and desist order in July 2021.\n\n\n\nWith this, always check if the project has necessary licenses and avoid investing in any project from a country that has banned cryptocurrencies, even if the coin itself is legal in other countries. This is to avoid any future legal trouble associated with your cryptocurrency investments based on a certain project location.\n\nAnother aspect that is heavily influenced by the project’s location is its potential valuation. The number of loyal followers of a crypto project might depend on its location and marketing. Remember that a country where crypto is already widely used may succeed faster than in countries with less adoption.\n\nIndeed, there are effective ways to make a diversified crypto portfolio. But aside from the ones mentioned above, you can diversify your investments through a crypto Individual Retirement Account (IRA). When you buy crypto in an IRA, you have the opportunity to protect your financial holdings against economic issues.\n\nIf you’re looking for a financially comfortable life after retirement, making an investment in a crypto IRA will be a wise decision. Even if there’s inflation, you’ll have nothing to worry about because crypto investments in your IRA aren’t affected by the price fluctuations associated with traditional investments. So, if you’re planning to diversify your portfolio with a crypto IRA, check out some reliable resources online to know how and where you can start.\n\nMake A Plan For How Much To Invest And For How Long\n\nBefore you start buying cryptocurrency, make a plan.\n\n\n  How much money can you afford to invest?\n  Under what market conditions are you going to execute your buying positions?\n  Will you buy at once or DCA?\n\n\nTiming the crypto market isn't easy, even for experts. It might be worth waiting for a dip in the market, but the market can always turn the other way while you wait.\n\nWhat you can do is make a list of the cryptocurrencies you want to invest in and set up price alerts. This way, you'll be updated each time the market reaches your target price.\n\nIf that sounds like way too much time and stress, then dollar cost average and leave out the whole issue with market timing.\n\nAssess the risks coin by coin\n\nEfficient capital allocation is a system of determining what investment projects are less or more risky than others.\n\nIf you're just getting started, it might be good to start with a currency that is already established and fluctuates relatively little, like Bitcoin. Or, if you come from legacy investing, you can absolutely buy precious metals as a base.\n\nBy doing so, you'll at least have one pretty stable base. That is always a good idea in any portfolio.\n\nOnce you have that, you can venture into smaller and riskier crypto coins.\n\nUnless you’re going for a very short term speculation, do not put a significant percentage of your overall holdings into coins without much trading volume or history yet.\n\nThis is just a rule of thumb. It's not necessarily going to be perfect for every person or scenario: If you want some wild speculation, go for it (within reason).\n\nBut the goal of diversification is that you invest in a bunch of coins out of which some appreciate, some decline, some shoot up and one or two may fail - which is not going to be the end of your world because you have already made money on the other coins.\n\nFinal Words\n\nCryptocurrency markets are volatile.\n\nIf you don’t want to get hit with massive drops on your portfolio but you’re not into active trading either, diversifying is your best option.\n\nAdequate diversification can be done by investing in more than one cryptocurrency after understanding its fundamentals. If you’re looking at more classical options and deciding between investing in cryptocurrency or precious metals as an alternative, always consider the risk-reward ratio of where you invest your money.\n\nNo matter what you choose to do, make sure that it's a strategy that works for you. Also, don't get too caught up in 'pump-and-dump' schemes.\n",

      title: "All about Dash and where to buy it (KYC or no KYC)",
      content: "Let's take a look at what Dash is all about, why did it gain recognition from thousands of users and where can you buy or trade it.\n\n\n  Jump to the list of platforms to buy or trade Dash (with or without KYC)\n\n\nDash stands for digital cash. This slogan reflects the main idea of Dash - to create a digital payment system available anywhere in the world.\n\nTo implement the idea, Dash uses technologies of instant and anonymous transactions and constantly expands a partner network of businesses accepting Dash coins for payment.\n\nOther than that, Dash is one of the top 3 anonymous cryptocurrencies (along with Zcash and Monero) and it is the highest capitalized cryptocurrency that runs on master nodes.\n\nA bit of history\n\nDash was created by Bitcoin fan and crypto-enthusiast Evan Duffield. He thought it was critical that Bitcoin was lacking a way to incorporate anonymous transaction technology and it prompted him to create a new cryptocurrency.\n\nThe history of what is now known as Dash began on January 18, 2014 with the creation of the first block of the cryptocurrency XCoin. Due to a bug in the XCoin codebase, crypto mining went very fast - 1/10 of all possible coins were mined in 4 days. The developers corrected the error and the crypto community decided to continue the project. At the same time changing the cryptocurrency name to Darkcoin.\n\nDarkcoin seemed to have a reputation problem because of its wide use for transactions in the darknet. And in March 2015, another rebranding took place and the modern name Dash appeared.\n\nThe official Dash website is https://www.dash.org/\n\nDash network architecture\n\nThe architecture of the Dash network is two-tiered. That means that the division of consensus is split into two levels: One level runs on the PoW (Proof-of-Work) algorithm, the other runs on the PoSe (Proof-of-Service) algorithm.\n\nThe PoW level contains miners who create new blocks, the PoSe level contains the master nodes - the full nodes that perform special functions in the Dash network.\n\nDash was the first cryptocurrency that implemented master nodes, by the way. Masternodes have since spread and became popular in other cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe functions of master nodes in Dash:\n\n\n  Store a complete copy of the blockchain and constantly update it;\n  Verify and validate new blocks;\n  Implement the InstantSend function, instantly confirming transactions;\n  Ensure the anonymity of transactions.\n\n\nMiners and master node owners are rewarded by the network for performing their functions. It is paid for each new block created and is divided in the following proportion: 45% for miners, 45% for the owners of the masterboards and 10% for the development of the network.\n\nMining for block creation, master nodes for network services\n\nNew blocks in Dash are created just like in Bitcoin, by mining on the basis of the PoW algorithm - that is by means of complex mathematical calculations of a new block hash number.\n\nInitially, mining was done using central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs). Over time, again just like Bitcoin, the mining difficulty rose and Dash mining moved onto professional ASIC mining equipment.\n\nRunning a masternode on Dash is likewise not available to everyone. To create a Dash master node, you need to install and configure the software for it and deposit 1,000 Dash coins into it.\n\nCoins deposited to the Dash masternode wallet are a deposit and remain \"locked\" for the entire duration of the master node being active. Over time, as your masternode participates in Dash network, it starts collecting rewards for the services performed which brings you revenues on the locked amount of Dash.\n\nAdvantages of Dash\n\nRemember the slogan \"Dash - digital cash\" and the basic idea of this crypto - to become a convenient payment system, available anywhere in the world. What is the convenience of cash? Cash payment is always fast and anonymous - you pay the money, take your hot latte and change, and no one knows who had these bills an hour ago and where they will be soon.\n\nThat's why Dash makes anonymity and high speed of transactions its main priority. These qualities are its main advantages.\n\n\n  \n    Anonymity in Dash\n\n    The anonymity of transactions in Dash is ensured by the PrivateSend function. Master nodes work on the principle of a mixer - within the nodes themselves and between them, user transactions are mixed, thus ensuring their anonymity.\n\n    The principle of mixing - transactions are divided into parts and grouped by the size of the sum - 0.001 Dash, 0.01 Dash, 0.1 Dash, 1 Dash and 10 Dash. The master nodes then shuffle them within and among themselves in multiple rounds.\n\n    A random masternode is used for each new round. Up to 8 rounds of shuffling can be set. In the end, the recipient receives the same amount of money that the sender sent him, but with completely different coins.\n\n    The more rounds, the more probability that no one will be able to identify the sender and the recipient of the transaction.\n  \n  \n    Transaction speed\n\n    A transaction is not considered \"confirmed\" until it is included in a new block. The time to create a new block = 2.5 minutes. Thus, the transaction time in Dash does not exceed 2.5 minutes.\n\n    But Dash officially states that it can finalise a transactions in 1 second using its InstantSend function.\n\n    InstandSend is implemented through transaction verification using a consensus mechanism in the master node network. A quorum of 10 random master nodes checks that the funds used in the transaction have not yet been spent and, within 1 second, fixes and confirms them. These master nodes then send information about the transaction to all other members of the network. Any attempt to resend the same funds (so-called “double spending”) will be rejected by the network.\n  \n  \n    High Liquidity\n\n    Dash coins have high liquidity, which means you will hardly ever run into issues trying to buy or sell them. Dash is traded on all major cryptocurrency exchanges and can be exchanged for other cryptocurrencies or fiat in exchangers.\n\n    Dash also trades on no-KYC p2p marketplaces and some instant swaps.\n\n    Dash is one of the oldest altcoins and yet, unlike most alts, it keeps steadily among the top 100 cryptocurrencies in terms of trading volume.\n\n    In terms of capitalization, Dash is also in the top 100 of all cryptocurrencies. As of May 19, 2022, the market capitalization of Dash is about $0.6 billion (according to https://coinmarketcap.com)\n  \n  \n    Dedicated Software\n\n    Dash has its own official software maintained directly by Dash, not relying on any third party wallets.\n\n    Dash wallets from third-party developers exist too and Dash is also supported by multicoin wallets like Exodus, but it is always good to have a wallet that is maintained directly by the coin’s developers.\n\n    Wallets come for computers, mobile, hardware, paper, web, and even text (sms) wallets for those without a smartphone or internet.\n\n    Speaking about the age of Dash, crypto has been on the market for 8 years. For a cryptocurrency, that's a solid term. And during this time Dash proved to be a stable coin.\n  \n\n\nDrawbacks of Dash\n\n\n  \n    Regulatiory Uncertainty\n\n    Legislation in some countries is putting more and more pressure on cryptocurrencies in general and even more so on cryptocurrencies with privacy features like Monero, ZCash and Dash.\n\n    There is legislation, both active and in the works, that may affect Dash and other anonymous coins.\n\n    For example, in January 2020, the fifth EU (European Union) directive aimed at combating money laundering and terrorist financing came into force. One of its points concerns cryptocurrencies - it forces cryptocurrency companies to identify their users, which cannot be done in privacy coins.\n\n    If the regulatory requirements continue to tighten, they could literally oblige cryptocurrency exchanges to remove anonymous cryptocurrencies from their listings. On the other hand, as of today, there is no unified global legislation. It seems unlikely that there would ever be agreement between all governments in the world, which would be the only way to weed out privacy coins entirely.\n  \n  \n    High Volatility\n\n    Other than the regulatory uncertainty, there’s only the high volatility of the exchange rate that is to add to the disadvantages of Dash. But high volatility is a characteristic feature of the cryptocurrency market in general.\n\n    It is important to understand that all cryptocurrencies are a high-risk investment.\n\n    \n  \n\n\nWhere to buy Dash coin\n\n\n  \n    How to buy Dash without KYC:\n\n    To buy Dash for fiat without KYC, you’ll need to use a P2P market.\n\n    Dash is one of the big cryptocurrencies that is available from the zero-knowledge P2P marketplace LocalCryptos. The platform encrypts all private communication, keeping your fiat-based identity secret even if you sharse your banking connection with your counterparty.\n\n    If you want to buy or sell Dash for a cryptocurrency, you can use any of the no-KYC swap exchanges out there. SimpleSwap supports Dash and doesn’t charge a high margin on trades.\n  \n  \n    Buy or sell Dash on a KYC exchange:\n\n    Dash coin is listed on all the big international crypto exchanges like Coinbase, Kraken and Bitfinex. All these exchanges will let you deposit a fiat currency, buy Dash and withdraw it, once you’ve passed the KYC/AML identification check.\n\n    Out of the three exchanges listed, Kraken has the lowest trading fee.\n  \n  \n    Where to trade Dash with the lowest fees\n\n    The super low-fee trading platform FTX made their classic cost-cutting move and listed the Dash perpetual future contract but not a Dash spot pair.\n\n    This is what makes it possible for FTX to keep their trading fees up to 10x lower than on most crypto exchanges.\n\n    For you as a trader it means that you cannot buy Dash on FTX to hold it and withdraw it into your wallet, but you can speculate on the price of Dash by longing or shorting the Dash perp contract.\n\n    The fees on FTX are low enough to not shy away from a stop loss, so make a use of it. Go see the DASH-PERP on FTX here.\n\n    Additionally, if you want to put money on your opinion about privacy cryptocurrencies in general, FTX has a whole set of trading products for the PRIV basket - a weighted basket index of all the privacy focused cryptocoins out there. Here’s the PRIV-PERP contract if you’re curious.\n  \n\n\nConclusion\n\nGenerally speaking, Dash gives a good impression: The coin has been on the market for a long time, it is traded on most big exchanges and is well maintained by a dedicated team. Dash provides its own software, has a clear idea and is developing.\n\nDash is self-financing the coin’s developments, there are no VC shareholders or governments involved. There is the allocation of 10% of income for the development of Dash to guarantee its independence.\n\nAnd of course anonymity. \"Money love silence\", the authorship of the words is attributed to J. Rockefeller. The world of social media is becoming increasingly public and we fall under total control of the state and financial corporations.\n\nDash and similar cryptocurrencies protect a person's fair desire to preserve privacy of their private life, which in the vision of Dash includes that person’s monetary settlements.\n",

      title: "101: Should I Invest in Bitcoin and Ethereum? What are the differences?",
      content: "The world of cryptocurrency is growing by leaps and bounds. Bitcoin alone made an astronomical return on investment, and that’s not even comparable to some newer altcoins. So, it's no wonder that people are asking themselves whether or not they should invest in Bitcoin. Then there’s Ethereum. Should you invest in that as well?\n\nIn this cryptocurrency overview, we will compare Bitcoin and Ethereum and help you make an informed decision about which one is right for you.\n\n\n  \n    What Is Bitcoin?\n\n    Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency that was created in 2009 as an alternative to the fiat monetary system. It is the first and most well-known cryptocurrency in the USA/EN and many other countries. Bitcoin is decentralized, meaning it is not subject to government control or regulation. Transactions are verified by a network of dedicated devices called miners. Miners are rewarded with bitcoins for verifying transactions.\n  \n  \n    What Is Ethereum?\n\n    Ethereum is also a cryptocurrency, but created with the purpose of creating an application platform, not an alternative money. It is different from Bitcoin in that it can run extremely complex smart contracts. Smart contracts are applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of fraud or third-party interference. For that, Ethereum has its own programming language, which allows developers to build a wide range of decentralized applications.\n\n    A lot of investors liked Ethereum’s value proposition and chose Ethereum even though it is much newer and less time-proven than Bitcoin. You can always purchase it on https://changelly.com/exchange/eth/btc as well as exchange it for other coins.\n  \n  \n    Ethereum 2.0\n\n    Ethereum is currently in the process of upgrading to Ethereum 2.0. This upgrade is much needed, as it will make the Ethereum network more scalable, efficient and cheaper to transact on. It is also intended to make Ethereum more environmentally friendly, as it will move from a proof-of-work consensus algorithm to a proof-of-stake algorithm. The proof-of-stake algorithm requires users to stake their Ether tokens in order to validate transactions. This will likely make this coin more attractive to investors, as it will offer an additional staking yield as part of the return on investment.\n  \n\n\nEthereum vs. Bitcoin\n\nSo, should you invest in Bitcoin or Ethereum? The answer depends on your investment focus.\n\nEthereum may be the better option, because it has the potential to become much more than a currency. In the Web 3.0 vision, it could become a platform that changes the way we interact with the internet.\n\nOn the other hand, there are already newer altcoins that are doing what Ethereum is doing, and already on the proof-of-stake algo: Binance Smart Chain or Polygon are at the moment arguably in a better technical position to be actually used by masses of people without causing a network collapse.\n\nIf you are looking for an easy way to make money over the long term, then trading Bitcoin may be the better option. Bitcoin is well established in its use and is the more conservative investment out of the two coins talked about here.\n\nYou can always buy Bitcoin and put it in an interest-earning account on Binance, Bitforex or Phemex - see the current rates below.\n\nWhichever you choose, always remember to invest responsibly and do your research!\n\n\nInterest rates on crypto earning programs change with time. Rates above retrieved from Phemex on May 24, 2022.\n\nHow to Invest in Both Bitcoin and Ethereum\n\nEven if you buy both Bitcoin and Ethereum, your personal financial objectives and understanding of cryptocurrency may influence how much of your money you invest in each. Subramaniam suggests the classic 60/40 split in your portfolio, while Sterling recommends an equal 50/50 arrangement.\n\nIf you're convinced that you should purchase both Bitcoin and Ethereum, there are a few ways to do so.\n\n\n  The first way is to buy both for fiat on a regulated cryptocurrency exchange like Binance or Coinbase or FTX.\n  Another way is to buy both of them on a no-KYC p2p exchange. LocalCryptos have both BTC and ETH marketplaces.\n\n\nOnce you have purchased your coins, you will need to store them in a cryptocurrency wallet. You can use a software wallet like Exodus or a hardware wallet like the new Ledger Nano S Plus.\n\nWhatever the method, experts advise against putting too much of your portfolio into cryptocurrency. However, all decisions are up to you.\n\nShould I Be Considering Any Other Cryptos?\n\nAt the moment, Bitcoin and Ethereum are still the two largest and most popular cryptocurrencies. However, there are many other altcoins that you may also want to consider investing in.\n\nRemember that all the options listed below are significantly more risky than BTC and ETH.\n\n\n  Privacy coins: Monero (XMR), Dash (DASH)\n  NFT and Web3 coins: Binance Coin (BNB), Solana (SOL)\n  Memecoins: Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB)\n\n\nInvesting in cryptocurrency is a risky endeavor. However, if you do your research and invest responsibly, it can be a great way to make money. Just remember to do your own research and never invest more than you are willing to lose.\n",

We have a list of places where you can buy ORBS coin for fiat, for stablecoin or other crypto and where you can trade ORBS coin with the lowest fees. Buying ORBS coin without KYC is also possible.\n\nORBS coin was created as yet another way to resolve the problem where business people are tired of the limitations of public blockchains.\n\nOrbs is creating a platform that allows businesses to choose the blockchain they need. Whether it’s speed, privacy, or extra security, Orbs promises it all.\n\nThe Orbs platform supports amazing applications that were once impossible on public blockchains. Plus, Orbs platform is interoperable with Ethereum. That means that developers can still use all the tools and libraries they’re already familiar with and the barrier to entry is much lower.\n\nYou could argue that Orbs platform could be the business blockchain for Web3, but as the coin was only launched in 2019, it’s still mostly just hypothesis.\n\nWhere to buy ORBS coin for fiat\n\nBuying ORBS coin directly for fiat will need you to get KYC verified. There’s a couple of exchanges that list ORBS and let you buy it for fiat, the largest one is FTX.\n\nFTX.com has two ORBS coin markets - one denominated in USD and one ORBS perpetual swap market.\n\nBinance and Bitfinex don’t list ORBS.\n\nORBS coin is a staking coin.

Anyone opening a new FTX account pays just 0.02% for limit orders and 0.07% for market orders on spot or derivative markets. You may also add 5% referral code savings, as well as exchange token savings if you decide to hold FTT. Use FTX referral code altcointrading.\n\nIn case you are in the USA, you can always trade ORBS on Phemex spot market. Phemex gives fee discounts as a reward for traded volumes but the volume requirements are lower than usual.\n\nCrypto wallets that support ORBS coin\n\nORBS coin can be stored in Metamask.\n\nTo stake ORBS coin, go to the TETRA ORBS staking app at https://staking.orbs.network/.

      title: "SafeMoon: Where to buy and sell, plus everything you need to know",
      content: "Penny cryptocurrencies have gained popularity in recent years, with more and more people trading them. Some of the most popular penny cryptocurrencies are Doge clones, like Shiba Inu or Akita.\n\nBut in March 2021, a new alt coin made waves in the altcoin trading community, which investors call the SafeMoon.\n\nIt is a decentralized cryptocurrency that joined the volatile market of the crypto industry, giving traders more options to diversify their investment portfolios.\n\nSafemoon is built on the Binance Smart Chain and uses the BEP-20 token standard. The cryptocurrency gets its name from the common crypto saying 'To The Moon,' which often indicates that the price of crypto will rise to the moon.\n\nBut what is SafeMoon, how does it work, and who can use it? Answering these questions will help you understand the purpose of SafeMoon and everything else that you need to know. This article will answer these questions and discusses crypto in detail below.\n\nWhat Is SafeMoon?\n\nSafeMoon is a decentralized finance (Defi) token and ecosystem that incentivizes both holding and trading. This token is known for its volatility and the price pumps that come with it.\n\nSafeMoon reached an all-time high of USD$0.000014 in April 2021, a mere month after its launch. It was about a 20,000% increase before a drop of about 80%. However, SafeMoon price prediction indicates that it may realize a steady rise between 2022 to 2030, which would be in line with the popularity of penny cryptos.\n\nThe tech behind SafeMoon\n\nSafeMoon seeks to promote peer-to-peer (P2P) trading and reduce transaction costs through its platform. It eliminates the need for a third party, such as a central bank or financial institution.\n\nSafeMoon is redistributing a percentage of every transaction on the network back to holders. For example, when someone buys SafeMoon, they are charged a small percentage of the total transaction. That percentage is redistributed to all other SafeMoon holders. This system aims to incentivize holding rather than day trading, which can stabilize prices and reduce volatility.\n\nSafeMoon’s blockchain has three functions: reflection, liquidity pool acquisition, and burn. Let's get to know them below:\n\n\n  Reflection is a function that addresses mining outputs. It encourages holders to earn more rewards based on their tokens. It also discourages selling pressure caused by the early adopters selling the coins.\n  Liquidity pool acquisition is a function that establishes a consistent price floor. It aims to avoid great dips in the market caused by whales selling their tokens by imposing a 10% fee for each transaction and giving existing holders 5% of it.\n  Burn is when a small percentage of every transaction is taken out of circulation and sent to an address out of which it cannot be retrieved. Burning reduces the total supply, which in the right conditions can increase prices. SafeMoon uses manual burning to help increase openness.\n\n\nSafeMoon Use Cases\n\nSafeMoon has a variety of use cases, just like any other cryptocurrency. The uses include the following:\n\n\n  Buying And Selling : You can buy and sell SafeMoon like any other cryptocurrency. However, users are discouraged against this to help curb the extreme volatility.\n  Holding Crypto : SafeMoon can be held like any other cryptocurrency. Additionally, it has a staking system that allows users to earn extra income for holding. This makes SafeMoon a Web3 cryptocurrency.\n  Payments : SafeMoon can be used to make and receive payments, at least in theory - it has low liquidity and it is not a preferred transactional cryptocurrency.\n\n\nWhere To Buy SafeMoon\n\nUnlike some other cryptocurrencies, you can't buy SafeMoon through major crypto exchanges.\n\n\n  One way is to buy SafeMoon for Tether on the non-KYC exchange Bitforex.\n\n\nTo buy on Bitforex, you first need to purchase USDT Tether on any exchange that lets you. Then take your Tether to Bitforex and buy SafeMoon.\n\nA similar way is to first buy USDT Tether for your fiat money, but then buy Safemoon on BitMart.\n\n\n  The DEX way to purchase it is for other crypto through pancakeswap.finance, a decentralized exchange built on Binance Smart Chain.\n\n\nTo buy SafeMoon on PancakeSwap, you first need to purchase Binance Coin (BNB) or another cryptocurrency that can be swapped for BNB on an exchange. Once you have BNB, you can then use it to purchase SafeMoon on PancakeSwap.\n\nHow to cash out SafeMoon\n\nIf you want to take profits on your SafeMoon holdings, the best way to do that is to sell SafeMoon for the Tether stablecoin.\n\nThe easiest way is to sell SafeMoon for USDT on Bitforex. Bitforex is a Hong Kong based exchange that doesn’t require KYC - not even to withdraw Tether.\n\nPros and Cons of SaFEMOON\n\nAdvantages Of SafeMoon\n\nThere are numerous advantages of SafeMoon that make it an attractive investment. Some of these advantages include:\n\n\n  It has a low total supply, leading to price increases as demand increases.\n  It has a reflection function that encourages holders to earn more rewards based on their tokens.\n  The latest version SafeMoon 2.0, has low transaction fees, making it more attractive for investors and other future use cases.\n  It has a consistent price floor that helps avoid great dips in the market.\n  It also aims to reduce volatility by redistributing a percentage of every transaction made back to holders.\n\n\nDisadvantages Of SafeMoon\n\nSafeMoon also has some disadvantages that potential investors should be aware of. Some of these disadvantages include:\n\n\n  It is known for extreme volatility, such as the high price rise one month after its launch and the massive drop.\n  It's not as liquid as other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, making it less desirable among vendors who want to accept crypto payments.\n  If the prices drop and investors decide to sell, they'll incur capital losses and the 10% penalty charged for selling SafeMoon.\n\n\nFinal words\n\nSafeMoon is a unique cryptocurrency that has the potential to become a major player in the industry. However, it's still relatively new and volatile, making it a risky investment. Therefore, research well and read resources such as this article to understand it better. Doing so will help you make informed decisions and avoid financial losses.\n",

      title: "Where to buy Chia coin XCH, where to sell and trade (KYC or low KYC)",
      content: "DeFi cryptocurrencies are all the rage right now not only among traders but also among regulators. You know that it is important to have DeFi that is truly decentralized and really secure against attacks. At the same time, this type of DeFi coins can be hard to use and even harder to keep track of.\n\nChia is a DeFi cryptocurrency that was designed from the ground up to make it easier to use than any other currency out there. It is the token of the Chia blockchain, which launched its own mainnet in 2021. Chia’s blockchain maintains the same level of security as Bitcoin’s, but since it’s not PoW, it’s using a fraction of the energy that Bitcoin does.\n\nSome of the special capabilities of Chia blockchain are a native P2P market implementation, where a function of “offers” is embedded into the blockchain.\n\nChia coin (XCH) does not support staking, but it does support mining. Chia has advanced smart contract capabilities and it does support NFTs.\n\nWhat is Chia’s PoST algo\n\nChia uses two consensus algos called Proof of Space and Time. In the codebase, each is it’s own method but they work together in Chia and the duo is shortened as a single algorithm - PoST.  Chia’s Proof of Space and Time consensus uses hardware storage as the scarce resource and then adds a method to verify that time has passed. In Chia’s vision, this is bringing back the meme of Satoshi’s original vision - “one CPU, one vote.”\n\nWith PoST, Chia is proposing one of the innovations of blockchain technology to solve Bitcoin’s energy consumption.\n\nChia claims that PoST makes it much more difficult for actors to game the system or even just gain edge as there’s no specific hardware needed - just a hard drive and an internet connection.\n\nIn reality, people do lease or purchase hardware rigs to mine Chia, it’s just that the miners are not ASIC-type of single use devices.\n\n\n\nHere’s the Chia Network community with some recent high-level tips on using the Chia blockchain:\n\n\n\nWhere to buy Chia coin (XCH) for fiat\n\nBuying (XCH) Chia coin directly for fiat is not possible in 2022, and now that Chia coin has launched the mainnet on its own blockchain, it is not to be expected that Chia will get listed on mainstream exchanges any time soon. Not until there is a ton of interest, for sure.\n\nTo buy XCH coin for fiat, Chia recommends to first buy a stablecoin they partnered with. That is the Stably USD (ticker USDS) and you will need to pass KYC for that. USDS is a self-directed custodial account offered by Prime Trust through Stably, a fintech company focused on digitization of assets. When you’ve acquired USDS through Stably, you can redeem them for Chia coins in Chia’s own crypto wallet.\n\nIn reality, you are much better off doing it the Tether way, because Tether markets for XCH coin are listed on all the OG Asian exchanges: Huobi, OKX (former OKEX), KuCoin, Gate.io, and also on Pionex. You will need to pass some KYC on all of these, Pionex is the most lenient: You get 2000 USD daily withdrawal limit for just a text message and for stating your country without proof.\n\nSo, the easiest way to buy Chia coin is to first buy USDT Tether on any exchange that will let you (could be FTX) - you will need to get KYC verified for this step. Then take your USDT to Pionex and trade it for Chia coin there.\n\nWhere to sell Chia coin\n\nIf you want to cash out your Chia profits or mining revenue, the easiest way is again via USDT Tether. Tether is so far the most reliable stablecoin, so if you are OK with holding it, you can just take your Chia coin to Pionex and sell it there.\n\nThey do require some KYC to withdraw your profits from selling Chia coin, but you will get a withdrawal limit of 2000 USD daily for as little as a text message verification and for stating your country of residence.\n\nPionex only has stablecoin markets (USDC, BUSD, USDT). If you want to cash out into real fiat, you will need another exchange that has the USDT/USD market - that would be FTX for the lowest fees.\n\nWhere to trade CHIA coin\n\nOut of the trading exchanges, Binance, Bitfinex and FTX don’t list CHIA. Out of the non-KYC exchanges, Phemex and LATOKEN likewise don’t list Chia.\n\nIf all you want to do is speculate on the price of CHIA coin, then you will probably want to make an account at Pionex. Pionex is a new Asian trading platform that offers 16 build in trading bots for arbitrage, DCA and more popular trading methods.\n\nCrypto wallets that support CHIA coin\n\nChia coin has its own blockchain and so it needs its own wallet. You can download a Chia light wallet at chia.net.\n",

      title: "How to buy BNB with no KYC",
      content: "If you clicked through to this page because you were asking “why can’t I buy BNB in Trustwallet??” then you are in the right place. BNB is not available for some of you in Trust wallet and other apps that are owned by Binance due to geopolitical reasons.\n\nThis is crypto, which means the global community provided a workaround - as always.\n\nIn this guide:\n\n\n  How to buy BNB in the US\n  How to buy BNB without KYC - The two-step process\n  List of platforms that let you buy to buy BNB without KYC\n  List of platforms that let you stake BNB without Binance\n\n\nAs you probably know, the Binance coin, or BNB, is the cryptocurrency token of the Binance exchange.\n\nTraders treat BNB as a security-type of asset: The price action of BNB represents to some degree how well the Binance behemoth is doing. Binance is by far not just an exchange - they run the staking wallet Trustwallet and run the Innovation Zone platform.\n\nThat is why some crypto investors are considering buying BNB to hold, as opposed to buying it as a utility token to be used while trading on Binance.\n\nCommon reasons that people name for investing in BNB:\n\n\n  Buy and Hold strategy, betting on the bright future of Binance\n  As a hedge against BTC price swings\n  To use the fee benefits, which further strengthens Binance. (Traders can use 50% of their trading fees for buying back some of the BNB they sell, which also creates demand for it.)\n\n\nWhile in the case of big cryptocurrencies (think BTC, ETH) it is easy to buy without KYC, BNB is still a relatively niche coin. You won’t see it listed on p2p markets like LocalCryptos.\n\nYou could possibly make a private deal with a trusted vendor there, but that’s not something you can do with a vendor you’ve just traded with once.\n\n\n\nHow to buy BNB in the US\n\nBuying the Binance coin in the US is complicated for geopolitical and regulatory reasons.\n\nAs of May 2022, BNB coin is not outlawed or prohibited in the USA. The platform however - Binance.com - is banned from the US for lack of compliance, but its more compliant sister Binance.us is allowed in most US states.\n\nRestricted states at Binance.us are means Hawaii (HI), Idaho (ID), Louisiana (LA), New York (NY), Texas (TX), and Vermont (VT) in June 2022 and please verify the current list at Binance.us ToS.\n\n\n  If your state allows Binance.us, then you can pass your KYC and buy BNB coin from the US directly for USD at binance.us/en/buy-sell-crypto/BNB.\n\n\nSo, the problem with trading BNB in the US is just that the big US-based crypto platforms do not usually list the exchange token of their biggest competitor, not that buying BNB is not allowed.\n\nBut most US traders can buy BNB on Binance.us, and those of you who cannot buy BNB on Binance.us can always use the two-step buying process.\n\nNo need to go all-in P2P the way it’s described in the no-KYC section below. If your only crime is that you are a resident of a US state that does not allow Binance.us, the you can always buy BTC or USDT for your first step on any exchange where you are already KYC-verified.\n\n\n  Step 1 - Buy USDT Tether on any big regulated exchange that lets you: FTX.us or Coinbase will do\n  Step 2 - Take your Tether to Phemex and buy BNB on their BNB/USDT market. Phemex does not require KYC to withdraw.\n\n\nIf you prefer not trading in Tether, then buy BTC in your first step instead. Then take it to the no-KYC platform Bitforex which has a BNB/BTC market.\n\nOf course, you can also buy BNB fully without KYC. More on that below.\n\n\n\nHow to buy BNB without KYC: The two-step buying process\n\nBinance made AML/KYC mandatory for all users in 2021, in addition to sidelining US traders to the Binance.us platform and banning traders from several other countries just flat out completely even from their own software wallet (the TrustWallet).\n\nIt is not possible at the moment to buy BNB directly from fiat without doing KYC. What is possible, however, is to buy BTC or ETH without KYC.\n\nSo, if one wants to buy some BNB without going through the KYC process, one must consider the two step process to buying alt coins - just like the old times.\n\n\n  Step 1 - Buy BTC on a non-KYC platform such as LocalCryptos\n  Step 2 - Trade BTC for BNB on a non-KYC platform that trades smaller alts. Bitforex has a BNB/BTC market (see more options below)\n\n\nThe exchanges that allow traders to buy BNB without having to send their IDs are much less compliant with the anti-money laundering (AML) and counter terrorist financing (CTF) regulations. These days, that’s sometimes that makes the exchange look sketchy, and often that suspicion ends up being justified. So, as a note, if you really want to buy BNB with no KYC, do not leave your BNB on the exchange but withdraw it into Exodus or Ledger.\n\nStep 1 - Buy BTC or ETH\n\nOne of the safest no-KYC alternatives to onramp to crypto are p2p markets like LocalCryptos. They allow exchange between fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies, but have zero knowledge of its details, which under the current laws (February 2022) exempts them from doing KYC/AML.\n\nThere is a law-enforcement push to change that from the SEC. The SEC here claims that it wants to start overseeing even platforms outside of its jurisdiction, and at that any kind of platform that could possibly facilitate a transaction. Zero-knowledge platforms would probably be outlawed, but the exact implications are not clear yet. (Financial Times, 7 Feb 2022 https://archive.is/zWnwA)\n\nSo, if you’re considering onramping to crypto this way, maybe it would be a good idea to make up your mind soon. Just saying.\n\nStep 2 - Buying BNB on a non-KYC exchange\n\nSo if you want to buy some BNB without filling up a lot of forms, you can simply select a platform here below.\n\n\n  Generate an account\n  Deposit BTC\n  Open a trade to buy BNB for your BTC\n\n\nOnce you have your BNB, withdraw it to a wallet like Metamask or, if it’s a larger amount, Ledger.\n\nFor added privacy you could be using another pseudonymous factor such as TOR browser or a prepaid SIM card.\n\n\n\nList of no-KYC exchanges where you can buy BNB for other crypto\n\n\n  \n    Bitforex (has no-KYC BNB/BTC market)\n\n    Bitforex is one of the go-to trading platform for non-KYC perps, meme coins and low-profile NFT coins like OMI. They are quite a small exchange still, and at the moment do not require KYC.\n\n    BNB/BTC market on Bitforex\n  \n  \n    Phemex (has no-KYC BNB/USDT market)\n\n    Phemex exchange uses the limit model, where if you don’t verify your identity, you can still trade but your withdrawal amounts will be limited to max 2 BTC worth a day. KYC’d users get lower fees, can participate in all of the airdrops and contests and their limits are lifted.\n\n    Either way, there is a BNB/USDT market that you can access without KYC and withdrawals of BNB are available on the same conditions as with other markets.\n\n    BNB/USDT market on Phemex\n  \n  \n    SimpleSwap (has no-KYC BNB/BTC and other BNB markets)\n\n    SimpleSwap is a no-KYC swap and exchange where you can insta-buy BNB for BTC or other crypto without having to do any KYC.  You can trade any amount from roughly 35 USD to about 35,000 USD in a single transaction.\n\n    The exchange rates at SimpleSwap are only 1% over the market prices at FTX, which is not a bad margin at all. For smaller traded amounts it’s a really good choice, you won’t overpay that much for the convenience.\n\n    BNB/BTC on SimpleSwap\n\n    Use the following coupon for a bonus of 300 units of their fee token: SsITvSMQ0Cru0ERU\n  \n  \n    FTX.com (has BNB/BTC market)\n\n    The duo of FTX platforms requires KYC, but not until your account is about to hit a withdrawal value threshold. The threshold accumulates over time.\n\n    For international traders the threshold used to be 1k USD, not sure if that still applies in 2022.\n\n    BNB/BTC on FTX.com (Intl)\n\n    US traders are meant to use the FTX.us platform but the US platform does not trade BNB.\n  \n  \n    OKX (formerly OKEx or OKCoin)\n\n    BNB does not trade on OKX anymore.\n  \n  \n    Gate.io\n\n    Gate.io requires KYC for all customers.\n  \n\n\n\n\nFinal words: What to do with your BNB after you buy (Stake BNB without Binance!)\n\nYou can invest in BNB coin and then earn extra income from staking BNB.\n\nThe best passive income from BNB comes from staking BNB on your own. You can stake BNB from Trustwallet, which is a software wallet owned by Binance itself. You can also use BNB for soft staking and yield generation on the Binance exchange - but all that requires KYC.\n\nThe details vary based on your geolocation, but generally speaking, the days of no-KYC anything on Binance are gone.\n\nIf you’re one of those who got “BNB not available” in Trust Wallet, use Exodus wallet or Metamask to hold it, and Kine DEX to stake it.\n\n\n  Kine DEX is a new DEX that is run by ex-Huobi people. Kine made it to this post because it lets you stake BNB from anywhere and without KYC.\n\n\nStaking is the ultimate passive income for all those who want to make money without working hard or investing a lot of time and energy: it’s like owning a piece (a share) in Facebook but better - plus it has an actual product everyone wants.\n\nThere is a lot of demand for easy BNB staking, but the big staking pools and node providers like AllNodes are staying away from it. You may be lucky with smaller pools, but beware of scams - there are many.\n",

What is certain is that Samoyedcoin is a tribute to the FTX founder and crypto mogul Sam Bankman-Fried and Solana’s Co-Founder Anatoly Yakovenko.\n\nSamoyedcoin is just a meme token, but it aims at using the power of the meme to advance the development of the Solana ecosystem.\n\nSamoyed coin is a unique digital asset that backs a community focused on onboarding Solana users into dog money. With the rise of both memecoins and Solana, now is the perfect time for a project like SAMO.\n\nBy investing in SAMO, you’re supporting an emerging digital asset and community around Solana that is poised for success. With your help, we can continue to grow and build a better future for everyone involved.\n\nWhere to buy SAMO coin for fiat\n\nBuying SAMO coin directly for fiat will need you to get KYC verified. There are not many exchanges that list SAMO and let you buy it for fiat, but a good one is Kraken.\n\nKraken lists a USD market for Samoyedcoin that is accessible from anywhere in the world. That means you can buy Samoyed coin on Kraken from the USA as well.\n\nBinance and Bitfinex don’t list SAMO.\n\nOKX lists a Tether market for Samoyedcoin.

You will need to be KYC-verified to buy Tether for fiat. Some of the best exchanges to do that on are FTX or Coinbase.\n  In the second step, deposit USDT into LATOKEN and buy Samoyedcoin on their Tether market.\n\n\nSamoyedcoin is not listed on the rest of the classic non-KYC destinations such as Phemex, Bitforex and Bitfinex.\n\nIf you want to buy Samoyedcoin without KYC in a decentralized way, you can do so at one of the following DEX platforms: Orca, Raydium, Jupiter.\n\nAs a first step to buy SAMO on a DEX swap, you will need to first buy Solana (SOL). You can buy SOL on any KYC’d exchange that is available in your region, such as FTX or Coinbase.\n\nWhere to trade SAMO coin\n\nIf all you want to do is speculate on the price of SAMO coin, then you will probably want to make an account at OKX.\n\nThe Chinese platform OKX is a past behemoth of the likes of today’s Binance. The former glories of OKX are now gone, but OKX remains a solid platform for trading: The app is always available, the exchange is not run by amateurs and the UI is well designed for active traders. You will need to pass some KYC.\n\nAlternatively, if you’d prefer a non-KYC exchange for your trading, you can trade your Samoyedcoin on LATOKEN.\n\nCrypto wallets that support SAMO coin\n\nSAMO coin can be stored in any wallet that stores Solana tokens. The best software wallet to store SOL ecosystem tokens is Phantom wallet.\n\nTo DeFi-stake SAMO coin, you can go to Orca, Raydium or Jupiter DEXes and become a liquidity provider in their SAMO pools.\n",

One of its issues is front-running, where transactions are all publicly visible on blockchain before they are confirmed, which means they can be arbitrarily reordered.\n\nEden is a protocol that solves this problem by guaranteeing transaction placement and protection from arbitrary reordering by repackaging the transactions in an opaque way. This makes the network more secure and DEX trading less risky.\n\nTo access this Eden Relay feature, the Eden network recommends in their documentation to add the Eden Network RPC into MetaMask and connect to that network. If you then submit your ETH transactions through that, they will not be visible on the ETH blockchain, but it will be confirmed via the Eden blockchain.\n\nEDEN coin staking\n\nEDEN coin is a staking coin. You can stake EDEN via MetaMask or another web3 wallet connected to https://app.edennetwork.io.\n\nDeFi users can stake EDEN to gain access to the Eden Relay as the staking rewards are paid out in EDEN token.

RUNE is a DeFi token with max supply of 22,530 tokens.\n\nTHORChain is designed to restore the ethos of decentralization to the crypto and blockchain space, and of course you cannot really do that if your project has a CEO.\n\nThe THORChain liquidity platform is a classic DEX liquidity pool in that users can deposit native assets and farm yields. This liquidity then makes it possible for other users to exchange crypto assets from different networks without losing custody of their cryptocurrencies.\n\nAnother point that adds value to THORChain is that it’s a blockchain that enables users to send tokens between different blockchains. The nodes on the network have an additional responsibility to agree whether transactions coming from different blockchains are valid.\n\nWhere to buy RUNE token for fiat\n\nBuying RUNE directly for fiat will need you to get KYC verified. There’s a couple of exchanges that list RUNE and let you buy it for fiat, most notable Binance International.\n\nFTX International has much lower fees, but the exchange delisted RUNE spot market from Jun 13, 2022 until the integration of its native blockchain.\n\nThis is very important to mention: There is a native, THORChain version of the RUNE token and then a Binance chain version of RUNE. On custodial exchanges, KYC or non-KYC, you’ll usually get the Binance RUNE.\n\nTheir pricing should be in sync (save a catastrophic event) but some of RUNE’s technical capabilities are not available in the Binance version.\n\nHere’s THORChain community on how to switch Binance RUNE to native, THOR RUNE:\n\n\n\nStaking the RUNE coin\n\nRUNE is not a maintream coin, which means you will have to use a staking wallet to yield from holding it - you can’t stake RUNE on any exchange yet.\n\nEither way, RUNE in its original version of THORChain is a staking coin.\n\nTo stake native RUNE, download the dedicated THORwallet: https://www.thorwallet.org/.\n\nAnother option to yield income on RUNE token is by Liquidity Provision. THORChain runs a swap for their assets and Liquidity providers are compensated with swap fees and system rewards.\n\nCompensation is affected by a number of factors related to the pool and the state of the network but THORChain provides a community for LPs and a lot of videos to understand the liquidity pooling on THORChain. More here.\n\n\n\nWhere to buy RUNE without KYC\n\nYou guessed it, the RUNE crypto is not available in the USA sister platforms of neither Binance nor FTX.\n\nIf you are in the United States and want to buy RUNE before it’s listed on mainstream crypto platforms, you will need to do the two-step process.\n\n\n  First buy BTC on any exchange available for you. That could be any exchange like Coinbase or much better, Kraken.\n  Then swap BTC for BNB RUNE via SimpleSwap. - SimpleSwap is a no-KYC exchange that has rates only 1% over FTX.\n\n\nWhere to trade RUNE\n\nIf all you want to do is speculate on the price of RUNE, then you will probably want to make an account at FTX to trade the RUNE perpetual swap\n\nSo, FTX has a perp market for RUNE crypto even after the USD and Tether markets got off from Jun 13, 2022 until the integration of RUNA’s native blockchain. FTX has the industry’s lowest trading fees - only 0.02% for limit orders and 0.07% for market orders. Use FTX referral code altcointrading for even more discount.\n\nIn case you can’t trade on FTX, such as because you are in the USA, you can always trade RUNE perps on Phemex. Unfortunately there is no spot RUNE market on Phemex.\n\nEither way, Phemex gives fee discounts as a reward for traded volumes and the volume requirements are lower than usual - worth checking out if you trade perps.\n\nCrypto wallets that support RUNE\n\nSince 2022, Exodus wallet supports the Binance version of RUNE. That means you can also hold RUNE on Ledger and Trezor wallets, using Exodus as your wallet app. It’s the Binance version of RUNE, though.\n\nTo store native RUNE and to stake RUNE, you’ll need the dedicated THORwallet: https://www.thorwallet.org/\n\nNeither Binance nor FTX support hosted staking of RUNE. To stake RUNE, get THORwallet.\n\nOriginally published in May 2022, reworked in June 2022.\n",

They created the coin on the basis of Ethereal Blockchain with a total supply of 750 billion tokens, some of which have been burned.\n\nOMI used crypto algorithm Ethash, which is the most efficient algos at this time.

GoChain is backwards-compatible with an older version of Ethereum. OMI holders could still store the token in ETH wallets, although the VeVe wallet was most recommended.\n\nIn January 2022, Ecomi migrated from GoChain to Ethereum to get compatibility with the new and soon-to-be-deployed features of Ethereum.

The year was tumultuous for almost all alt coins, and so considering the overall conditions as well as the fact how new OMI is, the coin kept relatively stable.\n\nThe OMI coin certainly did not run on hype like the dog tokens, neither crash into goblin town never to recover, as seen with the likes of EOS.\n\nOn the other hand, in the 2022 macro conditions and looming crypto winter, there is not much reason to buy any cryptocurrency.\n\nOMI coin staking\n\nThe custodial exchange AscendEX runs an OMI staking pool.\n\nFYI, AscendEX was hacked in the past which might put you off. It’s still worth to at least subscribe to their newsletter if you are interested in the OMI coin because AscendEX runs regular offers of established altcoin sales at below-the-market prices for their subscribers.\n\nWhere to buy OMI coin\n\n\n  Bitforex Ecomi/Tether market\n  TradingView chart\n\n\nAt the moment it’s only the smaller Asian exchanges where you can buy and trade OMI coins.\n\nBitforex exchange\n\n\n\nThe biggest market is the Asian no-KYC outfit Bitforex, for obvious reasons. Bitforex also runs and NFT marketplace and all the new and small DeFi and NFT projects tend to concentrate there.\n\nOMI charting: OKX &amp; Co, and TradingView\n\nBut OMI also traders on OKEx and AscendEX. Thanks to these two markets you can get the full-featured OMI/USDT price chart on TradingView.\n\nIf you are trying to find out where to stake OMI, AscendEX runs an OMI staking pool.\n\n\n\nWhat makes OMI interesting?\n\n\n  Binance listing would shake things up\n\n\nOMI is not yet listed on Binance, although various outlets have been shouting that listing is “virtually certain” since mid 2021.\n\n\n  Full ecosystem\n\n\nThis is a project going beyond the usual buy OMI cryptocurrency. The team has developed a whole ecosystem buy Ecomi for investors and people who want to earn on mining or stocks of metal resources.\n\nIn addition to its own token, OMI can mint NFTs and runs its own marketplace for digital collectibles.\n\n\n  Industry trends suit OMI\n\n\nNot to mention that NFT gaming is quite a trendy niche to be in, not to mention it’s more predictable in terms of making profits trading game assets rather than NFT art.\n\nThe NFT gaming space is very much what the company, based in Singapore, focuses on:\n\n  https://medium.com/ecomi/tagged/updates\n  https://www.ecomi.com/\n\n\nNFT games are  currently enjoying a lot of interest in the community. NFT games are dApp games that feature NFT collectibles that are game characters.\n\nThe owner can develop them which makes them more valuable as an in-game asset for other players. That’s where marketplaces for collectibles come in, they connect NFT traders with gamers who are looking for strong characters to get ahead in their game. This is the 101 of how traders earn good money developing valuable NFT characters.\n\nBottom line\n\nOMI is not a super high-profile NFT currency like Solana, but for a crypto that does not even trade on Binance the price action showed remarkable stability during a pretty bad season. Possibly worth looking into.\n\n\n  Buy OMI on Bitforex Ecomi/Tether market\n  Trade OMI with a TradingView chart\n  Stake OMI on AscendEX (more about AscendEX here)\n\n\nOriginally published in February 2022, reworked in June 2022.\n",

      title: "Beginner&#39;s Guide to Trading: 5 Ways to Get Started Trading Forex",
      content: "Trading can be a great way to make money and control your own financial future. It's also a very complex activity that will burn you out quickly if you are not trading in a style that fits your psychology.\n\nIf you're new to trading and are considering forex vs crypto, know that it is important that you start learning with the right knowledge.\n\nThis guide aims to walk you through the basic steps if you want to test your skill in forex; you might also wish to use tools such as the TradingView app to help you out.\n\n\n  \n    Open a Practice Account\n\n    A practice account, also known as paper trading account, is where you can start trading with simulated money before committing to real funds. Practice accounts are completely free and will give you a chance to learn the basics of forex trading with no risk. So if you want to get started fast, this is the way to go.\n\n    There are thousands of brokers out there that offer these kinds of accounts, but it's important that the broker you choose has an established reputation because that means they're trustworthy and their software is safe.\n\n    Practice accounts can be used for getting used to watching live market movements on charts, learning how orders work in real-time conditions, practicing how to place strategies like buy stops and sell stops, or even just getting comfortable with placing trades.\n\n    Paper trading will not teach you how to handle emotions in trading as you don’t work with real money, but it is still a valuable tool. So, make sure that whatever software your chosen broker has for its accounts is easy to use so nothing holds you back from getting started quickly.\n  \n  \n    Find your Trading Style and Strategy\n\n    The next step to becoming a successful trader is developing your own trading strategy or at least knowing what trading style you are comfortable with.\n\n    While in cryptocurrencies you have the freedom to choose long-term strategies or even DCA and buy&amp;hold, forex will only be a good fit if you are comfortable with short-term trading. This is something you need to find out for yourself.\n\n    Either way, you will be able to make better decisions and stay on track if you have a plan in place.\n  \n  \n    Master Your Emotions\n\n    Mastering your emotions is arguably as important as knowing the fundamentals of your financial instrument - be it national currencies or cryptocurrencies.\n\n    Every single person has a different emotional makeup, which makes it challenging to generalise how you should manage your own emotions in relation to trading.\n\n    However, we can all agree on some basic principles: Emotions can cause us to make bad trading decisions because they tend to cloud our judgment. This applies to making decisions related to money matters and elsewhere.\n\n    Generally speaking it makes sense to take a break from trading if you are feeling emotional, stressed, angry, or are otherwise not in a fit state to think clearly.\n  \n  \n    Have a Trading Plan\n\n    A trading plan is a written document that describes your expectations for the future. It's a road map for your trading and should include your goals, strategy, and risk management plan.\n\n    A good trading plan should include:\n\n    \n      The type of market (i.e., forex, stocks, futures) that you will trade in and why it's appropriate for your goals;\n      An idea about how many positions or contracts you'll open at one time;\n      How much leverage (margin) to use;\n      How long each position should last before being closed out in order not to lose more than what's lost in any single trade;\n      How often to check on all active orders and positions (some people like checking every day while others do it once per week).\n    \n  \n  \n    Learn to Read Charts\n\n    Charting is a big part of both forex and crypto trading, although crypto and forex each have a different sort of typical chart patterns.\n\n    Charts are a visual representation of market activity. They are used to help traders make decisions, identify trends and support and resistance levels, identify chart patterns, and much more.\n\n    The best way to learn how to read charts is by reading them once a day for a few months until you become comfortable with what they look like when they're \"normal\" or \"strange\".\n  \n\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nI hope this list was helpful in giving you a better understanding of how to try trading forex and see if it is a good fit for you.\n\nIf you are a crypto trader, you probably know that there are ways to trade all sorts of TradFi instruments in tokenized form, but if you are serious about trading those assets, you should look into their own platforms.\n",

      content: "Jump to the walkthroughs:\n\n  Converting on a decentralised exchange\n  Converting on a centralised exchange\n    \n      Walkthrough for no-KYC USDC-USDT market on Phemex\n      Walkthrough for KYC stablecoin trading on FTX.com and FTX.us\n    \n  \n\n\nUSDT, or Tether, is the world’s most transacted stablecoin. USDT is meant to always be worth $1.00, its purpose is to be the cryptocurrency to be used for storing  or transferring value denominated in USD without the volatility of cryptocurrencies.\n\nThere’s a couple of other stablecoins out there. Right now the second most popular stablecoin is the Circle owned USDC.\n\nBoth USDT and USDC are IOU stablecoins, which means that they are backed by fiat assets worth enough to match the issuance of new stablecoin tokens.\n\nThe collateral is not publicly known except in broad strokes:\n\n  We know that Tether holds a lot of US treasury securities and decreasing amounts of commercial debt papers, but we do not know how are these financial holdings structured, what is done with the earnings those papers might yield and many other things.\n  We know that USDC is backed by US treasury securities and some other assets: Report from June 2022\n\n\nThat means that if you hold a stablecoin, you are taking a risk. This is because you cannot know if the collateral of the stablecoin is really in good standing. If it isn’t, you will not be able to exchange your stablecoin for the equivalent value of US dollars and you will lose money.\n\nStablecoin attacks are non-events until they aren’t\n\nAttacking various stablecoins has been a mainstay in the crypto industry, it happens every now and then. Sometimes it proves justified, the stablecoin de-peggs and its holders may lose money permanently.\n\nMost often it all ends up being a non-event, though. People will flee from one stablecoin to another and after a few weeks the storm blows over.\n\nI think it’s reasonable to flee. The market can test the management of a stablecoin with someone else’s money.\n\nIn this guide I will go through the ways of how to convert USDC to USDT, or the other way around - USDT to USDC. There is a couple of fast ways to do that.\n\n\n\nConverting stablecoins on a DEX\n\nShould you convert USDT and USDC on DEX or centralised exchange?\n\nYou can do both. You can exchange USDT and USDC either on centralised exchanges or you can use DeFi swaps. CEX will be a little cheaper and technically easier.\n\nThe reason is that stablecoins are based on different blockchains.\n\nThe blockchain you choose matters a lot: A stablecoin on BSC has far lower transaction fees than the same stablecoin on Ethereum, and not all wallets support all variants of stablecoins.\n\n\n  \n    Let’s take SUSHISWAP for instance.\n\n    The DEX has a swap between USDC and USDT. In this swap, both stablecoins are on Ethereum.\n\n    If you have USDT on Ethereum and you want to get USDC on Polygon, you would have to first buy USDC on Ethereum and then bridge the Ethereum token to Polygon.\n  \n  \n    CEX lets you do the same conversion in a single step.\n\n    That’s including switching the chains.\n\n    Centralised exchanges let you deposit USDT on most available blockchains and they trade all of them on the same market. That’s because on a CEX, trading doesn’t happen on-chain, it’s all just numbers printed on screen.\n\n    It works the same way if you buy a stablecoin on a CEX. You will only first specify on which chain you want it when you submit a withdrawal request.\n  \n\n\n\n\nConverting stablecoins on a CEX\n\nConverting USDT to USDC on Phemex\n\nThe first exchange I’m going to list is Phemex, because they do not require KYC for withdrawing stablecoins.\n\nPhemex doesn’t trade or list any markets denominated in USD, it’s just stablecoins. The majority or markets on Phemex are denominated in Tether. You can’t even deposit or withdraw fiat, so this is not an exchange where you can cash out your stablecoin into fiat currency.\n\nBut if all you want to do is swap between USDT and USDC on different blockchains, they do that quickly.\n\n\n  Here’s the market: USDC/USDT on Phemex\n\n\nThe whole process of depositing, converting and withdrawing took me 10 minutes the last time I did it:\n\n\n\nHere’s how to sell your Tether for USDC via Phemex:\n\n\n  \n    Go to Assets &gt; Deposit\n\n    Generate a deposit address for the blockchain on which your Tether lives.\n\n    \n\n    The supported blockchains are Ethereum, Tron, Solana, Polygon, Binance Chain and Arbitrum One for USDT and USDC, and also Fantom for USDT.\n\n    The deposit will clear after as little as 1 confirmation. I was depositing USDT on BSC so that went pretty fast.\n  \n  \n    Head over to the USDC/USDT spot market to submit a buy order for USDC.\n\n    Link to USDC/USDT here.\n\n    The minimum traded amount is 10 USD worth.\n  \n  \n    Your order is listed just below the chart.\n\n    It will show up under Active Orders at first and then will disappear when filled. You can just wait a minute until it fills.\n  \n  \n    Head over to Assets &gt; Withdrawals.\n\n    Select USDC and choose from the different blockchains available.\n\n    \n\n    You will pay a withdrawal fee if you’re not KYC’d, plus there is a minimum withdrawal of 50 USD worth. I was withdrawing into USDC on Polygon with 0.2 USD fee.\n  \n  \n    Confirm the request via e-mail and 2FA.\n\n    In my experience they pay up within a few minutes.\n  \n\n\nYou could do the exact same thing starting from USDC and withdrawing USDT. Phemex likewise does not require KYC for that.\n\nNo other stablecoin markets are listed on Phemex though, only this one between USDC and USDT.\n\nConverting USDC and USDT on Bitforex\n\nJust for posterity, Bitforex also lists the spot market for USDC/USDT as Phemex and would be your alternative if for some reason you don’t want to use Phemex.\n\nBitforex likewise doesn’t trade fiat and doesn’t require KYC. They are a much smaller exchange however and reportedly paint trades copied from other exchanges.\n\nI’d recommend Phemex over them.\n\n\n\nConverting several smaller stablecoins into Tether on FTX (Intl and US)\n\nFTX is a low fee exchange that’s available around the world.\n\nThey run one international platform and one US platform.\n\nThe situation with stablecoin trading is exactly the same on both FTX.us and FTX.com.\n\nFTX is a good exchange for cashing out of stablecoin into fiat, for trading larger amounts and for exchanging between more exotic stables than the USDT and USDC.\n\nNone of the two versions of FTX lists stablecoin markets except USDT/USD. The trick to converting stablecoins on FTX is in using their open OTC app.\n\nIt doesn’t have limits like your usual crypto OTC would have, it’s just that the interface has no charts.\n\nRead below for walkthrough and screenshots.\n\nStablecoin trading on FTX US or FTX.com\n\nThis is how to sell or convert a stablecoin on either of the FTX duo.\n\n\n  \n    Deposit your stablecoin\n\n    FTX lets you deposit far more stablecoins than what you can find by browsing through the markets.\n\n    \n      Both FTX platforms support USDT, USDC, BUSD, TUSD and PUSD deposits.\n    \n\n    The choice of the blockchains is as you’d expect it: ETH, BSC, SOL, TRX or AVAX for both USDT and USDC, plus also MATIC for USDC.\n\n    \n  \n  \n    Trade stablecoins on the open market\n\n    The only listed market for stablecoins is Tether/Dollar.\n\n    So, if you deposited Tether, you can head over to the market for USDT/USD as you’re used to:\n\n    \n      FTX.us USDT/USD\n      FTX.com USDT/USD\n    \n  \n  \n    Trade stablecoins OTC\n\n    If you deposited another stablecoin, you will need to convert it outside of the listed markets.\n\n    FTX runs an automated OTC interface. This OTC interface is open and you won’t face limits on minimum traded volume. You will still trade with zero fees, though - the quote is final like in any other OTC.\n\n    \n\n    The way to access the OTC app from the exchange is buried deep in the top navigation, but it’s available to all FTX traders on these addresses:\n\n    \n      otc.ftx.com\n      otc.ftx.us\n    \n\n    You can do all your stablecoin trading here, using your exchange balances.\n  \n  \n    Request a withdrawal\n\n    In my experience they process withdrawals quickly.\n\n    Regardless, I think they are a good option only if you are looking to trade a large amount, cash out a stablecoin into fiat, or if you enjoy making your life extra complicated.\n\n    \n  \n\n\nSummary\n\nThe easiest way to swap two stablecoins on different chains is through a centralised exchange.\n\nPhemex is one of the most straightforward and smooth experiences available among CEX platforms.\n\nYou can also trade stablecoins quickly with FTX. They are a good option if you want to convert a stablecoin into fiat.\n",

While the principal ETH chain, and the ticker ETH, belongs to the merged Ethereum on a PoS algo, ETHW uses a Proof of Work algorithm to secure its network. ETHW is intended to be a viable cryptocurrency, learn more about it at Twitter.\n\nIf you held ETH balance on a centralized exchange like Bitfinex or FTX (Intl or US), you have by now received an ETHW airdrop in the same amount of coins as of the ETH you held through the Merge.\n\nIf you kept your ETH in a self-hosted wallet like Ledger, Trezor or Exodus, you can now access ETHW through a Web3 wallet.\n\nThe best Web3 wallet for the task is Metamask. The Metamask browser extension allows you to interact with any blockchain, you just need to specify its RPC address and several other details.\n\n\n  Warning: As a security precaution in case of replay attacks, it is best to move your ETH to a different address first, before you move your ETHW.\n\n\nHow to access ETHW if you’re not using MetaMask\n\nLedger wallet does not support ETHW at this time, but all hardware wallet owners who held their ETH on them have the option to plug in their device and load it using Metamask as the user interface.
