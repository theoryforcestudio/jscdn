<h3>introduction</h3>
This is an introduction to how the internet is built. You see, most people don't
know how this things works in the first place, even if they work in technical
areas. The only people that know are those that work in the higher end
networking areas of ISPs. But I figure that some background never hurt anybody
and since we all use this in one function or another I'd give a shot at briefly
outlining the structure of the global internet. And who knows? At some point
this information might actually be useful for you.
<p>
I'll keep the technical jargon to a minimum, or at least I'll try. A little.
<h3>an opening</h3>
The Internet is a massive world-wide interconnected network - not a network, an
interconnected one. That where the name Internet comes from. This means that
there are lots of networks out there that can talk to each other or use networks
that they're connected to to communicate with networks they're not connected to.
A single network can be built up of many things. Some networks exist only in one
datacenter, others are built up of national, international or intercontinental
links. The important thing here is that each network
- whatever its size, is controlled and maintained by one administrative entity
(usually a corporation). These networks are referred to as Autonomous Systems
(AS). Each AS is assigned a unique 16-bit number called an Autonomous System
Number (ASN).
<p>
Now for some administrative politics. There is a central organisation that deals
with assigning 'numbers'. This is the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
(IANA). They control the delegation of ASNs, IP ranges and other numeric
resources that require a central authority.  Historically they have directly
assigned IP blocks and ASNs to corporations or organisations, this is no longer
the case. As the Internet grew, seperate organisations were set up to deal with
this process. These organisations are called 'regional registries'. Broadly speaking
(very broadly,) there are three of these. They are organised geographically.
They are ARIN (American Registry for Internet Numbers), APNIC (Asian-Pacific
Network Information Center) and RIPE (Reseaux IP Europeen, which translates as
European IP Networks). These organistations can be found at,</P>
<ul>
<li><A HREF="http://www.iana.org/">http://www.iana.org/</A> - Top level
<li><A HREF="http://www.arin.net/">http://www.arin.net/</A> - North and
South America, Carribean and sub-Sahara Africa
<li><A HREF="http://www.ripe.net/">http://www.ripe.net/</A> - Europe,
northern Africa, the Middle East and parts of northern Asia
<li><A HREF="http://www.apnic.net/">http://www.apnic.net/</A> - Asia-Pacific
region
</ul>
<p>
When an organisation wants to build a network that actively participates in the
global internet (as opposed to simply buying traffic from an ISP), it will
request an ASN and IP allocation from the regional registry for their region. The most
important part is receiving an ASN (I will elaborate on this later) and after
that an IP allocation.
<P>
An IP allocation is one or more blocks of contiguous IP addresses that this
organisation receives and is unique to this organisation. Actually, this is not
entirely accurate. The IP allocation is tied to the ASN, but more on that later.
An organisation can have more than one ASN, this is usually the result of
mergers or acquisitions. The regional registries will not assign more than one ASN to one
organisation, but once two organisations merge then the new entity holds both
ASNs. Massive acquisitions have led to single organisations holding many ASNs,
but usually they will consolidate all IP allocations associated with these ASNs
to one single ASN and return the ASNs to the regional registries.  They will however hold
on to the IP allocations, as IP space is very valuable.
<P>
This brings me to a side note. IP addresses being sold by an ISP.  Many ISPs
charge money for assigning IP addresses to a customer company. This is
acceptable as it is a one time administrative cost, but IP addresses are not the
<B>property</B> of an ISP. IP addresses are granted to an ISP for connectivity
purposes. Any ISP that requires a company to pay a recurring fee for handing out
IP addresses is in violation of Registry policy. IP addresses are not property,
and the only money you can be charged by an ISP for an IP allocation from the IP
addresses they have been assigned is money that covers the administrative costs
they have. An organisation may not, under any circumstances, make a profit on IP
assignments. Many of them still do, because no-one feels like taking them to
court over it. Just one of the many things that are wrong on the internet... But
I thought I'd mention it. Smack the next sales person you encounter asking money
for IP addresses with this little tidbit, wiil you?
<p>
So after reading all this, you might want a few interesting links.<br>
Over here <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/ipv4-address-space">
http://www.iana.org/assignments/ipv4-address-space</a>
you can find a listing of all IP allocations by IANA. The notation used is CIDR,
so 212/8 is a massive block (class A in the old style) covering all IP addresses
from 212.0.0.0 to 212.255.255.255.
<p>
Here
<a href="http://www.arin.net/statistics/2001stats.html">
http://www.arin.net/statistics/2001stats.html</a>
you can find the total number of IP requests processed and AS numbers assigned
by ARIN in 2001.

<h3>transport, and why it matters</h3>
As we all know, IP is the transport mechanism of the Internet.  Network people
always talk about 'layers'. In this they refer to the OSI model. OSI stands for
Open Systems Interconnect. It is a model that was developed for universal
network-oriented communication in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The Internet
was built around a different model. Actually, there is not formal model that the
Internet was designed around, that idea came later. But the model is called the
DoD model - for Department of Defence. As we all know, the Internet evolved from
the DARPA network experiments. DARPA stands for Defence Advanced Research
Projects Agency. This is where IP and higher level protocols such as TCP, UDP
and ICMP were developed. The war between the DoD model and OSI model was a long
one, but OSI failed miserably in this. OSI has a 7 layer model detailing
everything from the physical transmission media to the abstract application
interfaces. The DoD model for networking won this battle simply because Internet
communications became the de facto standard.  The OSI model is still referred
to, but no-one in networking uses its concepts above layer 4 (where TCP and
friends reside). Basically, layer 1 and 2 refer to the physical media and the
ways in which signals are exchanged over these media (Ethernet is a layer 1 and
2 standard). IP is a layer 3 protocol, called the 'network' protocol.  TCP is a
layer 4 protocol (called the 'transport' layer). Higher layers of the OSI model
are called 'session', 'application' and 'presentation'.
<p>
This whole model works very well. The basics are pumped into each networking
newbie and are referred to at all levels. For LAN technologies running our
beloved TCP/IP protocols, that is. There are a lot of other networking
technologies out there, and once you start mixing datacom and telecom
technologies the entire model falls to pieces.
<P>
So IP is a network layer, not a transport layer. But that's just semantics. IP
is what's used to transport data across a network.  That's why I (and many
others) call it a transport mechanism. At layer 3 we find the routers, pieces of
network equipment that forward packets of data based on their IP addresses
(which are logical, not physical).
<P>
You might be wondering now how IP packets go from one place to another. This is
a very good question. On a local network you don't need IP, you can communicate
with other machines just fine using layer 2. Basically you just send a signal
onto the wire and, say, Ethernet will take care of the rest. But if you want to
go outside you'll want your packets to be routed. Think of routing as sending a
packet into a different domain. One that has no awareness of your physical
networking media. You don't really think that the machines at <A
HREF="http://www.google.com/">http://www.google.com</A> know if you're on a
dial-up link, DSL or a LAN connection, do you?
<p>
If you want to 'go outside', your packets will reach a router. A router has
multiple interfaces and a routing table. It receives your packet and looks at
where that packet wants to go. It then looks into its routing table to decide
which interface its going to forward that packet to. Most of the time your
packet will have a destination address that it doesn't know about. So it'll send
that packet to another router that is higher up in the hierarchy. If this packet
has to go onto the Internet, it will be sent upwards and upwards in the network.
Until it reaches the border of the network. Here it is passed to a router that
is connected to the Internet.
<p>
<h3>it's not getting any better</h3>
Now we reach the interesting part. You see, an ISP has to connect to the
Internet. It has to have some way of pushing IP packets to other networks. So
we're back at the beginning and the reason I'm writing this. Pushing packets
inside your own network is tricky enough. How to do this when you want them to
go outside? Well, there are several ways. Most ISPs have routers at Internet
Exchanges (IX s), also known as Network Access Points (NAPs). These Exchange
points usually have a common media (usually an array of interconnected switches)
that each member is connected to. Any two ISPs connected to such an IX can agree
to exchange traffic with each other. So if there are 50 ISPs on this IX they can
exchange traffic with each other, if they all decide that they want to. When two
parties agree to exchange traffic they become 'peers'. So now your ISP can
exchange traffic with all other ISPs on the switch that they have agreements
with. But this still limits the networks they can reach to those they are
peering with. An ISP in France isn't likely to have a peering agreement with an
ISP in Korea.<br>
For a list of Internet Exchange points, try <a
href="http://www.colosource.com/ix.asp">http://www.colosource.com/ix.asp</a>
<p>
So now we come to the Carriers. Carriers are networks that are vast and
intercontinental. They exchange traffic with other Carriers.  Examples of
Carriers are KPN/QWest, MCI/Worldcom, Level3, etc. An ISP will usually sign a
contract with one or more Carriers. The Carriers will then agree to accept
traffic for any network and send traffic from any network to the ISP network if
it's destination is that ISPs network.
<p>
So why were these ASN numbers necessary again? Well, these networks all build up
their routing tables based upon the ASNs. At this level, the routers are not
talking IP, they are talking another protocol, called BGP (Border Gateway
Protocol). Using BGP these routers tell each other their ASN numbers and the
ASNs they can reach. 
<p>
The routers make decisions on where they send their packets based on AS policy.
A Carrier will accept all traffic from an ISP router, but this costs money and
if the router can send the packets directly to the network it wants to reach via
the IX switch, it makes sense to use the switch because it is faster and
cheaper. But if an ISP doesn't have a peering agreement with the network it
wants to send data to then the router on the other side of the switch will not
accept the traffic, so it has to be sent via the Carrier.</P>
<p>
So at the heart of the Internet, routers don't look at IP addresses,
they look at ASN numbers and what the best path is to send traffic
to. Say a border router wants to send data to IP x.x.x.x. It will
look up this address in its routing table - a table that is the
result of BGP policy.
<p>
<h3>building pictures</h3>
All this talk about AS numbers and topology views will probably have you a bit
confused.  I promised you I would go easy on the technical jargon, and I have.
(well, OK, I haven't really).  But the concepts we're dealing with are a bit on
the abstract side, so a certain amount of jargon is necessary. "<i>_dose!</i>" I
hear you say, "<i>you are boring the crap out of me!</i>" And I hear you, and so
I present a pretty picture to liven things up a bit.
<p>
Consider this example of an AS topology,
<pre>
      AS-1 -----------                        - AS-21
       |              \---- (Carrier)--------/    |
       |                  /   AS-17  \            |
     [Exchange]          /            \          [Exchange]
     [ Switch ]         /              \         [ Switch ]
      |     |          /                \         |
      |     |         /                  \        |
    AS-2   AS-3 -----/                    ----- AS-42 ---- AS-33
</pre>
<p>
AS-1 can reach the rest of the ASs via the following paths:<br>
Over the exchange switch (via peering),
<pre>
AS-1 - AS-2
AS-1 - AS-3
</pre>
and over Transit (via the carrier),
<pre>
AS-1 - AS-17
AS-1 - AS-17 - AS-3
AS-1 - AS-17 - AS-21
AS-1 - AS-17 - AS-42
AS-1 - AS-17 - AS-42 - AS-33
</pre>
Apart from the fact that I will never be a graphic designer, the interesting
details we can glean from the AS paths and the map are,
<ul>
	<li>There is no path AS-1 - AS-3 - AS-17. AS-3 peers
	with AS-1, but does not allow AS-1 to use its network for transit.
	<li>Neither is there a path AS-1 - AS-17 - AS-21 - AS42.
	<li>AS-1 has two possible paths to AS-3, one is directly via peering and
	the other is via transit (AS-1 - AS-3 and AS-1 - AS-17 - AS-3,
	respectively).
	<li>AS-33 has no peering arrangements, and AS-42 provides transit for it.
	<li>AS-2 can only reach AS-1 and AS-3, but not the world outside the
	exchange switch.
</ul>
The terminology can be a bit misleading sometimes (especially with the more
esoteric constructions), but all routers that exchange routing information via
BGP are called neighbours. The difference between 'peer' and 'transit provider'
is that peers are equals and usually only exchange traffic that is bound to each
others networks. A transit provider asks money for accepting your traffic and
forwarding it to other networks.
<p>
Now, if you'd prefer to view some actual graphics, you can find an AS map of the
internet at 
<a href="http://www.caida.org/analysis/topology/as_core_network/AS_Network.xml">
http://www.caida.org/analysis/topology/as_core_network/AS_Network.xml</a>. You
might want to read the description to make sense of it, though.

<h3>complications</h3>
The internet edges are tricky places to work. And often the work here goes
wrong. Line failues, misconfigurations, updates going wrong and everyone's
favorite, one small mistake triggering a landslide of failures affecting many
networks.
<p>
Some say the Internet was designed to withstand a nuclear attack. This isn't
true. The original ARPANet was designed to withstand the complete failure of one
or two points, but the Internet as we know it today is a completely different
animal. Many of the original protocols and concepts are still with us (much to
the chagrin of security engineers), but the network has evolved into something
different. Often I hear people saying "Well, if the US-EU links go down, we'll
just route traffic via the Mid-East to Asia to the US West Coast, right?" Wrong.
Take a look at this picture,
<a href="http://www.telegeography.com/pubs/maps/internet/index.html">
http://www.telegeography.com/pubs/maps/internet/index.html</a> - the wallpaper
version at the bottom is a higher resolution. This picture shows us the
<b>intercontinental capacity</b> of the IP datacom networks. Do you really think
we could compensate for the US-EU loss by "routing that traffic somewhere else"?
That said, it's not very likely that all the fibres across the Atlantic would
fail at the same time. 
<p>
If it were to happen, though, it would disrupt business communications between
the EU and the rest of the world. It would disrupt private communications as
well, but these are of lesser impact. Small to medium businesses would hardly
notice, as most email and websites relevant to their operations are inside the
EU region. There is no particular element of regional operation that requires
the Americas to be reachable via the network. It might even improve productivity
in many workplaces, as Hotmail, Yahoo and assorted web comics would also be
unavailable :)
<p>
<h3>trusting systems</h3>
BGP neighbours basically tell each other which networks (ASs) they can reach and
which IP ranges are associated with these networks. This way, each router can
build their routing tables. However, there are generally few checks enforced on
the routes a router will accept from its neighbours. Each neighbour has to be
explicitly configured and after that is usually considered trusted.
<p>
In this way it is trivial for one router to announce IP ranges that don't belong
to it, and other routers will happily propagate this information over the
internet. Let's say that ISP-A accidentally announces an IP range belonging to
ISP-B. ISP-A will then receive an amount of traffic that is destined for ISP-B.
These things happen on occasion, and are generally fixed very fast. Operator
mailing lists will carry this information and if ISP-A doesn't fix it's
announcement, other ISPs will start to ignore its announcements. Effectively
isolating ISP-A.
<p>
These annoucements are however quickly noticed because an ISP will actively
monitor the announcements of its address space. It is a bit different with IP
address space that has not been assigned yet. This address space is called
<i>murky address space</i> because it does on occasion appear in the internets
routing tables. This is usually attributed to advanced spammers with a lot of
networking skills wishing to hide their tracks. They break into an ISPs routers
and adjust its BGP configuration to also announce unassigned address space
(which they use to send SPAM) after which they remove the announcements and
effectively disappear. These, and other advanced attacks of SPAM, scams, etc are
attributed to the dot-com fallout, which left a lot of very skilled people with
no jobs.
<h3>internet size and growth</h3>
Many people try to measure the size of the Internet in the amount of people
connected to it. This is of course, hopeless. But from a network engineering
point of view there are other ways of measuring both the size and the growth of
the net. The easiest to look up are the number of ASs, the amount of routes in
the Internet routing tables, the IP space allocated by regional registries and the
amount of traffic flowing through the main exchange points.
<p>
Currently, there are approximately 25,000 ASN assignments in use. The
total number of unique networks will be significantly lower after the enormous
amount of corporate mergers over the last few years. When two or more companies
merge (or one is aquired by the other), the ASNs and IP allocation for both will
still be held by the resulting company. It is considered proper behaviour to
merge the ASNs and announce all IP allocation under 1 ASN and return superfluous
IP ranges to the regional registry for re-allocation. However, this is a lot of work.
And as obtaining IP addresses in the first place requires a lot of paperwork,
most companies prefer to hold on to what they have.
<p>
A full Internet routing table holds approximately 120,000 unique routes today
(mid 2002), up from 20,000 in 1994.
A graph showing this growth can be found at
<a href="http://www.mcvax.org/~jhma/routing/bgp-hist.html">
http://www.mcvax.org/~jhma/routing/bgp-hist.html</a>. This impacts not just the
size of the Internet, but also the hardware necessary to process all these
routes. Keep in mind that these routing tables are dynamic and change from
minute to minute. Also, <b>each packet</b> traversing such a router has to be
matched against the routing table (with its 120,000 possibilities) to determine
its destination. Not just the capacity and speed of the hardware has improved to
meet this challenge, the software performing the actual routing has become
highly specialised to handle this. Additionally an Internet router usually has
multiple high-speed interfaces (each usually between 100 Mbit/s and 1
Gigabit/s).
<p>
So how much traffic is there on the Internet? Also an impossible question to
answer. A good starting point is however to view the traffic statistics of some
major Internet Exchanges. One of the major European IXs is the AMS-IX (Amsterdam
Internet Exchange), and its statistics can be viewed 
<a href="http://www.ams-ix.net/hugegraph.html">
http://www.ams-ix.net/hugegraph.html</a> here. Slightly over a year ago the
aggregate traffic via peering alone here was 2 Gbit/s, now it is almost 6
Gbit/s.  (As viewed in the monthly graph, in the daily graph we can see spikes
over 8 Gbit/s). In this area, MFN - Metromedia Fibre Networks / Above.net have
a large facility servicing IP traffic, with 9 public circuits carrying traffic
to and from this location internationally. The traffic graphs for each of these
circuits can be found here,
<a href="http://www.mfn.com/network/ip_networkstatus.shtm#ams">
http://www.mfn.com/network/ip_networkstatus.shtm#ams</a>. The circuits are SDH
STM-4 and STM-16s, 622.08 Mbps and 2.488 Gbps respectively. 
A high level overview of its network can be found here
<a href="http://www.mfn.com/network/ip_networkmaps.shtm">
http://www.mfn.com/network/ip_networkmaps.shtm</a>.
And MFN/Above.net is far from being the only Carrier in the game.
<h3>future</h3>
The dot-com bubble may have burst, but the Internet hasn't gone down with it. In
fact the net is still growing every day. Some providers go down, but there are
plenty of others waiting to sell Internet access just around the corner. Of
course this all costs money, but people want access. Much like the advancement
of the telecommunications industry post World War II, the Internet is bound to
keep on growing and probably take on a different, and more pervasive form in the
future.
<p>
Already there are plans on the table for interplanetary Internet communications.
We have the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems, <a
href="http://www.ccsds.org/">http://www.ccsds.org/</a>, to name one. And of
course the Interplanetary Internet Project <a href="http://www.ipnsig.org/home.htm">
http://www.ipnsig.org/home.htm</a>, in case you were afraid of ending up on Mars
without pornography.
<p>
I bet you were expecting a description of IP version 6 here, right? Sorry, I'll
write about that once it is more widely deployed.
