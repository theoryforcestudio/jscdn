<font size=+2><font color=blue>The Schroedinger cat and our searching labs</fonT></foNT> <br>
The very moment we start one of these labs, of course, a lot of people are 
going to begin searching around for the 
same (or analoguous) subjects. If you believe that this activity will 
not influence the quarries, think again. 
Our activities influence not only the search engines (that of course 
take note of every search, that's what they have been built and offered 'for free' for: to 
gather datas and use them) even the TARGETS we are searching for.
 Such a peculiar state of affairs would be a 
modest example of a Schroedinger cat.<bR>
I quote: "<font color="#3300CC">Schroedinger cat states are extremely fragile. Any interaction with 
the surroundings will destroy the superposition and the target collapses 
into a single entity (becomes ``decoherent''). As the separation is 
made larger, the cat state becomes more fragile; this is interpreted 
as the reason such states are never seen in the larger world of 
common experience.</fonT>". I believe this applies to Web-searches as well.<br>
While the Schroedinger Cat examples are used in Quantum phisic when considering 
the possibility that something could be made to be both dead and alive 
at the same time, what I am referring to here, is the fact that by interacting 
with the web you "move" the parameters of your very search. The more you search for a specific 
target (or the more people are searching it) the more "awareness" of your 
query you have, be it from bots or from humans. A classical example is the 
interpretation of searching patterns in order to attarct people to 
a specific site, used by 'first position' commercial spammers on all search engines.<bR>It would be nice if we could 
perform "non disturbing" workshops. But the sheer mass of people searching 
again and again for 
 the same specific targets listed on each  workshop has effects on those targets:
 to use the examples of the first three classrooms: after all trampling around 
by the searchers that read these pages Humphrey's museum may close, nn's useful proxies pages may disappear and Giglio's 
beloved Redhead pictures may be not so difficult to find any more.
