       There are some basic rules for seekers. Of course things are different depending from the KIND of search you are 
       performing. Please note that specific and often different advice and techniques 
       apply for <font color=blue>[</font><a target="_top" href="longtermsearching.htm">long term web searching</a><font color=blue>]</font>   
 versus   <font color=blue>[</font><a target="_top" href="tips.htm">short term web searching</a><font color=blue>]</font>. Also,

 The following 'rules' represent 
 <u>a general synthesis</u>, that should 
 apply most of the times.<bR><br>
       Almost every query can, and indeed should, 
       be subdivided into  five 
       steps<br><center><font size=+2>think, find, refine,  <font color=blue>[</font><a href="effective_searching.htm#evalla">evaluate</a><font color=blue>]</font>, collate</font>.<bR>
      (Mnemo_acrostic: <font color=blue>Th</font>e <font color=blue>Fi</font>nder <font color=blue>Re</font>verses <font color=blue>Ev</font>ery <font color=blue>Co</font>rner)
       <br> </center>
       	<ol><li>
           	 <b>THINK about your query</b><bR>              
                   Seekers do not "plunge" into 
                   a search out of the blue. Like artists, they visualize the correct result 
                   before they begin. The 'perfect' answer is driving their queries. The perfect answer <u>creates</u> 
                   the correct question(s)<br>
                   What kind of results do you want? Books? Doctoral thesis? Images?
                 News?  Biographies? How many results do you want? Three hundred pages of material? 
                 One single authoritative book? A dozen pdf-articles? 
                A short and concise essay?<br>
                   Obviously you cannot be an expert in all single field of  
                   any and every query you will launch. But you must 
                   be an expert in the field of finding the right resources for 
                   each and every kind of query.
                   <br>A seeker needs TWO skills: 
                   <font color=blue>to formulate a question correctly</font> and   <font color=blue>to know where to look</font>. 
                   And this means knowing which 
                   resources you should use for your searches. And this means you must first of all know how to search those very 
                   resources you should use for your searches.<br>
                     In fact each 'part' of the 
                   web requires a different approach. For instance, searches on <font color=blue>[</font><a href="usenet.htm">usenet</a><font color=blue>]</font>, on    
                   <font color=blue>[</font><a href="blog.htm">blogs</a><font color=blue>]</font>   or on <font color=blue>[</font><a href="ftp.htm">ftp servers</a><font color=blue>]</font>    are 
                   not ruled by the same <font color=blue>
                    lore</font>. 
                   Also each  <font color=blue>[</font><a href="targets.htm">kind of target</a><font color=blue>]</font>, each  quarry, 
                   requires a different approach:   for instance 
                   when searching 
                   <font color=blue>[</font><a href="newsfeeds.htm">news</a><font color=blue>]</font>, <font color=blue>[</font><a href="images.htm">images</a><font color=blue>]</font>   or <font color=blue>[</font><a href="books.htm">books</a><font color=blue>]</font>.  
                   <br>You must also decide if  for a given query you will have to use 
                   <font color=blue>[</font><a href="combing.htm">combing</a><font color=blue>]</font> techniques like <font color=blue>[</font><a href="stalking.htm">stalking</a><font color=blue>]</font>, 
                  <font color=blue>[</font><a href="luring.htm">luring</a><font color=blue>]</font> or <font color=blue>[</font><a href="trolls.htm">trolling</a><font color=blue>]</font>  .
                   <br>Before even beginning, think about your query: <font color=blue>prepare your question(s)</font>
                    for the perfect result and <font color=blue>decide which resources you will use</fonT>.
           <bR><br>
</li>
<li>
	     <b>FIND what you are looking for</b><bR> Easier said than done, I know.  
	           In fact this  very complex step is  at the same time the whole point of the exercise. 
	           However, depending on the previous "thinking about your query" step, you will at least already know <u>where</u> you should be looking for and 
	           what kind of <u>techniques</u> you'll have to use.<bR> 
	           A general advice is to <font color=blue>[</font><a href="combing.htm">comb</a><font color=blue>]</font>   as much as you can, i.e.  
	           use the knowledge that others have gathered. Search those that have already searched, 
	           and do not 'reinvent the wheel' at every query!  <br>A second generally useful advice is to go 
	           <font color=blue>[</font><a href="regional.htm">regional</a><font color=blue>]</font> as much a you can, i.e. always use 
	           		information and resources that are located on the same plane (geographically, temporally, academically, conceptually)  as 
	           		your quarry.
	           		<br>Anyway, if your      <font color=blue>question has been formulated 
	           	correctly</font> and  if you already <font color=blue>know where to look</font>, the 'finding' part will not 
	           		be too hard.   Still, you'll find a lot of "irrelevant" results, especially if 
	           		you wanted more <font color=blue>[</font><a href="Luxembourg_2006.htm#recallprecision">recall than precision</a><font color=blue>]</font>. 
	           		That's why 
	           		 "finding" a lot of stuff is not enough. <font color="#0000FF">The lore of refining, evaluating and collating 
	           		these broad results</font> is of outmost importance for the educated seeker.
	           		 <bR><br>
</li>
<li>
	    <b>REFINE while searching</b><bR> 
	    
Your queries are usually either too wide or too narrow. Usually -in fact- they are too wide. If a subject is too wide, 
as it is most of the time, you have to limit and narrow your search. 
Using boolean operators (<font color=blue>AND</font> and <font color=blue>NOT</font> or <font color=blue>+</font> and <font color=blue>-</font>) will narrow the search adding and/or eliminating terms. You can also limit 
your query temporally (for instance only <font color=blue>2005/2006</font>), geographically 
(for instance only <font color=blue>.ru</font>) or formally (for instance only <font color=blue>.pdf</font> 
files).   <br>
These limits allow you to restrict results to items meeting specific criteria. I.e.:
 a particular type (newspaper articles, journal articles, complete books, small snippets of text); 
 a particular language (English, German, Spanish, Russian, Italian, French, etc.);  
a target published or produced within a particular time frame (2000-2004)<bR><br>
</li> 
<a name="evalla"></a> 
 <li>
	    <b>EVALUATE your results</b><bR>  This is easier said than done, again. The <font color=blue>[</font><a href="evaluate.htm">evaluation 
	  phase</a><font color=blue>]</font>   is of paramount importance, but -alas- far from being simple. <bR>Whatever you are looking for, 
	    you are bound to find very good quality results, good quality results,    average quality results and poor quality (or no quality at all) results. 
	    This is not only due to the web-pervasive and omnipresent commercial spam, but also 
	    to the simple fact that the web allows anyone and his dog to publish anything he (or his dog) fancies.<bR>
	    A possible approach to evaluation is to use as a rough guide the seven 
old classical questions: <font color=blue>quis</font>, <font color=blue>quid</font>, <font color=blue>ubi</font>, <font color=blue>quibus 
auxiliis</font>, <font color=blue>cur</font>, <font color=blue>quomodo</font>, 
<font color=blue>quando</font>: Who, What, Where, Helped by whom, Why, How and When. <br>
<br>Well, first of all you should maybe ask yourself <font color=blue>why the heck</fonT>  you need to search for something at all&nbsp;:-) <bR>
Continue only if you have an answer to this fundamental question.
<br>
<bR>If you  manage to answer the fundamental question and continue,  
whenever you find  a result, it is useful to ask yourself  for evaluation purposes 
the whole bag of classic questions. <br>
(Does not take long and helps a lot&nbsp;:-)
<br>Let's begin: <font color=blue>quis</font> WHO is the Author (and therefore, given his 
biography,  
what qualifies him to write about the matter at hand);    <font color=blue>quid</font> WHAT is in fact the result you found 
(a complete  explanation, 
a proof of concept, a small addition, an hypothetical solution...);  check   <font color=blue>ubi</font> WHERE you did find your result (look at the URL, 
look at the server, look at the links pointing to it...); <font color=blue>quibus 
auxiliis</font>, WHO helped the Author? (look at who OWNS the server hosting the result, look at eventual references, links, etc...);
         and ask yourself <font color=blue>cur</font>: WHY the result has been produced and put on the web;  <font color=blue>quomodo</font> HOW the result 
         has been produced (again, similar to quid/what: years of research or one half-afternoon sudden jerk?);  
         and finally 
         <font color=blue>quando</font>: WHEN was the result produced/published/updated, <u>when</u> was the web site created/updated.  
         (in fact 
         <font color=blue>[</font><a target=_top href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.searchlores.org">archive.org</a><font color=blue>]</font>  
           may prove 
         <font color=blue>[</font><a href="effective_searching.htm#disapp">invaluable for any kind of dating purposes</a><font color=blue>]</font>. 
         Note that you can also retrieve a site for 
         <font color=blue>[</font><a target=_top href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010418160531/www.searchlores.org/">specific 
         date</a><font color=blue>]</font>   of the 
         past).<bR><bR>
         Simply answering the seven "classical" questions  will already allow you to proceed towards a proper evaluation of a set of results. <bR>
          <bR>Finally a word about those "ready-made" evaluation tips you can find on the web. Should you use them? Yep, <i>Cum grano salis</i>.  
          <bR>
          First of all there's a tendency to ignore "grey areas" of the web when evaluating targets. Some self-appointed "evaluators" 
          for instance  seem  to believe that  
          a pdf file should automagically, <i>eo ipso</i>, be more worthy than an html file, 
          independently from its actual content.<br> 
          No way!  
          A text is not worth anything 
          just because it has been printed and published in a book.  
          Its worthiness must always be judged only anhand 
          its <font color=blue>[</font><a href="evaluate.htm#siela">intrinsic</a><font color=blue>]</font> value.  
          Many ready-made 'evaluations tips' you can find on the web 
          are blinded by formal frills, bells and whistles 
           and tend to bow with excessive bias towards the rather limited 'academical' 
          web-subset. What's worse: many 'evaluators' are often  utterly 
          incapable of judging the content they encounter at face value, i.e. <u>behind</u> the formal aspect.
          <bR><br>This IS indeed a major problem: some of the most interesting lore on the web, some of the 
          most advanced internet techniques  are discussed   and developed in small  circles 
          of geeks  located all over the world    that may, or may not, 
          know english well enough to satisfy an 'evaluation purist' 
          and that -in any case- will not always use a clean (nor a politically correct) english.<br><br>
          It may also be worth noting that -in general- east european places (<font color=blue>.ru</fonT>, 
                     <font color=blue>.bg</fonT>, <font color=blue>.cz</fonT> etc.) are still  
                      less commercially oriented -for cultural and historical reasons- and therefore 
                     offer a more "sound" valid evaluation habitat, for books, software, products and targets, 
                     than the bogus 
                     <font color=blue>[</font><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan_(aficionado)#Fanboy">fanbois</a><font color=blue>]</font>   "evaluations" 
                     recensions that are purposely  planted on all amazon- or ebay-style places.    
                     In fact on our "euroamerican" slice of the web you can nowadays hardly find a non-paid  
                     (sorry: <a href="http://humanities.byu.edu/rhetoric/Figures/E/epanorthosis.htm">I mean non-biased</a>&nbsp;:-) 
                     review 
                     or comparison of such targets.
                      <bR>
<br><br></lI>
	    
	  <li>
	    <b>COLLATE your results</b><bR> 
	   Ok, you have performed a long search. Gathered tons of results. Painstakingly weeded out bogus and crap sites, 
	   understood which are the 
	   most important, the 'authoritative' results... and now you might stop your search and sleep satisfied.<br>
	   Nope. This would be a serious mistake: a web-query <font  color="#0000FF">is not finished when you have found your results</font>. Most 
	   will be lost if you don't COLLATE your results, squeezing the most authoritative 
	   results into a coherent and valid interpretation. A 'conclusion' of sort.
	   <br>Systematic record keeping is OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE when searching. A classical mistake 
 is to 'forget' to keep records during  complex searches.<br>
For this purpose I suggest you simply use the NOTE function in <font color=blue>[</font><a href="tuttiope.htm">Opera</a><font color=blue>]</font>  : just highlight the target 
text you are interested in, 
rightclick, and then choose <font color=blue>copy to note</font> (or use the keyboard shortcuts, either
 CTRL+SHIFT+C or CTRL+ALT+E depending on the version of Opera you'r using): 
*the URL* of the page you'r viewing at that moment *and the date* will be automatically stored in your note 
*together with the highlighted text*.<br>
You may want to create ad hoc <font color=blue>note folders</font> (for instance 
"<font color=blue>books_abot_assembly_MAY_2006</font>") and, at the 
end of your search, before switching the computer off and sleep, just move all your 
related notes inside some correctly named folders. 
<bR>Opera's Notes are just text format, very easy to edit, 
cat, search or prune.<br>
Alternatively use <u>something</u> to take notes, even a pen and a sheet of paper will do. DO NOT rely on your memory alone (or on your 
extraordinary seeking capabilities to re-find at once what you may have lost&nbsp;:-)<br>
If you do, you will regret it. Sooner 
than you believe.<br><br>Once you create some crumbs-paths of well kept records, collating the results will be 
a quick and easy process.<bR>
    <bR>
</lI>

<lI><b>A final note about our "searching environment"</b><bR>  Listening to music while searching   is NOT a good idea,  chatting 
	while searching is NOT a good idea, being interrupted while refining a query is also unhelpful.<br> 
Always search & seek <font color=blue>in a quiet and relaxed environment</fonT>, 
with as few disturbances as possible. No disturbing 
music, no telephone, no skype, no email distractions, no IRC, no chat 
(and of course no TV, duh). <bR>
A serene, calm atmosphere, will allow you to 
take full advantage of your seeking efforts in an optimal way.  
<bR><font color=blue><center>Serenity CREATES serendipity.</center></fonT> 
This does not have to mean soberness, austerity or ascetics, though. 
If you fancy something to drink, have it ready before starting, and always chose excellent wines,  
superb (i.e. belgian) beers or 
the most finest teas.
<bR><bR>Let's cut it short: Seekers should   -maybe-  
paragon themselves to <font color=blue>monks of the early middle age</fonT>, sitting in their  
peaceful cells, seeking old forgotten 
knowledge, sipping good wines, while all those barbarians and zombies are burning everything in sight 
-and torturing each other- 
 not far from our virtual abbeys' walls...<br><br>...yep: consider yourself a literate monk of the early middle ages among 
 dangerous savage (and braindamaged) barbarians 
because this 
is exactly what you are, both on the commercially polluted web and in your commercially polluted real life.
