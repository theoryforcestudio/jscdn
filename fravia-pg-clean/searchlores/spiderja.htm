<br><Font size=+3> A Tale of the Spider in a Jar</font><br><br>

It is the many spiders of the web that help us to find what we
seek to know. They crawl tirelessly about the web while recording
their journies in order that we may find those places where they
have been. These spiders are many and include those such as
Scooter, Slurp, Gulliver, fido and many more. They build the
indexes we search at AltaVista, HotBot, Northern Light and
elsewhere in our quest for knowledge. While these spiders toll to
ease our journey there is much knowledge they never see and thus
fail to record. Knowledge hidden amongst the multitudes of
worthless articles on the web which pretend to convey knowledge or
that knowledge which is hidden in private webs that aren't indexed
by those spiders which crawl only on the main web for lack of a
route to the knowledge kept in private webs.
                                                   <br><br>
This is where the story begins of the spider in a jar. There are
actually many of these about the web laying quietly along the
edges. These spiders only crawl their own little space and are
kept from the larger web of the internet. They crawl the small
private webs of the universities and private business making a
journal of the knowledge hidden within that is normally not
visible or diluted with many irrelevant places making them hard to
see. The journals of these spiders contain only records from a
small private web or a limited topic from the larger web. Using
these journals for your queries can help filter the many worthless
sites that may be given by the unrestricted spiders.
                                                      <br><br>
What's that you say? Where can we find these spiders? You must
search for them in their hiding places. To find them you can use
the journals of the free roaming spiders that usually pass over
these smaller spiders but record there location. Let's begin with
locating a small spider to help us relax while we are searching or
working about other tasks, a spider that works to record cocktails
:-) While you should already have the recipes on hand for an
assortment of helpful cocktails you may wish for something
different or if you are a newbie you may need to begin with a
place to look. Try searching Scooter's index at AltaVista with the
query "cocktail search" or try the link<br><br>
<a href="http://www.altavista.com/cgi-bin/query?pg=q&sc=on&hl=on&q=%22cocktail+search%22&kl=XX&stype=stext">http://www.altavista.com/cgi-bin/query?pg=q&sc=on&hl=on&q=%22cocktail+search%22&kl=XX&stype=stext</a><br>
<br><br>and you will be returned a list of
pages which contain search tools which will only look up cocktails
:-) They will contain nothing else in their index to dilute your
results. In one fell swoop you have filtered all of the irrelavant
returns.          <br><br>

Perhaps you do not need a new recipe for a cocktail but wish to
find a spider that indexes Legal Resources on the web. We can
begin with a search of scooter's journal with +search +legal or
+search +law where we will have returned to us some links to
spiders which record only pages related to law. With these spiders
we can search to find answers to questions on the law that might
otherwise be difficult to locate in the diluted results of the
free roaming spiders. If you wish to search for pages of medicine
try +search +medicine and you'll have returned you some spiders
which index only medicine. Quite an elementary task is this to
find journals where the knowledge is more pure.
<bR><br>
These searches will return mainly spiders which roam freely over
the large web will contained within the topic of the jar which
contains them. There are spiders though which only crawl on small
webs on the inranets of universities. These webs contain a wealth
of knowledge which is totally invisible to the free roaming
spiders. Perhaps in the example of medicine above you wish only to
find the spiders of places like medical schools. Again, quite an
elementary task. We add to our search above, +search +medicine
domain:edu so that we are returned only the pages that have both
of the terms search and medicine in the edu domain. We could do
the same for anything we want to find from the schools from art to
zen.
              <bR><br>
Now it is time that you shall work. Go forth and find spiders from
art jars, programming jars, wine jars and more. Look over the web
with all of the spiders you can find for all the little spiders
that are trapped as servants to their small fields of knowledge
where the big spiders cannot go. Find the ones that roam the big
web and record only the pages for which their jar was made to
hold. Among them you will find many which will help you to find
the knowledge where only they have gone...
