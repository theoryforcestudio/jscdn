<br><b>Searching scarcity: Steganography and just-in-time info on the web</b><br>
<br>by Jeff</font> <br>
<br>slightly edited by fravia+, published @ <a href="https://searchlores.nickifaulk.com/www.searchlores.org">searchlores</a> 
in <b>December 2001</b><br>
<hr><i>
Coupla months ago, helding another seminar in Brussels for EU-officials, I explained 
that knowing how to search the web is of paramount importance, inter alia for all 
those 'rootgrass' 
organisations of the 'civil society', desperately trying to 
save or ameliorate a world that has -alas- been left 
 hostage of the big commercial corporations and
their lobbies (with the corresponsability of all local, national and european
 administrations).<br>Somebody asked for an example of 'civil society related' 
 search, and in that 
very moment a noisy jet passed over the town. A classical example: those that 
make their money with transports (and airports) couldn't care less about disturbing a 
million people (nor about killing somebody, think at all the risks connected 
with planes flying over densely populated areas) whenever the fly routes allow them to 
spare a few bucks and the political lackeys are so corrupt to stay mum.<br>So we searched, 
and we quickly found among other things <a href="http://www.boeing.com/assocproducts/noise/brussels.html">this 
document</a>... the public was duly impressed</i>&nbsp;:-)<br><i>The reason of this lenghty 
introduction is to have readers remember that we are not just 'seeking for the sake of it'. 
Armed with the  techniques and approaches <u>we seekers</u> are able to teach, 
rootgrass organisations 
may dig out of the web all sort of appropriate documents and information and 
counter many an evil deed and plan. Indeed transparence is a 
powerful democratic weapon 
in a society that is getting more and more 
oligarchic. This essay moves along this path: but ~S~ 
Jeff will show you not only how 
to find, on 'civil society' request, an useful -and hard to find- document, but also 
<u>how to hide 
it again</u>&nbsp;:-)

  <P>Hi fravia+<BR>
  <P>Well as you know I can't write essays; I shouldn't have called 
  it<BR>'essay' at the board; It's, rather, just my notes.<BR>


  <P><font size=+2>In Search of Scarcity&nbsp;:)</font><BR>
  <P>The Target is a Paper that Forseti was looking for, named: 
  "<font color=blue>Water Scarcity in the Twenty First Century</font>"<BR>
  <P>This search came about in a <a href="http://www.ebmb.org/mbs/mbs.php3?since=1&amp;view=extend&amp;num=1007836456&amp;thread=1007821162">thread</A>
  at ebenezers when forseti posted that he would like a particular article 
  that he still had not had time to find :) In addition GoW was looking for a 
  project to do for xmas, and fravia+ suggested a searching project.<BR>
  <P>Several of us went on the hunt (and you will find some great links 
  and ideas in the minds of the searchers as they looked for this article 
  in the thread above)<BR>After what seemed a long weekend, and many attempts, 
  using many combinations of search terms gathered as I read hundreds of 
  pages... I finally brought up what I was looking for.<BR><br>
  
  <font size=+2">I found it... and I decided to hyde it inside an image</font>
  <P>After I found it, it suddenly occurred to me that its exposure in<BR>google 
  was not so forthcoming (it was that, or people just were not<BR>spending as 
  much time on it as me, and hense it just hadn't been found<BR>yet :) So since 
  a searching project had been mentioned, i thought to<BR>make it a little bit 
  more interesting, since the  document lay buried in<BR>several legs of a 
  journey.<BR>
  <P>I decided to take what +mala, Alice, dan, and harlequin had taught 
  me,<BR>and wrap the search into a color puzzle for all those participating 
  in<BR>the document search.<BR>
  <P>I wanted to keep this very simple and very exposed to viewing; this 
  is<BR>not to say that for peoples <b> unexposed to this type of handmade 
  color<BR>stego scheme</b> that it would be simple; but i figured it 
  would be<BR>fairly easy for some.<BR>
  <P>handmade xmas gifts<BR>
  <P>this is a handmade 'color stego' puzzle.<BR>(thanks go to Harlequin for 
  patiently teaching me one way to write this<BR>variation in a different 
  image)<BR>
  <P>The target image is here: <A 
  href="http://pweb.jps.net/~jas/santa1.gif">santa1.gif</A><BR>
  <P>tools needed:<BR>uedit or peek<BR>Paint shop pro or a paint 
  program<BR>ascii chart<BR>
  <P>time needed: about 5-10 minutes depending on your familiarity with 
  the<BR>tools<BR>
  <P>After doing a search for santa, [since it was a xmas search 
  project<BR>after all] it occurred to me that if my project was to involve a 
  'stego'<BR>of a sort, then one of the first things to come into someones 
  mind,<BR>after the teachings at the fortress stego pages, was that they 
  would<BR>think that they would need to 'compare' my image to an 
  'original<BR>image'...<BR>That is not so in this case... it is possible to 
  break this handmade<BR>steg without the original... but<BR>For those who might 
  take that thought path I decided to take some more<BR>teachings from 
  searchlores to make that a possibilty for them.<BR>
  <P>From image searching we have learned to try to identify the time 
  period,<BR>the country, the style, the dress, etc of the image subject... so 
  in<BR>this case i tried to make the santa an identifiable search 
  subject;<BR>rather than happazardly scanning thousands of santa image 
  returns...<BR>I picked russian... doing an image google search of :<i> 
  russian santa<BR></i> you would have been able to locate this santa 
  image. Although i<BR>slightly changed the file name so it wouldn't make it 
  tooooo easy, the<BR>pixel size is the same, although the content lenght has 
  changed :) ...<BR>So if you want to compare the 2 files and find the changes; 
  then thats<BR>one way to do it.<BR>
  <P>a few other ways to bust this <i> without finding, and using, 
  the<BR>original:</i><BR>download and save the gif<BR>
  <P>Now one of the things that I have recently learned is that a gif 
  file<BR>has a set file size found in the header area; this means that you 
  can<BR>add anything on at the very end of a gif file without it 
  interfering<BR>with the gif file itself on execution.<BR>It also means that if 
  you decode the file size header and it says it<BR>contains 100 bytes; but, if 
  your file size properties menu tells you<BR>that the file size is 120 bytes 
  .... hummmm, you better look deeper<BR>
  <P>If you open this gif file in uedit, for example, and hit ctrl+end 
  (or<BR>scroll to the end)<BR>you will see that I left you a clue in 
  text...<BR>[note: if you do not have a hex editor, or uedit specificaly, you 
  can<BR>always RENAME the gif file too <i> .txt </i> and open in 
  notepad...<BR>scrolling to the end you will find the same message]<BR>the 
  message reads:<BR><b>Peeking R you? :) Follow the Light !! 
  </b><BR>[Peeking was another clue but thats for another explanation 
  below]<BR><i>Follow the light!!</i> ... was hopefully to ZERO YOU 
  in on looking at<BR>the lantern<i> light</i> in the santa 
  image.<BR>
  <P>If you open in paint program (paint shop pro is what I am using) 
  and<BR>Magnify that lantern greatly, you will very quickly see an area in 
  the<BR>latern at the top that has a very unusal color string that seems to 
  be<BR>foreign to the picture and out of place... (if you have found 
  the<BR>original you will know immediately it doesn't belong there, and, so 
  it<BR>must have been added :) I could have disguised it much better but I 
  left<BR>it out in the open ... its my intention for you to have fun doing 
  this<BR>and not make it so tough that it wasn't any fun... I perfer hansel 
  and<BR>gretle trails :)<BR>
  <P>So, what does the color string mean?<BR>The pixels are made up of different 
  colors generated by the RGB Values<BR>in a color pallette; obviously the RGB 
  colors that used to inhabit the<BR>co-ordinates of this area have been 
  changed... but to what??? :)<BR>(I am not going into HOW TO create this 
  string) but in psp (if you have<BR>it) take your eyedropper tool and place it 
  on the first pixel color, in<BR>the string; at (314, 133) ... look over at 
  your RGB values (depending on<BR>your version) ...<BR>what do you see in 
  RGB?<BR>
  <P>R=70<BR>G=111<BR>B=108<BR>the combination of these 3 colors produced the 
  color of this first<BR>pixel... note down the values<BR>
  <P>place the eyedropper on the second pixel color... look to RGB<BR>R= 
  108<BR>G= 111<BR>B= 119<BR>
  <P>do you have an idea of where we are going with this yet???<BR>How to 
  decrypt it?<BR>take out your ascii chart.... what does dec 70 equal?<BR>
  <P>
  <pre>       70= F
      111= o
      108= l
      108= l
      111= o
      119= w
      </pre>
  <P>I leave the rest of the color string message for you to 
  decipher...<BR>follow it to a place that can tell you where to locate the 
  elusive<BR>document...and when you get there you may find that you have 
  some<BR>further work to take you way back in time :)<BR>
  <P>Exposure number two:<BR>This color string can also be read in another way, 
  though you will never<BR>see the color string text in its gif form.<BR>Open 
  the gif in psp<BR>you'll note it is in 8 bit, 256 colors (harley explained to 
  me why this<BR>next proceedure to read the hidden text cannot be done in 8 bit 
  but I<BR>forget because i really didn't understand it) but the gist of the 
  matter<BR>is that to produce what we want to be able to see, and read, we 
  must<BR>convert this gif to 16 bit.<BR>we can do this by 'increasing colors' 
  to 16 million, and then we Must<BR>SAVE the 16 bit file as a <i> .raw 
  </i> file.<BR>
  <P>Now when you have the santa1.raw file, a very convient tool to have 
  and<BR>use is PEEK... right click the raw file and choose peek... 
  it<BR>produces/generates/ a nice txt file with the color string converted 
  to<BR>TEXT--- scroll til u see the text that seems to make some since to 
  you<BR>:) ... Follow ----<BR>
  <P>
  <P>**********<BR>if you are still working on the above proceedure donot read 
  beyond this<BR>point unless you want it spoiled for you.<BR>
  <P>**********<BR>

  <font size=+2">Finding 'just in time' info on the web</font>
<br><br><font color=blue>Target/Signal/Task</font>: The Paper 
  "<i>Water Scarcity in the Twenty First Century</i>"
  <P>I have tried numerous keywords (and by watching the lists that come 
  up<BR>to the top that have not been clicked on previously) I continued to 
  look<BR>into all the returns looking <i> for quotes</i>, or for an 
  ellusive 'old<BR>url address link'...<BR>The search brings up many many many 
  great articles on world water<BR>papers... but alas the great majority of the 
  returns are of the<BR>reference index type for the specific query, with no 
  direct links other<BR>than vvf's password protected source site.<BR>(anybody 
  bust that one yet?)<BR>
  <P>finaly this search: <i> intitle:Water Scarcity in the 
  twenty-first<BR>Century</i><BR>gave me these returns:<BR><A 
  href="http://http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=intitle%3AWater+Scarcity+in+the+twenty-first+Century">Water+Scarcity+in+the+twenty-first+Century</A><BR>
  <P>its simplicity staggers me, after all I have used The Title of 
  this<BR>paper over and over in my searchs and this url (below) never seemed 
  to<BR>come up.<BR>but using the term:<i> intitle:</i> reveals 
  several I haven't clicked on<BR>in the last 3 days :)<BR>
  <P>links 1-2 don't seem relevant at a glance<BR>links 3-4-5 i had already 
  previously looked at (highlited red)<BR>so<BR>the 6th link, worldbank.org 
  ---would--- give up the ghost...<BR>(in fact worldbank.org has its own search 
  engine and inputting The title<BR>of the paper (with exact phrase) generates a 
  page return with <A 
  href="http://http://pacific.worldbank.org/ext/results.jsp?RESULTS_SERVER=extweb27.worldbank.org%3A5000&amp;DOC_QUERY_TERMS=water+scarcity+in+the+twenty+first+century&amp;QUERY_TREATMENT=PHRASE&amp;x=14&amp;y=4">2 
  links</a> with the title  "Water Supply and Sanitation at the World 
  Bank" that go to <A 
  href="http://www.worldbank.org/watsan/topics/economics.html">topics/economics.html</A><BR>
  <P>oh great; just plain old fashioned sheeee-it... i just know its going 
  to<BR>be another one of those damned referenced index pages when I click 
  on<BR>it... arrrrgg..<BR>but my hair stands up on end<BR>on this 
  economics.html page at bottom (FINALLY) the reference area has a<BR>URL 
  address!!!!... this is what I have kept my eye peeled for; FINALLY!,<BR>for 
  even if it is a dead link there are still a couple of possibilities for accomplished searchers:<BR>1. The dead 
  link may have been archived at archive .org<BR>2. Someone may have kept the 
  file name the same, and a search of the<BR>filename may produce it 
  elsewhere.<BR>
  <P>the ellusive link on this page is:<BR>
  <P><a href="http://www.cgiar.org/iwmi//WB1Cover.htm">Water 
  Scarcity in the Twenty-First Century</a><BR>Seckler, David, 
  David Molden, and Randolph Barker, International Water<BR>Management 
  Institute, 1999.<BR>
  <P>...and the dam link--- is indeed 404<BR>
  <P>but, the first try at the wayBack machine webarchive produces 
  the<BR>prize!! :)<BR><A href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.cgiar.org/iwmi//WB1Cover.htm">http://www.cgiar.org/iwmi//WB1Cover.htm</A><BR>
  <P><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19991103164511/http://www.cgiar.org/iwmi/WB1Cover.htm">Water Scarcity 
  in the Twenty-First Century</a><BR>[I must say though...my heart skipped 
  a beat when the page came UP...<BR>YEsssssss there it was!!!! Then my heart 
  stopped !!!, for all I saw on<BR>the Page was a few sentences....!!!!! I sat 
  stunned for several moments<BR>in defeat... and then I noticed the LINKS at 
  the TOP of the page ...<BR>wheeeeeew! :)<BR>
  <P>...so WB1Cover.htm == Water Brief 1<BR>
  <P>now that we have a filename lets see if anyone has published<BR>it...<A 
  href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=inurl%3AWB1Cover">inurl%3AWB1Cover</A><BR>
  <P>nope... thank goodness for webarhcive :)<BR>
  <P>the page has 7 links and only 5 work... the maps and tables links 
  were<BR>not archived by archive.org... :(<BR>
  <P>but i had a thought... the address contains a DATE in 
  the<BR>URL...19991103164511<BR>Nov. 3rd 1999 (I am not sure what 164511 
  is?)<BR>so I changed it to 19991103 and viewed it/ only one return... then 
  had<BR>another thought that it was only giving me a return FOR Nov 3rd<BR>so i 
  changed it again to read only /1999/<BR>this produced three updates for the 
  whole year here:<BR>
  <P><A href="http://web.archive.org/web/1999*hh_/www.cgiar.org/iwmi/WB1Cover.htm">1999*hh_/www.cgiar.org/iwmi/WB1Cover.htm</A><BR>
  <P>but earlier archives didnt have the maps and tables pages either 
  ...I<BR>assume that webarchive just doesn't grab that type of stuff 
  then...<BR>(haven't checked but its probably stated in the FAQs page )<BR>
  <P>on further checking for tables and maps ...googles image search 
  for<BR>Scarcity.gif did not seem to bring up the specific pages i wanted 
  for<BR>the missing links... however forseti wrote me and said:<BR>
  <P>...snip...<BR><i>And here's where it get's interesting... the link to
