<font size=+3>Why</font>
<br><br>

<font size=+1>
Let's begin from the beginning. In a world that is getting more and more 
intrusive on our private lifes, finding some (simple) methods to protect 
our privacy is a <i>sine qua non</i> for the survival of knowledge spreading. 
<br><br>
The society we live in recalls more and more "<i>Fahrenheit 451</i>", Ray Bradbury's classic, 
frightening vision of a future  where 
firemen don't put out fires--they start them in order to burn books.<br> 
A society that holds up the appearance 
of happiness and success as the highest goal -- a place where trivial 
information and commercial crap is good, and real knowledge and independent 
ideas are bad.

<br>Hence the need to defend ourself. Seekers must have the means to communicate without 
the clowns at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECHELON">Echelon</a> snooping their messages 
<hr width=33% align=left></font>
(<a href="http://www.heise.de/tp/english/inhalt/te/6929/1.html">Echelon</a> 
is a  snooping 
project paid by the 
United States' National Security Agency (NSA) that 
includes stations run by Britain, Canada, Australia and 
New Zealand, in addition to those operated by the United States: 
a block of anglophones elites helping 
each other against the rest of the world and their own citiziens, as it seems... note that Ireland is not 
part of it...  
one could begin to wonder if England leaders 
should be allowed to remain in the European Union,  having  
 transformed a glorious european country into something that looks like a supine 
'fifth column' of the United states&nbsp;:-)
<hr width=33% align=left><br><font size=+1>
As the (dutch) authors of contraband 
wrote: "<font color=blue> Steganography tools are the NSA's worst nightmare, 
if you're smart you'll understand why...</font>". 

<br><br>It is therefore a pleasure for me, in these 
times of warmongerish madness,  
to (try to) teach everyone in sight how to "deceive the deceivers".<br> 

The more people will learn these tricks, and the more those clowns will have to 
work to snoop our private data, the better.<br><br>   

"<font color=gray>In the information age, we need to re-learn a 
very old lesson. Despite the sophistication of 
21st century technology, today's e-mails are as open to the 
eyes of snoopers and intruders as were the first crude radio 
telegraph messages. Part of the reason for this is that, over 
many decades, NSA and its allies worked determinedly to limit
 and prevent the privacy of international telecommunications.<br> 
Their goal was to keep communications unencrypted and, thus, 
open to easy access and processing by systems like Echelon.<br> 
They knew that privacy and security, then as a century ago, 
lay in secret codes or encryption. Until such protections become
effective and ubiquitous, Echelon or systems like it, will remain
 with us.</font>" 

<br><br><hr>

This said, let me point out once more that if you really need absolute secrecy, 
the BEST "simple" privacy device is nowadays simply 
uploading and downloading PGP encrypted files while
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardriving">wardriving</a> in a different part of the town  
with a portable *<a href="Helsinki_.htm#bigbro">you bought  cash</a>* in another State, and that you use ONLY FOR THIS (of course spoofing its Wifi-MAC address, every time different,
 when 
wardriving&nbsp;:-)
<br><hr>
But steganography will do almost as well, from home and without hassles&nbsp;:-)

<br><br>

<font size=+3>What</font>
<br><br>

The word steganography is derived from greek and means &quot;coverted writing&quot;, from 

<font color=blue>stegein</font>: to cover... the same root as in Stegosaur, a quadrupedal, herbivorous 

ornithiscian dinosauar of Jurassic films celebrity and early Cretaceous times, well 

known for being quite 'covered' through an armor of triangular bony plates on 

his back spine.<br>

<br>

Steganography is the art (and science) of communicating hiding THE EXISTENCE of 

communication, in contrast with cryptography. Ideally, your enemies, or those 

you are fighting against, or even your friends, should not even imagine 

that there IS a message 

concealed somewhere.<br>This very characteristic makes steganography the IDEAL 

science for hiding messages on the web, which is flooded by noise: non-significant 

data. Your whole passwords and everything you need can without any problem be 

hidden inside three or four 'fake' pages you'll have uploaded somewhere, with 

images like 'my sister Sally and her favourite banana fishes' or whatever.<br>You 

will download all fake images from the web (web homepages are a never ending source 

of incredibly dull lifes and fotographies :-), you will MODIFY them (the greatest 

risk for steganography is the confrontration between the 'original' image, without 

concealed message, and the 'steganated' image which contains a 
message, of course), and only after 

these modifications you will hide your concealed message inside them with one of 

the many programs ad hoc.<br><br>

Basically, using steganography, you can smuggle ("embed") any file, or set of files 
inside a format ("cover" or "container")

which leaves the smuggled data untraceable and unreadable ("stego": the final 
data containing both the cover noise and the embedded signal).
<br><br>
<font size=+3>Caveat</font>
<br><br>
    Be warned: you cannot trust all stego programs on the web, and you should 
definitely NEVER  trust any software you do not possess (or <a href="http://www.searchlores.org/srtools.htm">re-construct</a>) the source code of.<br>
See the <a href="bangla.htm">bangla</a> section for more info on gratis software you can trust.
<br>
<a href="http://www.pipo.com/guillermito/stegano/index.html">http://www.pipo.com/guillermito/stegano/index.html</a>: 
If a security software does not explain how it works precisely, 
don't trust it for serious purposes. 

 In 

general searchers love working with programs (and <u>onto</u> programs) they have been 
given  the source 

code of
(or else have "<a href="http://www.searchlores.org/softreve.htm">reconstructed</a>" it on their own&nbsp;:-)<br><br>I'm sure therefore that you'll 

appreciate the presence of the source code for all these programs, this will also 
allow you, if you feel like working a little, instead of just leeching <i>ad nauseam</i>,  

to delve pretty deep inside all mysteries and vagaries of our applied and 

advanced steganography.  Who knows, maybe hundreds of small new steganographical 
programs will blossom. Each one with a slight different embedding algo.<br> 
The NSA clowns, the Echelon wankers and all other slavemasters' lackeys 
will definitely love this&nbsp;:-)

<br><br>  

 Data and files can be hidden inside <a href="stego.htm#gra">graphic</a> files, 
inside <a href="stego.htm#mus">music</a> files, 
or even inside <a href="stego.htm#exe">executables files</a>, so we will divide the applications 
by <font color=blue>cover</font>.

        MP3Stego will hide information in MP3 files during the compression process.
The data is first compressed, encrypted and then data hidden in the MP3 bit
stream. Although MP3Stego has been written with steganographic applications in
mind it might be used as a watermarking system for MP3 files. Any opponent can 
uncompress the bit stream and recompress it; this will delete the hidden
information -- actually this is the only attack we know yet -- but at the 
expense of severe quality loss.

 "<font color=gray>Hydan steganographically conceals a message 
into an application. It exploits redundancy in the i386 instruction  
set by defining sets of functionally equivalent instructions.<br>
It then encodes information in machine code by using the
appropriate instructions from each set.<br>
Features include:<br>
- Application filesize remains unchanged<br>
 - Message is blowfish encrypted with a 
user-supplied passphrase before being embedded<br>
- Encoding rate: 1/150<br>
Hydan can be used to watermark (fingerprint) code, 
sign executables, or simply create a covert communication channel.</font>"

The program snow is used to conceal messages in ASCII text by appending 
whitespace to the end of lines. Because spaces and tabs are generally 
not visible in text viewers, the message is effectively hidden from casual 
observers. And if the built-in encryption is used, the message cannot 
be read even if it is detected. <br><br>
