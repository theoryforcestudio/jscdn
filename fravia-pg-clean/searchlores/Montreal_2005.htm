</i><br><br>
</center>
<br><font size=+1>
Excuse my English, please, which in fact is not even my first foreign language, mais je craigne que mon francais soit ancor pire, 
hence I'll stick to english.
Please also note that I'm not always going to be politically correct, a severe handicap of mine. For instance
 I understand "copyright" as just "the right to copy" as much as I fancy. In fact 
some of the things that we'll see together today could be misinterpreted  as 'malicious', 'inconvenient' or even 'slightly illegal' 
in some "copyright obsessed" countries. But finding out  and explaining how things work is one of the many tasks of 
the reverser, as everyone here knows. And we must fullfill it, even in face of adversities and persecution&nbsp;:-)
<br>
<bR>
Another defect of mine is that I find "powerpoint style" slides during talks pretty disgusting: I use htm code instead. 
I'm sure you'll be deceived, but at least you can 
follow this talk on your own screens 
using <a target=_top href="http://www.searchlores.org/montreal_2005.htm">http://www.searchlores.org/montreal_2005.htm</a>.
<br>
<br>
With this talk I would like to give you some <font color=blue>cosmic power</font>, no more and no less.  
<br>
Of course in one hour we wont be able to examine the many searching techniques in depth.
I would just like to see with you some paths that are useful to search effectively the web.
Just build on your own onto what you'll hear today and you wont need nooune 
nomore to explain <i>you</i> anything: you'll always quickly fetch your  own 
signals among the heavy commercial noise that infests the web. 
<br>
<br>Please try to understand <font color=blue>the reasons behind</font> the querystrings we will see together, don't 
just count on the 
querystrings themselves: 
the specific arrows we will launch today will not remain "sharp" for long: everytime I use 
a querystring to make a point during a lecture, that same 
querystring is often immediately re-used many times over a very short time span,
 thus 'affecting' the web. <br>
A sort of <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=schroedinger%27s+cat&sp=1&_adv_prop=web&ei=UTF-8&vst=0&vf=all&vm=i&fl=0&n=10&SpellState=n-45894059_q-1WFts7Se4g1vVINk1BgMZgABAA%40%40">schroedinger's 
cat</a> effect:  like arrows, our new sharp querystrings -once used-  slowly become blunt. Do not worry: 
your skill and understanding 
of the web will allow you to produce new, sharper ones. As many as you want.
<br>

<br>
Note also that most examples -though valid no matter which operating system you'll use- 
will apply here to  <a href="leet_windozer.htm">windoze</a>, that I am using right now.<br>  
While I believe that GNU-Linux  is much 
better (<font color=blue>not</font> "Linux":  "Linux" does not exist. The name is <font color=blue>GNU-Linux</font>), I still 
prefer to use windoze as a matter of "cracking preference": it's waay more fun 
(and useful) to <a href="srtools.htm">reverse programs</a>  and operating 
systems you do not happen to have the source code of&nbsp;:-)
<br>
<br>
The interesting side of a commercial infested web is that those very databases that have been 
created in order to sell (or to hoard) files (huge repositories of musics, books, images, software, you name it) 
lay open , or -ahem- 
"<a href="dpl.html">next to open</a>", 
at our disposal, once we learn some basic searching skills. Also: there's not only a 'commercial web' to explore and conquest. 
The web of knowledge 
is still alive and kicking, albeit unconfortably buried underneath the sterile sands of the commercial desert.
<br>
<br>
In fact seekers possess a "double edge": a seeker knows how to find <font color=blue>the free knowledge</font> that the web still 
offers underneath the  morasses of frill, AND he knows how to enter the commercial databases and liberate knowledge 
<font color=blue>that someone does not want to be free</font>.
<br>
<br>
<font size=+2> <font color=blue>
The web was made for SHARING, not for selling and not for hoarding</font>, so -as we will see- 
its very "building bricks" deny 
to the commercial vultures the possibility of enslaving parts of it.
</font>

<bR><br>
 Once you know how to search the web and become "a seeker", 
 the entire human knowledge will become available, at your command and disposal, no matter where, or how, somebody may have "hidden" it.<br><br>
Let's start with a simple example, let's  imagine we would use google "like Joe Luser"
 in order to search some anti-streaming
 software for free, let's say we want to find "total recorder" (more on anti-streaming software <a href="Montreal_2005.htm#music">later</a>): <br><center></font>

 <a target=_top href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&c2coff=1&q=%22index+of%22+warez+%22total+recorder%22&btnG=Search">"index of" warez "total recorder"</a>
 </center><br><font size=+1> Alas, 
 this blunt and broken arrow will have your target signal 
 submerged under such a heavy commercial noise that the results will be next to useless.<bR> 
 Try clicking the resulting links: commercial crap -in this case-  
 mostly by the wankers at <a target=_top href="http://search.biz.tm">http://search.biz.tm</a> 
 that have spammed google "� la va banque", tarning their useless 
 services  
 as legit google results (the <a target=_top href="http://www.nic.tm/index.html">tm suffix</a> is a  
  hiding place for all sort of
 web-spammers. Good search engines should simply delete all tm sites from their indexes). 
 <br><br>
 So the query we just saw is seriously flawed. What kind of arrow should we use instead?<br>
 Well, a query like the following should cut more mustard:
 <br></font><center>
 <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&c2coff=1&q=%28%22wares%22+OR+%22warez%22+OR+%22appz%22+OR+%22gamez%22+OR+%22abandoned%22+OR+%22pirate%22+OR+%22war3z%22%29+%28%22download%22+OR+%22ftp%22+OR+%22index+of%22+OR+%22cracked%22+OR+%22release%22+OR+%22full%22%29+%28%22nfo%22+OR+%22rar%22+OR+%22zip%22+OR+%22ace%22%29+%2B%22total+recorder%22&btnG=Search">("wares" OR "warez" OR "appz" OR "gamez" OR "abandoned" OR "pirate" OR "war3z") ("download" OR "ftp" OR "index of" 
 OR "cracked" OR "release" OR "full") ("nfo" OR "rar" OR "zip" OR "ace") +"total recorder"</a>
 </center><br><font size=+1>
Btw, note how useful such a query is even WITHOUT the specification <font color=blue>+"total recorder"</font>.

<br>
This is just a simple example, and using just one of the <a href="main.htm">main</a> search engines. 
Always remember "<i>google alone and you'll never be done</i>":
there are many good and powerful search engines: 
at the moment the most important ones are <a href="google.htm">google</a>, 
yahoo (with its <a target=_top href="http://mindset.research.yahoo.com/search.php?p=philtron">philtron</a> slider), 
msn (with its wondrous <a href="https://searchlores.nickifaulk.com/&lt;br&gt;">sliders</a>), and <a href="teoma.htm">teoma</a>. 

<br>
<br>Btw, I hope you know WHY there are so many search engines. Basically for the same reason that my site is apparently quite 
messy and labyrinthical... <IMG SRC="images/bulletr.gif" ALT="red" align="bottom" valign="bottom" WIDTH="13"
HEIGHT="13">&nbsp;
<br>
<br>

Just repeating a given query
 with different engines will give you slightly different results, notwithstanding their overlapping and  the fact that altogether the 
 search engines
cover -at best- just slightly more than  <font color=blue>just a third</font> 
of the whole web... <IMG SRC="images/bulletr.gif" ALT="red" align="bottom" valign="bottom" WIDTH="13"
HEIGHT="13">&nbsp;
<br><br>

Let's first have a short look at what  <a href="Montreal_2005.htm#structure">the web looks like from a searcher's point of view</a>.
<br>
<font color=blue>Outside linkers</font> are fetched through klebing (and stalking and social engineering), 
<font color=blue>the bulk</font> and the <font color=blue>outside linked </font> 
through combing and short and long term seeking, the hidden and commercial databases through 
<a href="password.htm">password breaking</a> or <a href="magicfi.htm">guessing</a>, social 
engineering or, more simply, just seeking one of the many lists of 
databases' 
hardcoded passwords  (� la 
<a target=_top href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&safe=off&as_qdr=all&q=borland+%22politically+correct%22+interbase&btnG=Search">Borland Interbase's 
"politically correct"</a>) on the web. <br>Here for instance one of these lists: 

  <a target=_top href="http://www.searchlores.org/defpasslist1.htm">defpasslist1.htm</a>, here a <a href="dpl.html">better one</a> (and 
  you may also want to delve into some common php scripts <a href="Montreal_2005.htm#note_3">pestering php commercial voltures</a>)
<br>
<br>
To -quickly- fetch his targets, a seeker needs to "wade"  through the slimy commercial morasses of the web,
made specifically "ad captandum vulgus", and to  "cut" 
all the useless ballast.
<br>
<br><center><font size=+3>The Sword</font></center><br>

But when you need to "cut" the Web  your arrows, even the best ones,  wont be enough: 
you'll need first of all a SWORD, a sharp blade: <font color=blue>a capable and quick browser</font>. 
<br><br>
That's the first and foremost 
tool of a seeker. MSIE, Microsoft Internet explorer is a no-no-no, buggy, bloated and prone to all sort of nasty attacks. The 
two current "philosophical  schools" are either Firefox or <a target=_top href="http://opera.com/support/tutorials/tips/">Opera</a>... which is the quick browser I  
 mostly use for a plethora of <a href="tuttiope.htm">reasons</a>... <IMG SRC="images/bulletr.gif" ALT="red" align="bottom" valign="bottom" WIDTH="13"
HEIGHT="13">&nbsp;<br>
<br><center><font size=+3>The Shield</font></center><br>
Whichever  browser you use, no sword will be enough without a SHIELD. And your shield, 
and a mighty one for that, is <font color=blue>proxomitron</font>. <br>
Proxomitron is a very powerful tool. Its power lies 
in its ability to <font color=blue>rewrite webpages on the fly</font>, <font color=blue>filter communications between 
your computer and the web servers of the sites you visit</font>, and to <font color=blue>allow easy management of external proxy use</font>.
<br>
Here a 
link to an old, but very good essay about proxomitron basic installation: <a href="anony_8.htm">anony_8.htm</a>, and a link 
to 
another essay, <a href="proxopro_1.html">Oncle Faf goes inside proxomitron</a> about further fine-tuning.... Let's sum it up: 
<i>"Only morons 'just do it' without <a target=_top href="http://www.searchlores.org/zipped/ProxN44.zip">Proxomitron</a>."</i>

size=+3>WHY PROXOMITRON</font><br>(The 'rapidshare' example)</center></td></tr></table><br><i>The web was made for sharing

</i><br><br>
</center>

Among the many useful uses of proxomitron, its filters offer more speed to the seeker: as an example let's use proxomitron to nullify the 
time waiting span imposed by <a target=_top href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&c2coff=1&q=rapidshare.de%2Ffiles&btnG=Search">rapidshare</a>.<br>
Rapidshare is one of those "upload repositories" where people can upload large files. It allows unlimited downloads. There are many other similar repositories:<br>
<a href="http://www.yousendit.com">YouSendIt</a>: 1 Giga max, after 25 downloads the file is removed<br>
<a href="http://www.sendmefile.com">Sendmefile</a>: 30 Mb max, after 14 days the file is removed<br>
<a href="http://www.megaupload.com">Megaupload</a>: 500 Mb max (!), after 30 days unused the file is removed (like rapidshare)<br>
<a href="http://www.qfile.de">qfile.de</a>: 50 Mb max, after 30 days unused the file is removed (like rapidshare)<br>
and so on...<br>
<br>
Rapidshare searches <font color=blue>are worth a small digression per se</font>: Let's imagine you are interested in, say "oracle":<br>
<a target=_top href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&c2coff=1&q=rapidshare.de%2Ffiles+oracle&btnG=Search">rapidshare.de/files oracle</a> (or, 
using MSN's sliders: <a href="http://search.msn.com/results.aspx?q=%7Bfrsh%3D94%7D+%7Bpopl%3D20%7D+%7Bmtch%3D99%7D+rapidshare.de%2Ffiles+oracle&FORM=QBRE">{frsh=94} {popl=20} {mtch=99} rapidshare.de/files oracle</a>)
<br>
Such kind of searches will give the seekers aplenty fruits:

Alas! Rapidshare, while useful, has a silly commercial attitude with 
an annoying "delaying" trick.<br>
Let's have a look at it,
fetching a book, that could maybe prove  of some interest for 
some of the worthy colleagues that have gathered here today: <br>
<a target=_top href="http://rapidshare.de/files/1709371/Wiley.Reversing.Secrets.of.Reverse.Engineering.Apr.2005.eBook-DDU.zip.html">http://rapidshare.de/files/1709371/Wiley.Reversing.Secrets.of.Reverse.Engineering.Apr.2005.eBook-DDU.zip.html</a>

<!-- secrecy.ayinfo.ha.cn/jiemi/%B8%FA%D7%D9%B5%F7%CA%D4/NuMega.DriverStudio.v3.0Beta2.rar -->
<br>here is an example of rapidshare 'delaying' javascript code, which  runs on client side:</font>
<pre>
&lt;script>var c = 58; fc(); function fc(){
if(c>0){document.getElementById("dl").innerHTML = "<b>Download-Ticket reserved. Please wait " + c + ' seconds.
<br>Avoid the need for download-tickets by using a <a href="https://searchlores.nickifaulk.com/en/premium.html">PREMIUM-Account</a>. <font color="red">Instant access!</font></b>';
c = c - 5;setTimeout("fc()", 5000)} else {document.getElementById("dl").innerHTML = unescape('
%3C%68%32%3E%3C%66%6F%6E%74%20%63%6F%6C%6F%72%3D%22%23%43%43%30%30%30%30%22%3E%20%44%6F%77%6E%6C%6F%61%64%3A%3C%2F%66%6F%6E
%74%3E%20%3C%61%20%68%72%65%66%3D%22%68%74%74%70%3A%2F%2F%64%6C%31%2E%72%61%70%69%64%73%68%61%72%65%2E%64%65%2F%66%69%6C%65
%73%2F%31%34%33%38%37%35%39%2F%32%37%37%35%37%30%39%37%2F%4D%63%47%72%61%77%5F%48%69%6C%6C%5F%4F%72%61%63%6C%65%5F%41%70%70
%6C%69%63%61%74%69%6F%6E%5F%53%65%72%76%65%72%5F%31%30%67%5F%41%64%6D%69%6E%5F%48%61%6E%64%62%6F%6F%6B%2E%72%61%72%22%3E%4D
%63%47%72%61%77%5F%48%69%6C%6C%5F%4F%72%61%63%6C%65%5F%41%70%70%6C%69%63%61%74%69%6F%6E%5F%53%65%72%76%65%72%5F%31%30%67%5F

}}&lt;/script>
</pre><font size=+1>
In this case you would just use following proxo filter (by Loki):
<font color=blue><pre>

Active = TRUE
URL = "*rapidshare.de*"

</pre></font>

The other limit  of rapidshare, the '<font color=blue>just one download</font>' limit (that I bet some of you have already 
encountered in the past few minutes&nbsp;:-) can of 
course also be circumvented, for instance using <font color=blue>rotating anonymous proxies</font>, a task made easy(<a href="Montreal_2005.htm#note_1">*</a>) 
by our good ole <font color=blue>PROXOMITRON</font>. <br>
Alternatively you can flush and request a new IP address:<br>
Start --> run --> cmd.exe --> ipconfig /flushdns --> ipconfig /release --> ipconfig /renew --> exit<br>
Erase your cookies and reconnect to rapidshare.

<br><br>
Morale of the whole story? Shap sword + Powerful shield (+ good arrows) =  as many useful books (inter alia) as you wish.

<br>There's a whole section regarding <a href="books.htm">books searching</a> at <a target=_top href="http://www.searchlores.org">searchlores</a>, 
and you can delve into it by yourself. Suffice to say that (almost) all books mankind has written 
are already on the web somewhere, 
and that while we are sitting here dozens of fully scanned <font color=blue>libraries</font> are going on line: 
if you'r attentive enough, 
and if your searching scripts are good, you can 
even hear the clinking "thuds" of those huge databases going on line...  
<IMG SRC="images/bulletr.gif" ALT="red" align="bottom" valign="bottom" WIDTH="13"
HEIGHT="13">&nbsp;<br>
For instance, fitting for Quebec: <a target=_top href="http://gallica.bnf.fr/scripts/catalog.php?Sujet=%22Quebec%22">http://gallica.bnf.fr/scripts/catalog.php?Sujet=%22Quebec%22</a>  
which is part of the following search engine: <a target=_top href="http://gallica.bnf.fr/">http://gallica.bnf.fr/</a> and of its huge database of books, not only in 
french: 
<a target=_top href="http://gallica.bnf.fr/scripts/catalog.php?Sujet=%22Rhetorique%22">http://gallica.bnf.fr/scripts/catalog.php?Sujet=%22Rhetorique%22</a>.
<br><br>
There are many  huge 
databases of books on the wide web. Private, public, educational or commercial? It is irrelevant for seekers.
In order to fetch your target you just need  some correct strings, i.e.  -as usual- 
some sharp arrows.<br>

A banal, yet useful approach is starting from <a target=_top href="http://a9.com/-/search/advSearch">the powerful A9 engine</a>, 
for instance, for Conan Doyle,
 <a target=_top href="http://a9.com/conan%20doyle?a=obooks">http://a9.com/conan%20doyle?a=obooks</a> 
 and then fetch its own <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0553328255/ref=sib_rdr_next3_ex17/102-1260521-5632156?%5Fencoding=UTF8&p=S00P&ns=1#reader-page">study 
 in scarlet</a>.
 <br>
 Of course once we have <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22He+is+sure+to+be+at+the+laboratory%22+%22returned+my+companion.%22&num=100&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8">some 
 sharper arrows</a>, it is 
 relatively easy to fetch whole copies of a given book onto the web at large...
<br><br>
This is  true for all kind of copyrighted books as well... let's see:
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&c2coff=1&q=%22Suddenly%2C+caught+by+the+level+beams%2C+Frodo+saw+the+old+king%27s+head%22&btnG=Search">"Suddenly, caught by the level beams, Frodo saw the old king's head"</a>...
<br>
and we land here, for instance: <a target=_top href="http://www.angelfire.com/theforce/ring/book4/Chap7b4.html">Suddenly, caught by the level 
beams, Frodo saw the old king's head: it 
was lying rolled away by the roadside. `Look, Sam!' he cried, startled into speech. `Look! The king has got a crown again!'</a> 

<br>
<!--
<br>A typical example of the joys of good web-fishing: 
<a href="ftp://ftp.cdut.edu.cn/pub3/">ftp://ftp.cdut.edu.cn/pub3/</a> let's see if you can imagine, "a ritroso" the querystrings you may 
use to fetch such a site and the "onion peeling" of such an URl you could immediately perform 
 (this kind of 'reversing' approach is 
 a useful seekers' exercise as well).
 <br>
 -->
 <br>
 Finally, try out (and understand) this arrow:<br>
 <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&q=-inurl%3Ahtm+-inurl%3Ahtml+intitle%3A%E2%80%9Dindex+of%E2%80%9D+%2B%28%E2%80%9C%2Febooks%E2%80%9D%7C%E2%80%9D%2Fbook%E2%80%9D%29+%2B%28chm%7Cpdf%7Czip%29+%2B%E2%80%9DFor+Dummies%E2%80%9D&btnG=Search">-inurl:htm 
 -inurl:html intitle:�index of� +(�/ebooks�|�/book�) +(chm|pdf|zip) +�For Dummies�</a>
 <br><br>
 or maybe you prefer this one?<br>
 <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&q=-inurl%3Ahtm+-inurl%3Ahtml+intitle%3A%22index+of%22+%2B%28%22%2Febooks%22%7C%22%2Fbook%22%29+%2B%28chm%7Cpdf%7Czip%29+%2B%22o%27reilly%22&btnG=Search">-inurl:htm -inurl:html intitle:"index of" +("/ebooks"|"/book") +(chm|pdf|zip) +"o'reilly"</a>
 
<br><br>
(anyway at the moment with books even <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&q=%22index+of%22+oreilly&btnG=Search">banal arrows</a> 
will deliver whatever you want)

RULES <ol><li>
buy laptop cash elsewhere (not with credit cards and not where they know you)</li><li>
wardrive in another part of the town, not the one you live in</li><li>
download only, or if you upload, upload only anonymous things or PGP encrypted stuff </li><li>
rotate your wifi card mac address at every access point: I use "Macmakeup" </li><li>
use wardriving laptop ONLY FOR THAT, no personal data whatsoever on it </li></ol>

TECHNIQUES <ol><li>
Find speedy, beefy first wifi accesspoint with netstumbler: there are so many unprotected at all that you don't even need to 
   bother firing a wep-packets-analyzer to crack weak WEP-encryptions </li><li>
connect, browse, download, all shields down, javascript, java, the whole bazaar: who cares? </li><li>
ISP "A" will register everything "he" does. </li><li>
work half an hour, download the helluja out of it, upload with care</li><li>
walk/drive ten meters: change access point</li><li>
ISP "B" will now register everything "another he" does. </li><li>
work half an hour, download the helluja out of it, upload with care</li><li>
walk/drive ten meters: change access point </li><li>

<br><i>a taste of the seekers' web: some <a href="images.htm">images</a> (pr0n & nopr0n)

</i><br><br>
</center><!--
An interesting story about one of the many contradictions of the web: things change all the time and they remain the same.
<br><br>
A little history: last year you could find, with the very simple trick: <a target=_top href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&c2coff=1&q=80456+80265+80314+%22index+of%22&btnG=Search">m4a collections "index of"</a>
this page of google, with a link to <a target=_top href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&c2coff=1&q=80456+80265+80314+%22index+of%22&btnG=Search">Index 
of /collections/NWR/audio/m4a</a>. This is, or rather was, the "lair" database of new world records ("the Recorded Anthology of American Music). 
Using "ma4" instead of mp3 bypassed (at that time) google's "mp3 search" censorship algos.
<br>
Since I spoke about it in various previous conferences of mine, the web moved, and 
they abolished this direct access possibility.

<br><br>
The only remaining track of this huge (and nice) database of american music is the googled CACHED PAGE 
<a href="http://66.102.9.104/search?q=cache:VkhMGeEfAkMJ:128.122.108.69/collections/NWR/audio/m4a/+80456+80265+80314+%22index+of%22&hl=en&start=3">Index 
of /collections/NWR/audio/m4a</a>, that I have copied below, coz soon or later it will disappear from google's cache as well).
<br><br>
<a href="indexofcollectionsnrwaudiom4A.htm">indexofcollectionsnrwaudiom4A.htm</a>



Notice how all these numbers don't (and did not) say nothing about 
the content, unless you use their ad hoc database: <a target=_top href="http://www.newworldrecords.org/cgi-bin/search2/start.pl">http://www.newworldrecords.org/cgi-bin/search2/start.pl</a>
<br><br>


Now let's search where they may have moved the whole suff :-)<br>

<a target=_top href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&c2coff=1&q=%2280265-9%22++Darktown+Is+Out+Tonight&btnG=Search">"80265-9"  Darktown Is Out Tonight</a>
<br><br>
As you can see, in the results there is also a track of a discussion we already had on our messageboard when the previous lair was still accessible.
<br><br>
What's this? <a target=_top href="http://dram.nyu.edu/dram/Objid/5265">http://dram.nyu.edu/dram/Objid/5265</a>
<br><br> Could it be so simple?<br>

<a target=_top href="http://dram.nyu.edu/dram/80265-9.mp3">http://dram.nyu.edu/dram/80265-9.mp3</a>
--><br>
Let's have a look at the depths of the web...<br>

<br><br>
A search engine for <a target=_top href="http://www.angio.net/pi/bigpi.cgi">GREEK PI</a> number sequences... (pointed out by 8~) on a sunny Juny day)
<br>Ok, that's boring... let's see...
<br>

Uhmmm. Is this a "mature" audience?<br>

<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&c2coff=1&q=intitle%3Aindex.of+%2Bplaymates+-hot+-%22free+pics%22+-filetype%3Ahtm+-filetype%3Ahtml&btnG=Search">intitle:index.of +playmates -hot -"free pics"  -filetype:htm -filetype:html</a>
<br><br>
Or, if you want something more vulgar,
<!-- http://unleashedlust.com/blnd3/ --> 
<br>
<a target=_top href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&c2coff=1&q=%28blnd3+OR+blonde3+OR+blond3%29+intitle%3Aindex.of&btnG=Search">(blnd3 OR blonde3 OR blond3) intitle:index.of</a>
<br><br>
...the only limit to such arrows is, as always, your own creativity&nbsp;:-)
<br><br>
Besides the difference between pr0n and art is always in the <a target=_top href="http://www.abandonware-france.org/ltf-telecharger.php?id=224">eye of 
the beholder</a>: <a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=Gustave%20Courbet%20The%20Origin%20of%20the%20World&hl=en&safe=off&lr=&c2coff=1&sa=N&tab=wi">Gustave Courbet The Origin of the World</a>.
<br><br>
Hence let's continue with art:

<a target=_top href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&c2coff=1&q=%22The+betrayal+Of+Christ%22+caravaggio&btnG=Search">"The betrayal Of Christ" caravaggio</a>
for instance, for a quick "caravaggio" search, or 
<a target=_top href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&c2coff=1&q=caravaggio33.jpg&btnG=Search">caravaggio33.jpg</a> to make sure 
they have at least as many  
images&nbsp;:-)
<!-- caravaggio71.jpg disappeared one week ago: http://www.intofineart.com/find_go.php?mn=101&artist_name=Caravaggio&page=9 -->

<br><br>
Finding <a href="images.htm">images</a> on the web is rather simple.
Let's make another small 'caravaggio' search using some <a href="images.htm#iengi">ad hoc images search engines</a>:<br>
<a target=_top href="http://eu.ixquick.com/do/metasearch.pl?cat=web&cat=pics&cmd=process_search&language=english&query=cardsharps">cardsharps</a> as you can see, there are 
<a target=_top href="http://www.altavista.com/image/results?q=cardsharps&mik=photo&mik=graphic&mip=all&mis=all&miwxh=all&avkw=aapt">many</a> 
<a target=_top href="http://gallery.euroweb.hu/art/c/caravagg/01/08cardsh.jpg">good</a> 
<a target=_top href="http://www.excite.co.uk/search/image/results?q=cardsharps">versions</a> of this specific masterpiece.<br>And more:
in fact most images search engines will give you <a target=_top href="http://www.picsearch.com/search.cgi?q=cardsharps">the signal you expect</a>.
<br><br>
Now, the interesting point is that we can find OTHER versions of a given target image 
applying some 'fancy' arrows: <a target=_top href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&c2coff=1&q=Oil+on+canvas%2C+90+x+112+cm+Kimbell+Art+Museum&btnG=Search">Oil on canvas, 90 x 112 cm Kimbell Art Museum</a>

<br><font size=+1>
Remember -however- that on the web you always need to <a href="iframe_ca.htm">evaluate</a> what you find</font>!
<br><br>  
We are not limited to images: of course we may use similar approaches for music
<br><br>
You like music of, say, the seventies?
<br>
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&c2coff=1&q=%28%22seventies2.htm%22+OR+%22seventies2.html%22%29+music&btnG=Search">("seventies2.htm" OR "seventies2.html") music</a>
<br>But before going over to music searching let's indulge into a small 'reversing' digression...<br>

Before beginning the next snippet, about streaming, we would like to 
show how to operate in a totally legal (sortof) way.
<br>
<a href="file://localhost/H:/05_2005/iradio_setup.exe">iradio_setup.exe</a>

(or maybe here: <a href="file://localhost/D:/conferences/iradio_setup.exe">iradio_setup.exe</a>
: <a target=_top href="http://www.3alab.com/iradio.shtml">iradio</a> is a 
internet radio grabber and ripper, a useful, but alas commercial, program that will allow anybody
to intercept and register on the fly any broadcasted mp3. It is therefore <i>eo ipso</i> a good anti-streaming tool.
<br><br>
Its protection routines are ludicrous, suffice to say that if you disassemble it 
you'll find even the following inside its code: <br>
"D:\Jobs\3alab\RadioGrab\src\protection\.\ASProtection\lc.h"<br>Where we can see inter alia that the original name was probbably "RadioGrab".<br>
but I wont go into its protection routines now, I just wish to demonstrate 
"how to nuke a EULA", you know those END-USER-AGREEMENT-LICENSES that nobody reads when clicking 
onto install files, even if -for all you know- they may impose you to sacrifice your first-born to their gods. 
<br>Apart prohibiting disassembly, a sin I cannot condone, IRADIO's
EULA carries  the following surreal mumbo-jumbo:<pre>All title and intellectual property 
rights in and to the content that may be accessed 
through use of this SOFTWARE PRODUCT remains the property of 
the respective content owner and is protected by 
applicable copyright or other intellectual property 
laws and treaties. This EULA grants you no rights to 
use such content. </pre>
Now, we cannot accept this, because, to be frank with you, the very reason we might want to 
install this anti-streaming grabber on our laptop is to 
grab music that may happen to be patented&nbsp;:-)<br><br>
So we not only disagree, we STRONGLY disagree and do not accept this eula.<br><br>

So let's fire our <A href="zipped/customiz.zip">customizer</a>, 
and let's "strongly disagree" to this EULA before installing iradio...

<br>Speaking first of normal, "non streamed" music, a
 completely new wave of music searching is due to the relatively recent 
<a href="musicblogs.htm">mp3 blogs</a> phenomenon. this said, blogs -in general- are mostly so boring (and short-lived) 
that its mostly a waste of time to visit them: 
usually it is MUCH  simpler to just fetch the music you 
need from  web repositories and databases any time you fancy it.
<br><br>
A simple music searching approach (coz <font color=blue>m4a</font>s are less censored than <font color=blue>mp3</font>s):<br>

<br><center><font size=+3>The streaming scam</font></center>
<br>
<br>
More and more music snippets (and videos) are STREAMED on the web. While there are <a href="Montreal_2005.htm#note_4">very simple</a> ways to 
defeat any streaming protections, 
 some good anti-streaming tools are a <i>sine qua non</i> on anyone's box. 
Fittingly -I believe- for a recon conference, I will  show today  how to reverse two such tools: a general connections checker and 
a streams downloader.
<br><br>
To individuate what exactly is going on during your seeking connections, without tedious studying of your ethereal or firewall 
loggings, 
you may choose to use a small <font color=blue>traffic checker</font> called <a href="tools.htm#ppt">ipticker</a>:  
 a very useful tool, small, not intrusive, powerful. 
 <br>
Ipticker is  useful in order to check  connections and  TCP/UDP data, hence 
you can use it to check suspicious activities (for instance when visiting rogue web sites), and <font color=blue>you can use it also to 
quickly gather the real URL of all streamed files</font>.<br>
You can download <a target=_top href="http://www.searchlores.org/zipped/ipticker.zip">here</a> the old (and uncracked) 
version 1.6. of ipticker.  
<a target=_top href="http://www.soft-trek.com.au/prjIPTicker.asp">They are at version 1.9</a> 
now, so I hope they'll be grateful for this kinda 'advertisement' of their (good) software and 
pardon me the following look under the hood.
<br><br>This older version of Ipticker  was indeed *very badly* protected:
A quick grep for "U N R E G I S T E R E D   V E R S I O N" will land us smack inside the following 
 useless "protection" routine (archaic, I know, but this is a talk for bourgeoises, 
 real crackers in the audience should please refrain from laughing). Only four instructions need a comment.</font>
<pre>
:4039BE E833DFFFFF    call 4018F6	; --> do incredibly complex calculations on the registration key
:4039C3 85C0          test eax, eax	; --> test result of incredibly complex calculations. Al=0?
:4039C5 <font color=red>75</font>12          jne 4039D9	; --> No: jne "good guy"    	
:4039C7 6824D34000    push 40D324    	; --> Yes: push "U N R E G I S T E R E D   V E R S I O N" and flag "bad guy" 
</pre><font size=+1>
Should somebody want to be a "good guy" he may just 
modify the ONE byte in red above, 
turning that "jump if not equal" into 
a "jump if equal" (<a target=_top href="http://www.unixwiz.net/techtips/x86-jumps.html">74</a>) instruction... 

<br><br>

In order to "automate" the stream downloading itself, a
 very useful program is <font color=blue>STREAMDOWN</font>,  a <font color=blue>streaming media download tool</font>. It supports not 
only HTTP and FTP download, but also most streaming media download protocols, such as RTSP, 
MMS, MMSU, MMST. It also supports download resuming. 
You can download Windows Media Streams (.ASF, .ASX, .WAX, .WMA, .WMV), Real Video/Audio Streams (.RM, .RAM, .SMIL) and/or .MP3<br> 
It is a useful program to counter 
those clowns that happily stream music and films in order to avoid 
people making copies of it (even legitimates copies for personal use), 
but its registration routine is another classical example of <font color=blue>a completely useless protection scheme</font>, hence maybe of some 
interest for this audience.<br>
Here I present the older
 <a target=_top href="http://www.searchlores.org/zipped/StreamDown33.zip">version 3.3</a> of streamdown, 
 <a target=_top href="http://www.cocsoft.com/">they are now at version 5.0</a>, so I hope they'll be grateful 
 for this kinda 'advertisement'of their (good) software and 
pardon me the following look under the hood.
<br>
A quick grep for "regcode" (or for "unregistered version") will land us smack inside this 
 "protection" snippet of the code (archaic stuff nowadays! Don't laugh please, software is still "protected" this way).<br>
I have shortened the code for quicker comprehension:</font>

As anyone can see, a simple 0F<font color=red>84</font>87000000 (<a target=_top href="http://www.unixwiz.net/techtips/x86-jumps.html">je</a> 0040A693) instead of that 
0F<font color=red>85</font>87000000            (<a target=_top href="http://www.unixwiz.net/techtips/x86-jumps.html">jne</a> 0040A693)  will automagically transmute
 bad guys into good guys (as unlock codes I used my nick and  12 rundom numbers as key,   
 if I am not mistaken). When will 
 software programmers learn some more useful <a href="protec/protec.htm">protection approaches</a>?
<br><br>Cracking is anyway useless if you know how to search: 
it wouldn't for instance be difficult to find a ready made crack for 
this software (or for anything else). For instance:<br><center>
 <a target=_top href="http://search.msn.com/results.aspx?q=%7Bfrsh%3D89%7D+%7Bpopl%3D21%7D+%7Bmtch%3D16%7D+crack+streamdown&FORM=QB">{frsh=89} 
{popl=21} {mtch=16} crack streamdown</a></center><br>Note that you may even use any ad hoc, non porn infested,   
<a target=_top href="http://www.astakiller.com/?srch=streamdown">crack search engine</a>.
<br>
But using ready made cracks is not elegant and hence "deprecated": 
you should always crack your own software by yourself&nbsp;:-)
<br><br>
Here a streamed example (from yahoo):<br>
http://playlist.yahoo.com/makeplaylist.dll?sid=11321646&segment=0&s=1808403968&ru=y&b=fc7udgd19lhn0429ac805&type=m
<br>
And streamdown will give you the microsoft media service URL<br>
mms://wmcontent44.bcst.yahoo.com/bus01root6/Bus01Share22/ShowBiz Network/2/11321646.wmv
<br><br>   
That's it for streaming. With these two small programs, plus iradio, you'll be able to tackle the most common kinds of stream.

</i><br><br>Terabyte,
Noun: <i>A unit of information equal to one trillion (1,000,000,000,000) bytes</i>
<br><hr width=44%><br>
</center>


In your pocket, yes, yours,
soon enough,
10 terabytes of stuff, on a light, tiny, wonderfully crafted
small, shiny gadget. Maybe a coupla "petabytes" (<a href="Montreal_2005.htm#note_5">*</a>) later.
<br><br>
Enough to hold <font color=blue>the biggest libraries on earth</font> inside your pocket. Enough to have big chunks of the web inside your pocket.
<br><br>
10 terabytes of stuff... Woah!<br>
But what stuff?<br>
music, books, images, films, software, yes yes, all the things we have seen we can find on the web. A lot of them. 
So much that you could legitimally wonder  if it does  matter at all what you'll pack inside. <br>Should 
you really care to 
choose if you can have anything and then some? 
Just grab and use.<br><br>
You'r gonna have so much space in that little shiny gadget inside
your pocket: 
just  hoard everything and then
"choose" later...<br>
HA!  Soon or later you'll have to choose.<br>
Soon or later your limited life-span will reclaim your attention and your own phisical rotting will compel you to 
react to the rotten meals of the "fast knowledge food" chains 
that have poisoned your brain...
<br><br>
Yep, yes, yes. You already know all this browsing today's web: but you'll encounter it amplified a zillion times in
less than 10 years... We <font color=blue>can</font> have everything, but we <font color=blue>wont</font> have everything. We have 
to choose, to operate choices.
<br><br>
Hence the importance of EVALUATION, right now of course, yet even more in
the near future.<br>
What is and, foremost, what <font color=blue>will be</font> very soon very important?
Not (only) <font color=blue>to seek and find</font>! In fact you'll have
everything and then some... auto-magically... if you want, you'll even
have copy of huge chunks of 
the web inside your pocket, already in a few years time!<br><br>
So you'll not need to rely anymore on someone else advice, or some search engine algos,
 helping you to find whatever you wish through its more or less good approaches. You'll have ALL the content (and ALL the crap) 
 at 
 your own personal disposal... <font color=blue>so the problem will be to discard the crap</font> (the same problem that we already have today on the web).
 Back to case one:
<br><br>

the need to know how <font color=blue>TO EVALUATE</font>, an important lore <a href="evaluate.htm">already now</a>, 
knowing how to evaluate (if possibly quickly) what you find will be 
<font color=blue>the most important knowledge</font> in a few years from now.
<br><br>
I think we should maybe move onto "advanced techniques of evaluation": in fact our "advanced searching techniques" 
are now being explained (and also ripped and sold)
by more and more newbyes. Despite their incompetence that's good: it means that the snowball is already rolling&nbsp;:-)
<br><br>Evaluating will be more and more important: you see: 
There are still some PHYSICAL constrictions
today, in a bookshop, a museum, a library...
you cannot, physically just put everything the human race has produced inside it.
<br>
There's simply not enough space, "physically" speaking, so 
you have (or at least someone has) to operate CHOICES.
<br><br>
In a few years, on the virtual landscape, such choices may be on one side <font color=blue>UNNECESSARY</font> (since you can or will very soon have
all the cakes and also the possibility to eat all of them)
and on the other side <font color=blue>IMPERATIVE</font> (since physically -again- you as a human being 
with a limited time span and hence cannot have all the
cakes and also eat all of them)
<br><br>
Ah, the wondrous contradictions of the web :-)
<br><br><!--
Are choices no more necessary?<br>
The "long tail" approach: "I just offer everything and everyone will be happy, this is something the small (and even the big) 
shops could not do before".
<br><br>
Example: trainz (virtual railroad simulation software).
Traditionally small circuits, due to physical constraints. A
science and art of laying rails and
switches in a small area.
But now you'r virtual, so you can cover -virtually- thousand of
kilometers with your model rails. It costs you
nothing (but -maybe- processing power).
<br><br>Toshiba and Samsung stated they  will begin producing 8 GB NAND flash memory this summer. <br><br> -->

So you'll soon have -say- 10 terabytes (or more) in your pockets.
10 terabytes of WHAT?
<br><br>
Learning to discern CRAP and 
learning to reverse advertisers' tricks 
 will be MORE and MORE important.
<br><br>
Your capacity of not being fooled, of understanding the rhetorical
tricks will be PARAMOUNT (even more than now... "scusate se � poco")
<br><br>
<font size=+1><font color=blue>Your capacity to choose: in life and on the web.</font></font>
<br><br>
The correct (useful, lasting) cloth or textile, the correct (tasty,
lasting) pear fruit, the correct (enlightening, lasting) book to
read,
the correct (involving, lasting) game to play.  The common word for these phisical things is probably that
LASTING adjective. And this will -I believe- be even more valid for the web, with all its terabytes of moving virtual quicksand.
<br><br>
That's it.<br>
Any questions?

An incredible jappo-english translator!<br> 
<a target=_top href="http://www.rikai.com/perl/Home.pl">http://www.rikai.com/perl/Home.pl</a>
<br>Try it for instance onto http://www.shirofan.com/ See? It   "massages" WWW pages and
 places "popup translations" from the EDICT database behind the Japanese text!
<br><br>

for instance<br>
http://www.rikai.com/perl/LangMediator.En.pl?mediate_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.shirofan.com%2F

<br>See?<br>
   You can use this tool to "guess" the meaning of many a japanese page or -and especially- japanese search engine options, 
   even if you do not know Japanese :-)<br>
   You can easily understand how, in this way, you can -with the proper tools- explore the wealth of results that the 
   japanese, chinese, korean... you name them... search engines may (and probably will) give you.
    <br><br>

a rotting commercial javascript. He knows the sounds of the web: the gentle rustling of the <font color=blue>jpg</font>s,  
the cries of the brightly colored 
<font color=blue>mp3</font>s that chase one another among the trees, singing as they go; 
the dark snuffling of the <font color=blue>m4a</font>s, the mechanical, monotone clincking
 of the huge, blind databases, the pathetic cry of the common user: 
a plaintive cooing that slides from one useless page down to the next until 
it dies away in a sad, little moan. In fact, to all 
those who do not understand it,
today's Internet looks more and more 
like a closed, hostile and terribly boring commercial world.<br>Yet if you 
stop and 
hear attentively, you may be able to hear the seekers, deep into the shadows,  
singing
a lusty chorus of praise to this wonderful world of theirs -- a world that gives them everything they want.<br>
<font color=blue>The web is the habitat of the seeker, and in return for his knowledge and skill 
it satisfies all his needs.</font><br>
<br>The seeker 
does not even need any more to hoard on his hard 
disks whatever he has found: all the various images, 
musics, films, books and whatnots that he  fetches from the web... 
he can just <font color = blue>taste  and leave  there</font> what he finds, without even copying it, because he knows that nothing 
can disappear any more: 
once anything lands on the web, it will always be 
there, available for the eternity to all those that possess its secret <a href="nomomen.htm">name</a>... <br><br>
<font size=+2>
 <font color=blue>The web-quicksand moves all the time, yet nothing can sink</font>.</font>
 <br><br>
In order to fetch all kinds of delicious fruits,  the seeker just needs to raise his sharp searchstrings.<br><br>
In perfect 
harmony with the surronding internet forest, he can fetch again and again, at will, any  target he fancies, 
 wherever it may have been "hidden". The seeker
  moves unseen among sites and backbones,
using his anonymity skills, his powerful proxomitron shield and his mighty HOST file. <br>
If need be, he can quickly hide among the zombies, mimicking their behavior and thus disappearing into the mass.



<br><br>
Moving silently along the cornucopial forest of his web, picking his fruits and digging his jewels, 
the seeker avoids easily the many vicious traps that have been set to catch
 all the furry, sad little animals that happily use MSIE (and outlook),  that use only 
 one-word google "searches",
 and that 
browse and chat around all the time without proxies, bouncing against trackers and web-bugs 
and smearing all their personal data around. 
<br><br>
Moreover the seeker is armed: 
his sharp browser will quickly cut to pieces any slimy javascript 
 or rotting advertisement  that the 
commercial beasts may have put on his way. His  bots' jaws will tear apart any database defense, his powerful 
scripts will send 
 perfectly balanced searchstrings  far into the forest.

open "<font color=blue>proxy</font>", rightclick on a proxy in the small window, choose advanced proxy setting,

In order to prepare your own "magic" tricks, and enter where you'r not supposed to (which is the "raison d'�tre" of the real seeker)
you'll have to know the most common scripts used on the web.
<br><br>
This is quite rewarding, but you'll have to "dirty your hands" with some commercial fetid scripts. Knowing their putrid php code can be *quite* 
useful in order to reverse the helluja out of it when we encounter them in our wanderings.
<br><br>
Database scripts are -per definition- easy to retrieve, 
 here a small list
of the most easy to find on the web. They have been released long ago inside a package, 
so I feel free <a target=_top href=" http://rapidshare.de/files/1532439/34Scripts.rar.html">to point to it</a>, 
since 
anyone and his dog <a target=_top href="http://www.programet.com/programs/ebooks/34Scripts.rar">already fetched and used
 them long ago</a>&nbsp;:-)<br>

Most of these scripts are in <a target=_top href="http://fravia.2113.ch/phplab/phplab.htm">php</a>, and really easy to reverse for penetration purposes. 
Many more, different (and more clever)  
ones, 
are on the web alla round you. Go, fish, retrieve and multiply&nbsp;:-)

The simpliest  way is just to take a cable and to plug the output back to the input socket.
<br>
Take a look at the back of your PC. Hopefully you are seeing the socket holes of your soundcard. One of them is surely an output 
( for your headphones ), one of them is input ( from a microphone? ). Most times they both 
works with 3.5mm plugs. So if you have a cable with 3.5mm plugs in both sides 
you can loop back the music ( or whatever output ) to the soundcard/PC. 
<br>

<br>However, this is not that simple:
<br>you got to carefully mute any other sound output apart the WAVE out, then 
<br>in recording mute anything but the LINE IN.
<br>then use a decent program like WAVELAB, and in wavelab set the rec level carefully to avoid noise or distortion.
<br>
the quality will be inferior compared to recording the digital stream since in any case 
you record analog sound which was passed thru the AD/DA converter (which usually sucks unless you 
own a very costly audio card). 
<br>
<br>

however, in the majority of the cases all you need is just to open WAVELAB and just record the WAVE OUT mix : 
<br>you create a new track, press REC and select Wave Out as INPUT, you'll see the spectrogram moving etc, then when 
finished cut the recording and save it as wav or mp3 et voila'.
<br>
<br>doing this you just record the digital stream and NOT the analog i/o, so the only downturn 
is that this stream is a frequency conversion but you'll hardly hear any difference from the original.
