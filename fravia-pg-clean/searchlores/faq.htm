FIRST OF ALL: DON'T SEND OUT UNWANTED ATTACHMENTS</p>

<p>I don't like useless attachments (especially those coming from people 
using Micro$oft's bugged outlook) that aggravate my emailboxes: turn them off. If you
don't know how to turn them off, read the snippet <a href="faq.htm#attach">how to get rid of silly
attachments</a>. This 
is <font color="red">very important</font>, especially for newbies. </p>

<p>THEN PLEASE TAKE NOTICE OF THE FOLLOWING: 

<ul>
  <li>1. NO! I will not accept your sponsoring banners, "gate bindings" 
  or useless 
    links. Send me money -by all means- if you are a DONOR, but seek 
    other sites if you are a
    SPONSOR. I hate sponsors. My site will ALWAYS remain completely 
    advertisement
    free... see how many other important sites can you find on the web 
    that can proudly say
    the same, eheh&nbsp;:-) </li>
  <li>2. I do not, never did, and  never will, crack, hack or search anything for anybody: 
  learn how to search and find by yourself the solutions you believe you need. 
    I could not care less about the reasons you may list for not
    being able ~ not having the time ~ not having the luck ~ not having 
    the intelligence to
    crack/hack/search yourself your apps/servers/treasures. 
   </li>

  <li>3. I dislike Micro$oft because it's imposing a poor operating system to the world, using
    it's hidden (and bugged) features in order to bankrupt the concurrence. I hope that Bill
    Gates will soon die, or worse, pancaked by a truck, or something like 
    that. As a matter of fact I always hated
    everything commercial oriented. I would like to find a method to eliminate people
    that stupidly <b><u>watch</u></b> publicity ads on the Net (and elsewhere) and 
    I won't even
    tell you what I would like to do to the guys that <u><b>write</b></u> that 
    crap. On the other hand I
    like and help people that give out knowledge for free, like 
    
    my <font color=blue>[</font><a href="photos.htm">friend</a><font color=blue>]</font> <font color=blue>[</font><a href="http://www.stallman.org/">Richard Stallman</a><font color=blue>]</font>.</li>
<li> Once more: 
the solutions to your questions can most of the time be found 
through <u>searching</u>, so please  don't 
ask me for files, locations or 
database access exploits. Even if you 
are just an 
average lousy searcher you'll (and should) find them on your own in 10 minutes.
As a matter of fact, if you do not find what you were searching 
for after <font color=blue>15 minutes</font>, it only means that 
your search approach and/or strategy is <font color=blue>wrong</font>. 

</ul>

<Font sizde=+2>This older FAQ of mine could also answer some eventual questions</font><br>

<hr align="center">


<p align="left">COMMON QUESTIONS</font><br>
<br>
<b>Q:</b> Hey, may I link to your page? <br>
<b>A:</b> Please do. It's up to you. You do not need my authorisation. 
If you do link, then please
comment your links: links without comments are completely useless. <br>
<br>
<b>Q:</b> Hey, I put a link to you on my page. Now will you link to my page? <br>
<b>A:</b> NO! I may, eventually, if your page is outstanding, which I doubt. Yet I'm slow.
It may take ages. Don't count on that. Send me your URL a couple of times. Wait four to
six months and see what happens. <br>
<br>
<b>Q:</b> Why don't you put some kind of order in your messy site? <br>
<b>A:</b> My pages have to be understood. It's a maze on purpose.
 I don't want to make things much too easy for
lamers and 'me too' leechers. Yet there are various 'kinds' of orders you can apply. Find
them. Else forget it and learn <a href="index.htm">how to search</a><br>
<br>
<b>Q:</b> Hey, some of your links don't work! <br>
<b>A:</b> Yes, thanks. Will take some time... you see, running a site 
like mine is a
little like keeping those 'Chinese dishes' spinning on their poles... 
you keep running
from a section to the other trying to keep the momentum... fixing links is 
important, yet
it is NOT a priority. Send me a list of them. Wait some time. If I have not 
fixed them
please, by all means, send me the 404 once more. Yet don't forget that once 
having
learned 
<a href="index.htm">how to search</a> you will not need many links any more. <br>
<br>
<b>Q:</b> I like your page a lot! How can I make a cool site like yours? <br>
<b>A:</b> I don't know. No idea. I used the very good <a href="https://searchlores.nickifaulk.com/tools.htm&quot;">ultraedit</a> in windows when I started 
and 
am now using the excellent  
<a href="http://bluefish.openoffice.nl/index.html">Bluefish</a> in GNU-linux. 
And I started from scratch. <br>
A good idea is
to avoid frames, flash and similar crap, also never never use those 'frontpage' 
bloated things: always code your html pages yourself, per hand, and have just some -well chosen- images.
 Be warned, however: if 
you have gathered and, even more inportant: <font color="#00008B">if you 
can produce some content</fonT> 
your site will
florish by itself, else forget it and learn <a href="index.htm">how to 
search</a> first... you'll find more answers than you deserve.<br>
<br>
<b>Q:</b> Do you happen to have file/program so_and_so? I really really need it, because (insert sad story here).<br>
<b>A:</b> Unfortunately no, sorry. You may try to use a so called
"<a href="main.htm">search
engine</a>"<br>Else forget such needs until you learn <a href="index.htm">how to search</a><br>
<br>
<b>Q:</b> Where can I find file/program so_and_so? I really really need it, because (insert sad story here).<br>
<b>A:</b> No idea, sorry. You may try to use a so called
"<a href="main.htm">search
engine</a>"<br>Else forget such needs until you learn 
<a href="index.htm">how to search</a><br>

<br>
<b>Q:</b> I already (did read the faq / perused your site / made a lot of efforts / made
everything you told me to do). Can't you just tell me where to get file/program so_and_so? 
I really really need it, because (insert sad story here).
<br>
<b>A:</b> No idea, sorry. You may try to use a so called
"<a href="main.htm">search
engine</a>"<br>Else forget such needs until you learn how to search <br>
<br>

<b>Q:</b> How does IRC work? Where should I myself IRC? <br>
<b>A:</b> No idea, sorry. I do not IRC and consider it to be the absolute waste of time.
I even despise the very verb 'chatting'&nbsp;:-)
You may try to use a so called
"<a href="main.htm">search
engine</a>"  and search for
&quot;internet relay chat."<br>Else forget such puerile needs until you learn 
<a href="index.htm">how to search</a><br>
This said there is a small subsection of this site (by Kane) 
that deals with <a href="irc.htm">irc</a> searches.
<br>
<br>
<b>Q:</b> Hey! I sent you a very good essay a week ago and you still have not published
it! <br>
<b>A:</b> Sorry. Probably went lost, especially if you used Outlook, which is seriously
bugged. Try once more as PASTED TEXT in your email.<br> Also, please remeber
to use  <font color=blue>personalized subjects</font>! My filters will throw away emails with generic subjects like "I thought you were interested in..." or 
              "Re: Why did you not answer...", since such tricks are frequently used by the beasty spammers. 
              Always put 'personalized' terms like "searchlores" or "fravia" in your
              subjects.<br>

 Anyway wait (at least) a week and then resend PASTED. If it still
wont be published try once more later, or try elsewhere. I won't always 
reply to emails
if I don't deem it necessary, even if the information inside 
 has been useful. I am sorry, but I  do not have the
time to justify my publishing choices. Hope you'll not take it personally and you'll still
send (better) essays later on. If not, good luck to you anyway. <br>
<br>
<b>Q:</b> Hey! You published an essay of mine some time ago, thanksalot, yet I need to change
this and that, because I realised that (my lame searchstring crashes/I 
did not understand the stuff I was discussing at all/I did not check 
thoroughly my essay before
sending it to you)! <br>
<b>A:</b> You lazy scoundrel! Why didn't you check it better BEFORE? You 
deserve to wait
(and be blamed by all readers) for at least a couple 
of weeks... should this happen anew
I'll slowbomb you! <br>
<br>
<b>Q:</b> How can I learn to be a hacker? <br>
<b>A:</b> No idea, sorry. I'm no hacker, I'm not even very interested 
in hacking. You may try to use a so called
"<a href="http://s.teoma.com/search?q=how+to+become+a+hacker&qcat=1&qsrc=1&submit.x=14&submit.y=8">search
engine</a>"<br>Else forget such needs until you learn <a href="index.htm">how to search</a><br>
<br>
<b>Q:</b> How can I learn to be a cracker? <br>
<b>A:</b> Crack on your own old programs, ancient versions, obsolete dos stuff.
Reverse the COMPLETE code of a small program you don't have the source code of. 
Re-write it after having modified the code. Does it work as you wanted (and the 
original programmer would never have dreamed of)? 
Voila, you're a
cracker. If you really need help in order to CHOOSE what to read, 
<a href="http://www.angelfire.com/ca/mammon/" target="_blank">+Mammon_'s site</a> is a magical
place that will send you on the most correct path. Yet, even once 
you have learned how to
reverse alien code, don't believe you KNOW anything: 
Zen cracking is a completely
different matter. You'll probably never understand it, "geschweige denn" 
learn 
it. <br>
<br>
<b>Q:</b> How can I learn to protect better my apps? <br>
<b>A:</b> Please read and study the <a href="protec/protec.htm">ad hoc material</a> on my site: you
won't ask this again. Should you feel you need to ask this again, you will NEVER learn how
to be a good protector, I'm afraid... forget it, there are many
 other <a href="http://www.woodmann.com/fravia/images/spicy.jpg">interesting things</a> on the web. <br>
<br>
<b>Q:</b> Hey, I'm using MSIE to browse your site and &quot;<b>Kaa-Bum</b>!&quot; I get (total
destruction/funny colours/bubbles/Delhi belly/whatever) when I access some of your
pages... what should I do? <br>
<b>A:</b> My pages have been prepared ONLY for Opera browsers. Besides, M$IE it's slower
AND sloppier AND even more bugged than any other browser! 
There are some pages of mine that
have been expressely MADE in order to explode your M$IE browser, just for the fun of it (I am not politically correct, hehe&nbsp;:-)<br>
Enough reasons for a straight honest answer to all your problems: download and 
use (and
modify and 'panzer') your own copy of <a
HREF="http://channels.netscape.com/ns/browsers/download.jsp">Netscape</a>'s
Navigator, or, even better, your own copy of the very agile (few 
 million bytes)
and much more useful <a HREF="http://www.operasoftware.com/">Opera</a> browser! <br>
<br>
<b>Q:</b> Hey, please! I need some site passwords! You'r a site buster, 
can't you
please... <br>
<b>A:</b> Beggar off. <br>
<br>
<b>Q:</b> Please, I'm desperate! I'm not a bad person, and I really need you to
(hack/crack/revenge me/fetch a password) inside (my school server/someone's
webpage/someone's server/someone really bad and nasty) because (insert sob story here).
HELP ME PLEASE!!! <br>
<b>A:</b> Beggar off, you stupid sod. <br>
<br>
<b>Q:</b> Hey, you gotta a lot of hits! You know: you could make a lot of money out of
them! You could for instance (accept us as sponsors/work for us/publish 
this ad/enter this
webring/set our 'password only' commercial entry area...) <br>
<b>A:</b> Beggar off. I'm not interested in any job you could offer me, 
unless you'll pay
me (and very well) in order to do what I'm doing now and whatever I'll 
fancy for the
future: <b>Donors</b> are always welcome, sponsors ARE NOT: I'm not 
going to carry ANY
awful &quot;sponsorship&quot; banner, nor ANY advertising ads 
on my pages, NEVER. I'm not to be bought for ANY sum whatsoever, 
believe it or not.
Therefore STOP sending me ridiculous spamming offers! Money 
does not mean anything to
me... try with inside information instead... :-) <br>
<br>
<b>Q:</b> Hey, your site is huge, and the telephon bills are huge as well... couldn't you
please let me find and/or send me all your pages zipped, so that I can peruse them at leisure? <br>
<b>A:</b> This kind of questions make me sad. How long will I have to tell you, kids, that
you should <b>FIRST LEARN <a href="index.htm">HOW TO SEARCH</a> THE NET</b>! 
If you had
done it, you would know how to fetch a whole complete site <u>for free</u> 
using either
special software like <u>websnake</u> or <u>teleport pro</u>, or a 
wwfetcher (or any good
agora server) or even a dedicated script made by yourself. 
I suggest you to consult my site on-line,
because many pages of mine are continuously updated or modified 
without notice and also
because you surely waste so much time already on useless sites 
on the web that you should
for once peruse at leasure when you find some worthy information... 
<br>
<br>
<b>Q:</b> Listen, Since you publish all those nice essays, you must have the 
addresses of
all those good reverses and seekers. Although I never contacted you 
before, I'm a very nice
guy and I need the addresses of X, Y, Z! Could you please, 
since (insert sob story here),
put me in contact with them? <br>
<b>A:</b> Unfortunately no. I lost all those addresses inside a Blowfish&nbsp;:-). 
If you are
serious about recruiting people for this kind of jobs (which I doubt) 
you should at the
very least know how to contact them directly even if you do 
not have their addresses. </p>

Now, if you still really need something, or if you want to thank for the
efforts I have put in these pages, you may <a href="info.htm#write">contact 
me</a>.

<h2 align="center">Get rid of useless attachments</h2>

<p align="center">(original by Ben Goetter &amp; 
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=opera&rls=en&q=%22Gerald+E.+Boyd%22&sourceid=opera&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8">Gerald Boyd</a>) </p>

<pre>
I will start to filter all the mail addressed to me that contain
HTML coding, MIME encoding, and unwanted Micro$oft attachments 
such as WINMAIL.DAT.

I getting deluged with this junk. Will you newbies please, please,
please, turn off this &quot;stuff&quot;.

M$-Mail has a feature that allows M$-Mail users to exchange
fully-formatted messages (fonts, italics, etc.), by attaching an RTF
(Rich Text Format) file to the message.  Another M$-Mail user will see
the formatted version, while any other email program will show the ASCII
message plus the attachment.  M$ made this option enabled by default, so
many M$-Mail users have no idea that they are annoying the rest of the 
world.

When Exchange thinks that it is sending mail to another Exchange user on 
the Internet, Exchange (more properly, the Internet Mail message service 
provider) encodes the message, along with attached files, embedded OLE 
objects, and their associated icons, into a special data block called the 
TNEF (pronounced tee-neff) block. This block encapsulates the complete 
original content of the Exchange message, so that the message arrives at 
its destination with all proper formatting intact, including boldface, 
underlining, fonts, and colors. Otherwise, Exchange formats the message 
in an Internet-standard fashion, discarding all rich text attributes and 
ensuring that all attached files appear as standard attachments. 

The problem arises when people not using Exchange or Outlook receive a 
message in the TNEF format: instead of seeing a formatted message, they 
see a big chunk of UUENCODE data if the sender used UUENCODE format, or 
a MIME body part application/ms-tnef if the sender used MIME. Depending 
on which mail program they use, they may either see a long sequence of 
hexadecimal digits, or they may see an attached binary file named 
WINMAIL.DAT. 

Here's how to turn it off:
Step #1:
. Double-click on the Mail and Fax icon in Control Panel.
. Click on the Services tab, and select Internet Mail from the list. If
Internet Mail is not listed, click Add - add this service.
. Click Properties, and then Message Format.
 Turn off the option that reads Use MIME when sending messages.
. Click OK and then OK again.

Step #2:
. Double-click on the name of each recipient in your Address Book.
. Turn off the option that reads Always send to this recipient in
Micro$oft rich-text format.
. This option needs to be set for each recipient of a message - if even
one has this turned on, all recipients will still get the attachment.

Note: Either of these methods should work for most users, but sometimes
nothing seems to work - yet another brilliant design strategy by M$.  I
you plan to be sending lots of internet email, you should seriously
consider using a mail program more suited to the task, such as Pegasus
or Eudora.

Note: A bug in Exchange may cause line feeds to be replaced with equal
signs when rich-text mail is disabled.

If other people complain that your messages arrive with gibberish or a
mysterious WINMAIL.DAT file, then try Rich-Text Sentry.

Rich Text Sentry will not work with M$ Office 95 WordMail,
since the WordMail forms don't support client extensibility. For
the same reason, it will not work with the simplified send note
included in the Windows 95 Messaging Update.

To get rid of MIME encoding:
Check your E-mail program and:
Change from:
Content-type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
Content-transfer-encoding: quoted-printable

Change to:
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Turning HTML off in Outlook Express -- Windows 95.
Go to Tools and then click on Options ...
Go to Edit and then click on Preferences ...
Click on Send and choose Plain Text in Mail sending format.
Do not forget to unmark &quot;Reply to messages using the format 
in which they were sent.&quot;

Turning HTML off in Netscape 4.0
This configuration is the same on all platforms: Mac, Win95, Win3.xx,
Linux, ...
Go to Edit and then click on Preferences ...
Click on the plus before mail and groups and click on 'Messages'. Turn
'By default, sent HTML messages' off.
Go to 'More Options' and choose 'Always convert the message into plain
text'.
Click on OK and on OK again.

Let's hope you will not send out any more attached crap...</pre>
