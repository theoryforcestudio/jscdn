<bR><font size=+1>
    The importance of your 'topic' should not be underestimated, especially in the 
preparation phase of your search. In fact you should first of all decide if your 
topic is likely to be addressses on the Internet at all. There are more easy to find 
resources for 
computers and natural sciences than for humanities and social sciences, for instance. 
Also the information posted on the web is often NOT updated, and once you have found your 
quarry, you'll often have to check if there is an updated copy around (very important, 
but very often forgotten). Your topic will also influence your
search approach choices (search engines vis-�-vis combing and luring, for instance), and, 
if you decide to start your query with a search engine 
you'll have also to choose <u>which</u>
 search engine(s) you will use according to your topic (a good rule of thumb, 
if you cannot 
remember which specific engine should be used for which search, is 
to repeat the same search AT LEAST 
on Altavista, Fast and Google). Anyway the following  'topic' part is actually 
dedicated to the preparational 'linguistic' work you should make BEFORE shooting 
your first querystring, <SPAN STYLE="color: black; background: yellow">in order 
to prepare that very querystring</span>.</fonT></i></center>
<hR width=44%><font size=+1>
         Your ability to find the information you seek on the 
Internet is a function of how precise your queries are and how 
effectively you use a plethora of search services. Poor queries return poor 
results; good queries return good results. Contrary to the hype 
surrounding "intelligent agents" and "artificial intelligence," 
the fact remains that search results are only as good as the query 
you pose, which will decide a lot about how you will be able to 
'feel' your search. There is no magical solution, but there are some useful 
tools, and the best one is a pencil with a sheet of white paper.<bR>
 Internet searchers (perhaps you too) 
that use only a couple of words in a query finish to 
spend endless hours perusing useless documents 
that do not contain any of the fishes they were looking for.<bR>
There are, however, some effective ways to structure your queries,  
using boolean and other operators to target the quarry you seek, these parameters 
are explained elsewhere 
on this site. Absent these 
techniques the common lore is that you will usually give up in 
frustration after having reviewed without results long lists of 
documents... yet searching is also an art...<br>The following needs some 'feeling', 
but can be quite effective: at times a simple "broad" search, for instance on 
altavista  "simple" query form, where you just add a long series of query-related 
terms, can deliver incredibly accurate results. In order to decide which are 
the best query-related terms my 'topic tablet' could be -I believe- of some help.
<br><br>
<SPAN STYLE="color: black; background: yellow">Use of the topic tablet</span>: 
You should try to fill ALL fields - if applicable - since 
the more 'specifity' you obtain BEFORE starting your query, the more relevant results you'll 
get from the beginning.<bR>Note that the best FIRST 
use of the collected data is -for once- 
NOT on the advanced altavista search form, but on the 
SIMPLE altavista search form, 
where you'll just impose the FIRST term of the query, 
and leave all other terms free to 
float, separating them with commas (see the two first examples). 
Once you'll have identified the 'signal' among the noise you'll be able to 
cut more effectively through the boolean and time restraints on the advanced form.
<bR> 
Have a look at the example I have prepared to understand its working and then print the muster (for your future use). 
Your PC, a sheet of paper (with the tablet on it), a pencil... and you'r set to 
go and find! <br>
