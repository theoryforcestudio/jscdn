<font size=+1>In matters of "copyright" (but as the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">Free Software Foundation</a> points out, 
we should rather speak of imposed PATENTS, not of alleged "rights", nor of <a href="http://deoxy.org/ipmyths.htm">mythical</a> "intellectual property"), 
the powers that be have long ago started a ruthless battle against each one of us.<br>So I thought that we might as well fight back&nbsp;:-)

<br><br>
 Multinationals' only concern is to maximise their "intellectual property" privileges around the world. 
 Co-ordinated, continuous pressure from  mighty 
 corporations – mainly pharmaceutical giants – have succeeded (through their political lackeys) in making "rights and patents" issues a core priority 
 of the global trade policy.
 <br><br>
<b>YET</b> the current and "global" GATT copyright laws *MUST BE* based on the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/treaties/berne/overview.html">Berne convention</a>, 
at least since 1988, following the 
signature of the TRIPS  (Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) <a href="http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/trips_e/t_agm0_e.htm">agreement</a>: 
 "<font color=blue>"With respect to copyright, parties are required to 
 comply with the substantive provisions of the Berne Convention for the protection of literary and artistic works"</font>", that was
added to the "Marrakesh Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organisation", and was signed in Morocco on 15th April 1994.
<br><br>
Berne offered protection lasting <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/treaties/berne/7.html">until 50 years after an author’s death</a>.  
With the TRIPS agreement, the length of this term  
was extended  (in order to harmonize all EU-laws with Germany) to the life of the author plus 70 years. And that's it! After 70 years 
it's back to mama public domain&nbsp;:-)

<center><font color=blue size=+2>Fighting back</font></center>
<br><br>
In order to fight back, as usual, our first task is to "reverse" the situation: ok, we hate patents... we find that 
intellectual patents are inherently evil. But -alas- patents HAVE been imposed by the powers that be. So what can we do? (<font color=blue>Legally</font>, I mean, 
because <font color=blue>illegally</font> everyone and his dog is already doing his outmost: software protections' cracking, 
anonymous mass-uploading of copyrighted material, 
peer to peer & torrent mass-downloading like there were no tomorrow)... What can we do legally?<br>
A lot: first of all a patent, while evil, does assure
that after the appointed length of time, inventions and "intellectual products" do become open to the
public for all time. Henceforth <font color=blue>they are NOT PATENTBAR any more</font>: once back in the public domain (which is
<i>eo ipso</i> a domain in which contents are free from
intellectual property rights), any masterpiece of thought will
 never 
be appropriated again under any intellectual property law&nbsp;:-)<br>
Methinks that's quite an important point.
<br><br>
This means that if we ignore (as we easily can&nbsp;:-) all actual, modern, "patented" intellectual properties, we can have
at the same time all 
the modern free non patented ones AND the older masterpieces that went back in the public domain after 70 years.<br>
For the first case, <u>modern patents</u>, not being able to use them 
for free  can be often enough a typical case of "<font color=blue>good riddance</font>": the free alternatives 
may be (and mostly are) waaay better, and this is not only true for pharmaceutical products...  
For  software, for instance, see our <a href="bangla.htm">free unpatented sotware collections</a> and all  
the LGPL (<a href="http://sourceforge.net/softwaremap/trove_list.php?form_cat=16">GNU Library or Lesser General Public License</a>) applications. <br>
For the second case, <u>older masterpieces</u>, see below: basically the 
fact that we, the public, (owners of the public domain) are *millions* on the web, while the corporations and all assorted 
patent defenders (owners of the patents) are but a bunch of well-paid clowns, means that *we* can row with force against the foetid 
commercial morasses and sail  the whole web back into our clear sea of share currents.
<br><br>
 Everyone can give his own valuable contribution. Choose a target you know well: if you are -say- a musicist take, for instance, 
 the complete 6th symphony of Mahler. <u>Complete</u>: scores, music in mp3 or ogg format, explanations, history, discography, everything! 
 <br>Prepare and upload your own contribution on the web!<br>Gustav Mahler, our example, died in 1911,and 1911+70 means 
 that the copyrights for his music and work <b>ended</b> more than 20 years ago: in 1981. 
 <br>You can and should publish something yourself: chose a subject you love and know 
 and become a  "legal Pirate"! Scanners cost nothing nowadays, and you already <a href="basic.htm">know how to search</a>&nbsp;:-) Welcome on board!
 <br><br>
 Oh, yes, some people  wont like it. Not a all. Check first if the subject you have in mind is already on the web or not. 
 In many cases it will be, but chances are that somebody will be 'selling' it. People are supposed to pay even 
 for the <i>res publicae</i> nowadays&nbsp;:-(
 <br><br>
 This will also -if well made- assure you qvasi-immortality: let's say you are a young american: your 
 useless web-blog will last a couple of years at most, while, instead, your web-edition of  
 -say- "In dubious battle" by John Steinbeck (copyright 1936... 1936+70=2006&nbsp;:-) will be used by people all over the world 
 for free during the next 200  (or 2000?) years&nbsp;:-)
 <br><br>
 I have decided to present an example myself, and to give <font color=blue>my own</font> lasting contribution to the web:  which  consists, 
fittingly with my <a
href="http://www.searchlores.org/whoiam.htm">past studies</a>,
in the accurate scanning of some great early medieval
sources. I have decided, to begin
with,  to spread into the deep Web the complete collated  version of the <a href="ORIGOGENTISLANGOBARDORUMWAITZ.htm">Origo Gentis 
Langobardorum</a>, that I have 
 scanned from Georg Waitz's authoritative edition, in MGH
(Monumenta Germaniae Historica)
 SSrrLang (Scriptores rerum Langobardicarum et Italicarum saec.
VI-IX), Hannover 1878. This text was not available on the web  together with its fundamental footnotes and variants (until now).

 <br><br>
Admittedly most of the examples I have made above are about 'classics'. But there are some good reasons for that.<br>

Have you ever wondered <font color=blue>WHY</font> activities like reading poetry, or hearing classics, or 
studying for years philosophical masterpieces, are not 'pushed' in today's world? Why do our societies, instead,
 <a href="http://odin.dep.no/bfd/engelsk/publ/handbooks/004061-990036/dok-bn.html">push kids and teens</a> to continued
consume, whipping them with "trends" and "modes"? Why should they be interested more in the most 
ephemerical aspects of life than in the "aeternal" ones? 
Because -simplistically put- there's not really much money you can make out of poetry and philosophy, nor from things that would last for the eternity.
<br><br>
Almost every conceveible human activity has been transformed in a <a href="realicra/slaves.htm">guinea-pig stable for forced consumerism</a>, whipped 
along
 through <a href="antiadve.htm">heavy advertisement</a> strokes.<br>
You used to take a bike, any bike would do, in order to move around your town, gratis and quickly. 
Now you are supposed first of all to "dress" like 
"a biker", and secondly to use "special alloys", "advanced gears" and whatsnot in order to SPEND money. Samo samo 
with -say- mountain trekking and with any other 'sport' activity. All of them have been transformed into huge traps for consumerism junkies.

<br><br>
Things wont change on the short term. They may even get <a href="opr0207B.htm">worse</a>, so excuse my rant. But I still 
 hope that Joe Doe will now publish on the Web my Steinbeck,
and that Franz Schmidt will publish -say- Schopenhauer's "Parerga und Paralipomena", Frankfurt am Main 1850,
and  Paul Dupont will publish -say- Jules Verne's "L'île mystérieuse"... Oops, he already <a href="http://jv.gilead.org.il/gallica/ilemyst/1/">did!</a> (and in 
<a href="http://jv.gilead.org.il/kravitz/">english</a> as well&nbsp;:-)
<br>The Web is a 22 billion sites huge library, collection of images, repository of software, 
music, newspapers and books, <font color=blue>OUR LIBRARY</font> whose powerful 
muscles may still flex under the commercial fat...  
let's have everything that should be in the pulic domain REALLY where it belongs!
<br><br>
And you know something? It's not really necessary to state all the above. Many people 
 have been already doing exactly this, all the time, by themselves, I'm just a late comer, a legal pirate myself,
  proudly joining them right now.
<br><br>
Ho ho! And a bottle of legal Rum!
