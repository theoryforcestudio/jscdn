        <i>This series of small "searching snippets"  plays with the old (rhetorical) 
seven simple Latin questions, which made it possible to describe any event: 
 "quis, quid, ubi, quibus auxiliis, cur, quomodo, quando". I have chosen this approach 
in order to (try to) show some 
possibly useful paths when 'solving'  common  web-queries. The idea is 
to demonstrate at the same time some useful searching approaches, that can be used 
for all related queries, and highlight some frequent "web-pitfalls", that seekers 
should learn to identify and avoid. The material presented here  is still <u>in fieri</u>, 
has been collected & 
prepared for my London workshop, which will be held on 28 february 2003, and 
is intended to be presented on a beamer with a quick web-connection. Suggestions, criticism and 
improvement proposals are welcome.

  "<font color=blue>Natural Language Searching</font>"   was all the rage a couple of years 
ago (nowadays "all the rage" is again "Inferring web communities from link topology"&nbsp;:-) 
<br><br>That 'natural language' has nothing to do with "your" cokney, mind you...  
we are anyway here too far south to be in hearing distance of the bells 
of St. Mary Le Bow&nbsp;:-) And yet, like cockney, rephrasing a question so 
that it can be turned into a useful web-search requires some ingenuity.
<br><br>
As seekers  know well, all '<a href="http://www.ask.com/">ask jeeves</a>' and similar search 
engines, that blossomed in those years,  
tried to "phrase web searches in the form of questions", a target deemed worthy 
partly because most users 
were (and are) 
 simply too dumb to be able to 
use a correct syntax when querying (<i>"boolean bombs"</i>), and partly 
because simplification for the end-user 
is indeed --most of the time-- a correct and worthy 
path to follow. 
<br><br><a href="http://www.ask.com/">Ask jeeves</a> was
one of the first significant deployments of natural language technology on the Internet (note that the 
very good <a target=_top HREF="http://www.teoma.com/">TEOMA</a> search engines is a development 
of ask jeeves).<br>
It tried to give users the ability to question their search engines in normal English.<br> 
Here follow some specific query examples that we will examine in-depth, since 
     "Learning to transform questions into effective queries" is of the outmost importance 
for "real", human seekers as well, 
and since I believe these small, practice-oriented, examples may 
shed a little light on some effective searching techniques for all those, like you, that are not (yet) 
in the know.<br>  


<br>
    As you will see, we are still FAR away from a "natural language searching" good algorithm... 
ask jeeves just pumps a ready-made database  of responses for a couple of millions 
of the most 
commonly-asked questions.
<br>In this specific engine, moreover, the real algos for transforming on the fly a real NEW "natural language 
question" into a correct set of responses are either <u>very</u> weak or, more probably,
next to inexistent.<br>
We'r gonna give them some pointers to develop those algos in a correct way&nbsp;:-)

 <a name="the questions"></a>  <br><br>

<table border=1 width=88%><tr><td bgcolor="#C6E7C6"><center><font
size=+3>Joe A. User's 7 questions</font>&nbsp;</center></td></tr></table>
</center>

<br>I collected the following queries on the morning of 
5 february 2003, taking them at random from <a href="http://www.ask.com/docs/peek/">Jeeves' peek</a>, 
where you can see what people are searching for on jeeves <i>eo ipso</i>  
(many  similar services are listed 
on the <a href="../pepldoin.htm">ad hoc section</a> of my sites).<br>Here we go with 
 7 questions (by "Joe A. User", where the A stays for 'average') 
that will allow me to show you, to-day, 
some searching approaches --and caveats-- you may not be aware of.<br>
<br><center>
<table border=1><tr><td colspan=3><center><font size=+2>Joe A. User's 7 questions</font></td></tr>
<tr><td>
<a href="lea2tra.htm#flag_finding">Where can I find the flag of the country Ireland</a>?</td>

</center>
<br>
As you can see, all these questions have been presented in normal, plain English.
Now let's have a look at the answers given by "ask jeeves", at the answers 
you should be able to find quickly, and at 
the possible approaches to find SIMILAR answers on the web. 
Let us see also wether  the algorithms used by the various search engines 
are good enough as they are, are miserable, could be improved, 
should be ditched, or whatever.<br>   

<!-- how to find a flag begin -->
<a name="flag_finding"></a> <br><br> 
<center>
<table border=1 width=88%><tr><td bgcolor="#C6E7C6"><center><font
size=+3>Where can I find the flag of the country Ireland?</font><br>
<font color=red>ubi</font> ~  the real meaning of a query</center></td></tr></table>
</center>
<br><br>
        
Now I really do not know what this Joe User guy means with this question. And I guess no search engine's 
algo will be able to 
tell us that either.<br>
<br><table border=1><tr><td><center><font color=blue>What is the real meaning behind a given query?</font>
</center></td></tr></table>
<br>   
There are a couple of possibilities, though: 
<br><font color=blue>1</font>. He wants just to find 
a picture of the Irish flag, just to see what it looks like;
<br><font color=blue>2</font>. He wants to find it and know its exact colours IN ORDER TO 
reproduce them (on the web or elsewhere);<br>
<font color=blue>3</font>. He wants to know the history of the Irish national flag, and maybe 
also of all 
possible other (minor) irish flags, 
the more accurate and verbose 
info on this stuff and topic, the better for him.
<br><hr width=55% align=left><br>  1) &nbsp;&nbsp; In the <font color=blue>first case</font>: 
A seeker would probably already know what the Irish flag 
looks like, duh. If not he would just quickly use <a href="http://images.google.com/images?&q=flag+of+ireland">google</a> 

or       <a href="http://www.alltheweb.com/search?advanced=1&cat=img&q=flag+of+ireland">fast</a> 
image searches and that's it.<br><hr width=33% align=left>
  2) &nbsp;&nbsp;   In the <font color=blue>second case</font> we would need to find out the <a href="http://www.gov.ie/taoiseach/publication/">irish 
flag 
pantone colours</a> (for green <font color=blue>347</font>, and for orange <font color=blue>151</font>) 
or go for a <a href="http://www.alltheweb.com/search?cat=web&cs=iso-8859-1&advanced=1&type=all&q=%22irish+flag%22+pantone">"irish flag" pantone</a> 
search, and then we would probably like to have 
 the best approximation, for web usage purposes, 
with the pertinent "browser safe" RGB codes. 
Note that the following info can be helpful for students of an university  College of 
"Design and Communication" as well&nbsp;:-) <pre>PMS 347 RGB:0-153-102 (#<font color=blue>009966</font>)
PMS 151 RGB:255-102-0 (#<font color=blue>FF6600</font>)</pre>
<table border=0><tr><td> let's see... </td><td><table border=1><tr><td bgcolor="#009966">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td bgcolor="#FF6600">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td></tr></table></td><td> ...not bad, 
but the orange is not really 
convincing. </td></tr></table>  
Let's try a better orange with a <a href="http://www.autoscripter.com/col/pantone/pantone.html">pantone 
to html</a> converter (forgetting for the time being the 'browser safe' colors on the ranges 00/33/66/99 and 
so on): in this case Pantone 151 gives a more accurate
<font color=blue>FF6308</font>.
 <table border=0><tr><td> let's see... </td><td>
<table border=1><tr><td bgcolor="#009966">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td bgcolor="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td bgcolor="#FF6308">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td></tr></table></td>
<td> ...not bad either, and 
this orange looks (slightly) more 'Irish' to me... </td></tr></table>
<br>
In CMYK values this would be:<pre>Green C 100 - M 0 - Y 80 - K 10
Orange C 0 - M 40 - Y 90 - K 0</pre>
<br><br>


  <hr width=33% align=left>
 3) &nbsp;&nbsp;  For <font color=blue>the third case</font>, 
now, <font color=blue>good seekers</font> should know, or quickly find out (which is the same), 
that 

 the best places to find info on a flag would be 
either a specific site, found <a href="../ideale1.htm">combing</a>, like
<a href="http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Sparta/1648/">http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Sparta/1648/</a>, 
 (where you'll see that you could search also 
for "<font color=blue>bhratach na hÉireann</font>", the gaelic 
translation of "flag of Ireland", 
on some local, specific engine... of course 
being aware of the relative rarity of gaelic pages on the web&nbsp;:-)
<br>
More simply, we could poke inside 
well known 'flag' places,
 like  the <a href="http://www.flags.net/IREL.htm">world flags database</a>, 
or
<a href="http://flagspot.net/flags/ie.html">flags of 
the world</a>.  Of course in order to get the necessary angles you could 
use a more simple approach kinda 
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=ISO-8859-1&as_qdr=all&q=%22history+of+the+irish+flag%22&btnG=Google+Search">"history of the irish flag"</a>,  
or, maybe better a query that is almost "the opposite" of Joe's natural language one: 
<a href="http://www.alltheweb.com/search?advanced=1&cat=web&cs=iso-8859-1&type=all&q=irish+tricolour+colours+green+orange+history&jsact=&l=pref&ics=iso-8859-1&cs=iso-8859-1&wf%5Bn%5D=3&wf%5B0%5D%5Br%5D=%2B&wf%5B0%5D%5Bq%5D=&wf%5B0%5D%5Bw%5D=&wf%5B1%5D%5Br%5D=-&wf%5B1%5D%5Bq%5D=buy&wf%5B1%5D%5Bw%5D=&wf%5B2%5D%5Br%5D=-&wf%5B2%5D%5Bq%5D=com&wf%5B2%5D%5Bw%5D=url.all%3A&embed%5Bswf%5D=x&embed%5Brvp%5D=x&dincl=&dexcl=&geo=&limip=&doctype=&dfr%5Bd%5D=1&dfr%5Bm%5D=1&dfr%5By%5D=1980&dto%5Bd%5D=8&dto%5Bm%5D=2&dto%5By%5D=2003&size%5Bp%5D=%3D&size%5Bv%5D=&size%5Bx%5D=0&depth%5Bp%5D=%3E&depth%5Bv%5D=&hits=10&nooc=off">irish tricolour colours green orange history</a>
(note that this query also eliminates all the "com" sites URLs 
and all sites where the word "buy" appears somewhere in the text). 
<br><br>
But there is no need to use a given search engine or a specific queryformat for 
this specific topic in fact wherever you search, however you formulate, 
you'll be on a roll with this flag: 
it's clear from the beginning that this search will give 
good results: the irish, 
being a quite nationalistic folk for obvious historical reasons,  have spread 
info on their flag <a href="http://www.netcraft.com/?restriction=site+contains&host=ireland&lookup=Netcraft%21&position=limited">all over the 
web</a>: see? More than one thousand SITES (not pages, eh) with the word <font color=blue>ireland</font>, 
and more than 1000 other sites with the word <a href="http://www.netcraft.com/?restriction=site+contains&host=irish&lookup=Lookup%21&position=limited">irish</a> 
on the deep deep web!<br>
And take note of this last "netcraft search approach", because it could prove 
quite useful for other 
specific searches&nbsp;:-)<br><br>
So Joe user could have even tried to <a href="../magicfi.htm">guess</a> his 
target: <a href="http://www.irishflags.com/">http://www.irishflags.com/</a> and got 
some results... but that's a "<font color=blue>com</font>" site, brrr, we better close it right now&nbsp;:-)
   
<br><br> <u><font size=+2>"Ask Jeeves" own answers:</font></u>
<br><br><a href="http://www.ask.com/main/askjeeves.asp?ask=Where+can+I+find+the+flag+of+the+country+Ireland%3F&o=0&x=20&y=11">Here they are</a>, 

unfortunately, as you can see, ask jeeves, like many other engines, 
still believes in the commercial nonsense, and will therefore deceive his unlucky 
users 
pushing up 
in the first  positions links that are absolutely useless 
("Virtually all country flags in stock", "for home and business"). <br>
        This commercial spamming -as we will see- is here and elsewhere 
a fact, which will unfortunately prove to be 
globally true for ALL answers to the 7 questions listed above, 
so we wont need to repeat this warning too often, hopefully&nbsp;:-)
<br><br>
If the users manage 
to 
spring down to the real answers, which are buried beneath the commercial crap,  
"ask jeeves" will still give on its first  positions crappy links like the

"CIA World Factbook 2002 -- Ireland"  (with flag indeed, but very poor and lacklustre 
information), some 
commercial crap stickers, a site for an anti-racism campaign, infoplease's "countries of 
the world", the CIA again (this time United Kingdom), "workers solidarity in Ireland" 
and what not.
<br>Clearly, even if --maybe-- useful in order to find some elementary notions about the 
Irish flag, this ask jeeves approach would (and should) 
not satisfy our average "joe User".

<font color=red>cur</font> ~ knowing how to rephrase</center></td></tr></table>
</center>
<br><br>
               You might think this is a stupid question. 
 However, as you will see, human kind is actually still debating this point, 
and a Russian (or a Japanese) would counter 
you that the very question is bogus, since the 
sun is obviously red, not yellow.<br><br>                               
 
Anyway this seems like one of those sound questions, 
that a good search engine should be able to (try to) answer automatically. 
<br>Alas, as we well know, and as we 
will see now, just because you ask some legitimate question it does not 
mean that there is gonna be only a single, simple answer for it (in general, historically, 
you should 
mistrust --the more the better--   those who claim they 
have a single simple answer to a given question&nbsp;:-)<br>
Let's see how a seeker would proceed in order to deliver a good answer.<br>
<br>
<br><table border=1><tr><td><center><font color=blue>The importance of rephrasing a query</font>
</center></td></tr></table><br>      
First of all, many sites will point out that 
the sun <a href="http://www.noao.edu/image_gallery/html/im0600.html">IS NOT 'just' 
yellow</a>, 
actually. This compels us to rephrase correctly.
The (more correct) question "<font color=blue>What color is the Sun?</font>" 
raises an interesting issue, more closely related to biology and psychology than to physics.
<br> 
Physically, sunlight is just a concoction of photons on different wavelengths, a 
particular mixture with a result very close to the color we call "white" (don't get me 
into color subjectivity now, please).
<br>
Yet since the temperature of the sun varies from 1.55e7 Kelvin  
down to a "photosphere" value of 5800 Kelvin, scientists approximate the 
radiation (light) of the sun with a theoretical model 
called <a href="http://www.alltheweb.com/search?advanced=1&cat=web&cs=utf-8&type=phrase&q=black+body+radiation&jsact=&l=pref&ics=utf-8&cs=utf-8&wf%5Bn%5D=3&wf%5B0%5D%5Br%5D=%2B&wf%5B0%5D%5Bq%5D=&wf%5B0%5D%5Bw%5D=&wf%5B1%5D%5Br%5D=-&wf%5B1%5D%5Bq%5D=&wf%5B1%5D%5Bw%5D=&wf%5B2%5D%5Br%5D=&wf%5B2%5D%5Bq%5D=&wf%5B2%5D%5Bw%5D=&dincl=&dexcl=&geo=&limip=&doctype=&dfr%5Bd%5D=1&dfr%5Bm%5D=1&dfr%5By%5D=1980&dto%5Bd%5D=5&dto%5Bm%5D=2&dto%5By%5D=2003&size%5Bp%5D=%3D&size%5Bv%5D=&size%5Bx%5D=0&depth%5Bp%5D=%3E&depth%5Bv%5D=&hits=10&nooc=off">black body radiation</a>, 
and a simple law (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=wien%27s+law&num=50&hl=en&ie=ISO-8859-1&btnG=Google+Search&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&lr=&as_ft=i&as_filetype=&as_qdr=all&as_occt=any&as_dt=i&as_sitesearch=&safe=images">Wien's law</a>) 
derived from 
the black body radiation, connects 
the wavelenght of the light, in micro-metre, to the temperature 
in Kelvin, /\=2900/T.<br>Using the Sun's surface temperature we 
get /\=0.5 micro-metre, <font color=blue>which corresponds to a <b>yellow</b> light</font>, 
hence the Sun should be yellow, <i>quod erat demonstrandi</i>.<br> 
Moreover its spectral type is G2V (<font color=blue>yellow</font> dwarf star). 
<br>
Yet... yet maybe the sun is <a href="http://casa.colorado.edu/~ajsh/colour/Tspectrum.html">pink</a>! 
<i>"As shown in the table, the Sun's colour is in fact rather similar to that 
of a 5780 K blackbody. It looks peach pinkish, not yellow... 
It has to be emphasized that white is a relative thing, at least to a certain extent. 
It is relative to the daylight spectrum (white) 
that the Sun is peachy pink"</i><br>
 ...as you know, dear future "designers and communicators", 
 colors seem to be pretty relative and elusive concepts&nbsp;:-) 
<br>
<br>
Anyway you can get more info (and, especially, useful info for your future searching activities) 
performing, and understanding, the following query:
<br><br>
      <center>
      <a href="http://www.alltheweb.com/search?cat=web&cs=iso-8859-1&advanced=1&type=phrase&q=what+color+is+the+sun&jsact=&l=pref&ics=iso-8859-1&cs=iso-8859-1&wf%5Bn%5D=3&wf%5B0%5D%5Br%5D=-&wf%5B0%5D%5Bq%5D=business&wf%5B0%5D%5Bw%5D=&wf%5B1%5D%5Br%5D=-&wf%5B1%5D%5Bq%5D=travel&wf%5B1%5D%5Bw%5D=&wf%5B2%5D%5Br%5D=&wf%5B2%5D%5Bq%5D=edu&wf%5B2%5D%5Bw%5D=url.all%3A&embed%5Bswf%5D=x&embed%5Brvp%5D=x&dincl=&dexcl=&geo=&limip=&doctype=&dfr%5Bd%5D=1&dfr%5Bm%5D=1&dfr%5By%5D=1980&dto%5Bd%5D=5&dto%5Bm%5D=2&dto%5By%5D=2003&size%5Bp%5D=%3D&size%5Bv%5D=&size%5Bx%5D=0&depth%5Bp%5D=%3E&depth%5Bv%5D=top&hits=10&nooc=off">what 
color is the sun</a> 
</center>
<br>This FAST search deserves careful evaluation... you will notice that 
it  <font color=blue>must not</font> include the terms "business" and "travel", 
(always "evil terms" for any search, that deserve a good killfile, together with "porn", 
"games", 
"health" and <a href="../nemo_SEO.htm">so on</a>).<br>Moreover the search above 
<font color=blue>should</font> include the "edu" suffix in 
the retrieved URLs, for obviously valid reasons. Note also
that virtually 
ALL the <font color=blue>.com</font> domains could and should 
be mostly eliminated from your searches, with gusto and profit&nbsp;:-)<br> 
Finally we have excluded, also for obvious reasons, 
all those crap and/or useless sites infested with 
"macromedia flash"  frills or with  those pesky 
realvideo/realaudio spywares.    Yeah, that's (part of) what you can do with FAST, on the fly, 
when searching 
(only with fast and not if you use google): fast has an "advanced searching options" 
paradise for seekers.
<br><br> Back to our topic.  
The color of a light emission depends on its temperature. As temperature goes up 
the color goes from dull red through orange, yellow-orange, yellow, green, blue, 
and then to ultraviolet and beyond. The sun's "color" is yellow-green, 
corresponding to a temperature of somewhere around 5000 degrees.

even this lonely result, that looks somehow promising, 
explains (poorly) just why the sun is red at sunset, and not why it is yellow (or whatever) 
most of the time.
<br>Hence the querying user would still be left with <i>de facto</i> no good 
answer, 
since MOST OF THE FOLLOWING answers are completely useless... until a
<a href="http://spacekids.broaddaylight.com/spacekids/FAQ_43_370.shtm">kid oriented</a>  
"What makes our sun yellow?" page, that appears as SECOND 
result in good old (and else equally mistified) google. 
(You would not believe me if I listed 
the amount of: "Golden Sun 'Yellow King'" and similar crap results 
offered there, so I wont do it&nbsp;:-)

This seems like a clever and clear question. The searcher here, apparently,  
wants to know where he can find information about something, he does not 
want to 
have  that information <font color=blue>stright away</font>. 
As seekers know, to know <font color=blue>where 
you can find</font> something is <font color=blue>tantamount to know </font> something, and maybe even better, because you 
do not need to take care of the updates yourself.<br>Well... 
just let's assume this is true, for the sake of this query... 
actually Joe A. USer, probably just wants <u>some concrete and immediate 
info</u> about chlorine and just happens to have formulated 
his query so to allow our interpretation&nbsp;:-)
<br>
<br><table border=1><tr><td><center><font color=blue>When a query 'smells'</font>
</center></td></tr></table><br>   
Apart from an immediate 'pure chemical' <a href="http://www.alltheweb.com/search?advanced=1&cat=web&cs=iso-8859-1&type=all&q=chemical+element+chlorine&jsact=&l=pref&dfr%5Bd%5D=1&dfr%5Bm%5D=1&dfr%5By%5D=1980&dto%5Bd%5D=6&dto%5Bm%5D=2&dto%5By%5D=2003&nooc=off">quest</a>, 
 any seeker will soon 'smell' something... should he not know it already. 

<br>In fact "chlorine" 
is used in the production of safe drinking water the world over, is 
extensively used in the production of paper products, 
dye stuff, textiles, medicines, drugs, antiseptics, 
 solvents, paints, plastics, <font color=blue>and foodstuffs</font>,
and here lies the simple 
problem: it's an extensively used poisonous gas.<br> 
In fact Chlorine is a greenish yellow gas (same color as the sun we have 
seen before&nbsp;:-), 
that irritates the soft tissues ("mucous membranes"). As little as 3.5 ppm can be 
detected as an odour, and 1000 ppm is likely to be fatal 
after a few deep breaths. It was used as a war gas in 1915.<br> 
There are moreover some quite dangerous 
chlorinated chemical components: polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) and 
2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (dioxin), to name the most (in)famous.<br><br>
We may therefore infer that this user wants to know where he can 
find reliable information about <u>how 
dangerous</u> chlorine really is. 
<br>
Maybe <a href="http://www.alltheweb.com/search?advanced=1&cat=web&cs=utf-8&type=all&q=food+chlorine&jsact=&l=pref&nooc=off">in food</a>, 
maybe in the air, as chlorine monoxide (see <a href="http://www.alltheweb.com/search?advanced=1&cat=web&cs=utf-8&type=all&q=ozone+levels+chlorine&jsact=&l=pref&nooc=off">ozone 
levels chlorine</a>)<br><br>Well, as you will see, valuable and objective 
information on these matters represents 
a weak signal, in a web swamped with both <a href="http://www.energyimages.net/chlorine.htm">conspiration theories</a> 
and <a href="http://c3.org/common_questions/">multinationals' propaganda</a> noise.
<br><br>   In this kind of searches the main problem is relying on your own 
evaluation skills 
to maintain a <font color=blue>seeker's perfect equilibrium</font> that will 
allow you to 'cut the web' avoiding the ever lurking risk of falling 
in the simmetric pitfalls of, on one side,  those who take themselves 
and their causes too seriously or, on the other, of  those who have some specific 
economic interest to defend, with teeth and claws, or have been paid in order to 
defend their master's very interests.<br><br>
Where can we find some help and which help can and should we use?<br>      
Well, let's begin with the existing LAWS, that's always a sound approach.<br>
<a href="http://europa.eu.int/servlet/portail/RenderServlet?search=Query&lg=en&nb_docs=25&domain=&coll=JO&in_force=NO&title=&party=&year_from=1999&month_from=1&day_from=1&year_to=&month_to=&day_to=&text=chlorine&from=1%2F1%2F1999&to=">this search</a>, 
performed on the Europa server at europa.eu.int,  
will give you all possible angles to enter into the pertinent eu-law tunnels. 
<br>For instance 
an interesting reading would be the   
Commission Directive of 26 July 2002 "for the determination of levels of dioxins 
in feedingstuffs", in the EU-Official Journal L 209 2002
<br><hr></font><font color="#646464">
As a small digression, it could be useful in Europe, for all civil society and "grass root" 
organisations, actually, for anyone, to be able to check

<b><u>ANY</u></b> (EU) language 'on the fly' using the following (powerful) mask:<br>

Let's go on. Let's see what the two sides of the same coin look like. 
One side will be found with <a href="http://www.alltheweb.com/search?cat=web&cs=iso-8859-1&advanced=1&type=all&q=chlorine+danger+hazard&jsact=&l=pref&ics=iso-8859-1&cs=iso-8859-1&wf%5Bn%5D=3&wf%5B0%5D%5Br%5D=&wf%5B0%5D%5Bq%5D=org&wf%5B0%5D%5Bw%5D=url.all%3A&wf%5B1%5D%5Br%5D=-&wf%5B1%5D%5Bq%5D=porn&wf%5B1%5D%5Bw%5D=&wf%5B2%5D%5Br%5D=&wf%5B2%5D%5Bq%5D=environment&wf%5B2%5D%5Bw%5D=&embed%5Bswf%5D=x&embed%5Brvp%5D=x&dincl=&dexcl=&geo=&limip=&doctype=&dfr%5Bd%5D=1&dfr%5Bm%5D=1&dfr%5By%5D=1980&dto%5Bd%5D=6&dto%5Bm%5D=2&dto%5By%5D=2003&size%5Bp%5D=%3D&size%5Bv%5D=&size%5Bx%5D=0&depth%5Bp%5D=%3E&depth%5Bv%5D=&hits=75&nooc=off">this search</a>
<br>Note the constraints:   we search for 
<font color=blue>chlorine danger hazard</font>, the results 
should include 
<font color=blue>org</font> in the URL, should include <font color=blue>environment</font> and not <font color=blue>porn</font> 
in the text.

<br><br>
Now again, searching through those specific "chlorine" laws we have 
found above, (and for this you will now 
build your <i>ad hoc</i> searchstrings on your own) 
we will find 'from the other side'
<a href="http://www.chlorine.org.uk/moreabout.htm">those that defend chlorine against the laws</a> 
("chlorine: life depends on it"), because this chemical product 
allows (huge) private gains,  
and hence -as usual- those that gain from something dangerous 
dislike and denigrate public intervention against its use (did I say tobacco?).<br>
Yet seekers -even when convinced- should always "run with the hare and hunt with the 
hounds" just in case&nbsp;:-) &nbsp; Mor egenerally there is 
always much to learn from the very structure of the 
arguments of the counterpart.<br>
Isn't such a <a href="http://www.chlorine.org.uk/ecolabel.htm">hard 
defence</a> a little suspicious <i>per se</i>?<br><br>
Anyway, with the help of both 'fields', 
we have already found a couple of entrances to parts of the web where our user 
could   "<font color=blue>find information about the chemical element chlorine</font>", 
haven't we?

<br><br> <u><font size=+2>"Ask Jeeves" own answers:</font></u>
<br><br>      A lot of periodic tables, commercial crap ("When chemistry is a Passion, anything is possible"), 
chemical 'data sheets', commercial chlorine defenders, chlorine industry... you'll have a 
hard time finding some objective info about the dangers of Chlorine with this search.
<br><br>
Maybe     Joe User wanted only Chlorine's position on the periodic table, but I doubt it.

size=+3>How do I find the Italian national hymn?</font><br>
<font color=red>quomodo</font> ~ regional searching</center></td></tr></table>
</center>
<br><br> 
 Now this is a cleverly formulated question! 
Joe does not ask actually where this anthem is, he asks <font color=blue>how to</font> 
find it. Well... "we are here for this"&nbsp;:-) 
<br>Let's imagine he wants 'la totale': text of the hymn, author, 
mod, mp3 and history of the hymn.<br>How would we 
proceed?<br><br>
        In order to get the text of a song the search is trivial 
 any main search engine 
would do, let's just use hotbot for the sake of it: <a href="http://www.hotbot.com/adv.asp?prov=Inktomi&query=%22Italian+national+hymn%22&ps=&loc=searchbox&tab=web&lang=&dfi=&dfe=&region=&wfr=&wfw=&wfq=&wfr=&wfw=&wfq=&wfc=2&past=&dateop=after&month=1&day=&year=2002&pcu=">italian national hymn</a> 
which has the added advantage of giving us immediately, the english search string notwithstanding, 
and as first result, an italian site that will cut the mustard.<br><br>
<pre>Fratelli d'Italia,
l'Italia s'è desta,
dell'elmo di Scipio
s'è cinta la testa.
Dov'è la vittoria?
Le porga la chioma,
che schiava di Roma
Iddio la creò.</pre>
The hymn is longer, and --as almost all national hymns of the world-- 
pretty preposterous and 
warmongerish.  But we have already enough angles as it is: 
"inno di mameli", "fratelli d'Italia", "desta elmo cinta testa", and, if you scroll 
down, more and more historical data, with even a bibliographical reference that satisfies 
our evaluation strainers.   
The same site offers a <a href="http://www.ilsegnalibro.com/fratelli.mid">mid of the hymn</a> 
as well.  Two pigeons, one stone.
<br>
<br><table border=1><tr><td><center><font color=blue>mp3: caveat emptor... gaudet fur&nbsp;:-)</font>
</center></td></tr></table><br>   
In order to find any mp3 music, a seeker, even if he does not speak the local language, in this case 
italian, 
would immediately go <a href="../regional.htm">regional</a>. Mp3 searches are pro-actively 
hampered on the main search engines by the long whips of the "copyright enforcers", 
who -failing to be able to outlaw mp3- are swamping the web with fake 'free mp3' sites 
where you will never find anyhing but commercial crap 
(<a href="../rabbits.htm">other methods</a> are required to 
find copyright-sensitive mp3s&nbsp;:-)<br> A national hymn shouldn't be copyright sensitive tough, 
and you would be able to find 
this mp3 <font color=blue>even</font> on google or fast.<br> 
The <a href="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=%22italian+search+engines%22&num=100&safe=off">main italian</a> 
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?&as_qdr=all&q=%22motori+di+ricerca+italiani%22&num=100&safe=off">search engines</a> are  arianna, virgilio, google.it, 
kataweb and tin. Let's use arianna. And now let's see, there is even a specific mp3 
search-tag... a national hymn should not have too many copyright petty problems as we said, 
so let's just input 
<font color=blue>mameli</font>, and, loo: 15 results, with useful parameters like 'dimensione' and 'ultima verifica'.
Let's assume that for our purposes, the bigger is the better, and, therefore, let us 
choose <a href="http://digilander.libero.it/calciopalermo/download/Inno_Mameli_Cantato.mp3">this one</a>.
<br><br>
Now, that was a quick job.
<br><br>
But that was only ONE way of doing it. Going back to regional searching, 
you can be sure that searching for mameli.htm, mameli.mp3, desta scipio cinta testa, fratelli.mp3, innonazionale.htm 
(you get the hang of it) on the regional search engines may give some useful 
results. The same approach would be even more important if we had searched 
for a more "copyright sensitive" 
target, say, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=%22buscadores+hispanos%22&num=100&safe=off">Les Ketchup, aserejé</a> on a Spanish 
search engine.<br><br>
Let's try a couple of these approaches out: <br>
<a href="http://www.google.it/search?q=mameli.mp3&ie=ISO-8859-1&hl=it&btnG=Cerca+con+Google&lr=lang_it">mameli.mp3</a> with <a hrf="http://www.google.it/">google.it</a>
<br>
<a href="http://search.virgilio.it/search/cgi/search.cgi?qs=desta+scipio+cinta+testa&dv=&dpg=&db=v&tric=base&pg=0&vrs=0&vrg=10&cb=&ly=vs&l=XX&es=0&cerca.x=18&cerca.y=8">desta scipio 
cinta testa</a>   with virgilio


 <br><br> <u><font size=+2>"Ask Jeeves" own answers:</font></u>
<br><br>     For once the two first "real" 
results in "ask jeeves" (after the commercial crap) 
are relevant,  even if 
they are both pretty outdated and 
not of top quality, and could help Joe User.
The rest of the links, as well as the commercial overhead, are completely useless.

<br><br> 
       This time we will proceed 'tout betement', since I confess that I do not 
know really much about the ancient chariot battle of Kadesh, and surely do not remember 
the date it was fought.<br> 
<br>
Let's dive together in the history of mankind 
using search engines as a springboard&nbsp;:-)
<br><br>


Ok, let's simply smash <a href="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=When+was+the+battle+of+Kadesh+fought%3F&num=10&hl=en&ie=ISO-8859-1&btnG=Google+Search&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&lr=&as_ft=i&as_filetype=&as_qdr=all&as_occt=any&as_dt=i&as_sitesearch=&safe=off">When was the battle of Kadesh fought?</a> in google, 
like Joe User has done above on "ask jeeves".
<br><br>And in the first result (<a href="http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Styx/7480/">http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Styx/7480/</a>) 
you can already start to swim in the signal (click on the triangles) and you will also 
find the following snippet: 
"<font color=blue>If you want to read more about the Battle of Kadesh, 
I recommend <i>Perspectives on the Battle of Kadesh</i>, by Hans Goedicke and 
<i>Road to Kadesh: A Historical Interpretation of the Battle Reliefs of 
King SETY I at Karnak</i> by William J. Murnane</font>"<br>
Woah! A loving amateur! "a senior at the University of Evansville (sic... we'll have to check if 
they really have a university in that godzilla-forgotten place&nbsp;:-), 
majoring in classical archaeology and history, with a minor in anthropology" 
That's among the best findings one 
can retrieve from the web, bar the real sources. He sits on google second position as well. 
And in third position another amateur: andré dollinger <a href="http://www.reshafim.org.il/ad/egypt/ramseskadeshcampaign.htm">http://www.reshafim.org.il/ad/egypt/ramseskadeshcampaign.htm</a>. Both 
sites are quite useful to dive deeper, 
 no wonder --you may think-- google is the main search engine "of choice".

<br>
<br><table border=1><tr><td><center><font color=blue>use directories as a springboard!</font>
</center></td></tr></table><br> 

But wait! Actually these two sites appear (almost) WHATEVER main search engine we use... 
how comes? Does everyone have algos as good as google ones?
<br><br>No. The real reason we get these two results both in google and in 
most other sarch engines is that they are listed in <a href="http://dmoz.org/">dmoz</a> (and 
of course copied  in 
google's "<a href="http://directory.google.com/">web directory</a>") as:
<pre>Society: History: By Time Period: Ancient: Wars and Conflicts</pre>
Which proves once more how important it is to <a href="http://dmoz.org/">check dmoz</a> 
for authoritative 
"start_stations" when you begin a dive into the web&nbsp;:-)
<br><br>
Now, although these results <u>look</u> good and promising, 
we cannot just rest there. For a start Warner (our amateur in first & second google-position) says it was fought on <font color=red>1275 B.C.</font>, 
while Dollinger, at reshafim, (in third position) says <font color=red>1299 B.C.</font>. C'mon, we'r supposed to be seekers after all. 
<br>Let's do a little more and 
find the real SOURCES describing the battle of Kadesh. Everytime 
seekers are confronted with historical (and -come to think of it, also- non historical) queries, 
they would be well advised to search for the <font color=blue>authoritative sources</font> for a given 
topic.<br><br>Of course we would be able to find some signal with a simple query like 
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=ISO-8859-1&as_qdr=all&q=sources+of+the+battle+of+Kadesh&btnG=Google+Search">sources of the battle of Kadesh</a> 
 (note that there are NO quotes in this case). This would 
give us enough material to start our in-depth trip to the sources.
<br>Yet, once more, there is a "simpler" springboard: <a href="http://search.dmoz.org/cgi-bin/search?search=battle+of+kadesh">dmoz</a> again.
<br>Note the answer: <font color=blue>Open Directory Categories (1-2 of 2) Society: History:

<b><u>AND</u></b>
<font color=blue>Society: History: By Time Period: Ancient: Africa: Egypt: Texts</font>   <a href="http://www.hillsdale.edu/academics/history/War/Classical/Egypt/1294-Kadesh.htm">http://www.hillsdale.edu/academics/history/War/Classical/Egypt/1294-Kadesh.htm</a>.

from the egyptian hieroglyphics,  taken from <font color=blue>James Henry 
Brested, <i>Ancient Records of Egypt: Historical 
Documents</i>. (Chicago: 1906), III:136-147 </font>. The time, here, 
is <font color=red>1294 B.C.</font> (and is part of the URL). 

<br>But, wait! The REAL date here is "<font color=red>Year 5, the second month of 
the third season tenth month, on the ninth day</font>", 
plus "<font color=red>many days after this</font>", not exactly 1294 B.C. in 
the source, isn't it?

So let's use this very document to find more pointers, 
we will extract one phrase out of it:

<br>
There are three main sources from which the Battle of Kadesh can 
be reconstructed.<br>
1.) Egyptian reliefs from temples 
of Ramesses II, especially from the Ramessium.<br>
2.) there is an epic poem, written by an unknown 
talented Egyptian scribe, that recorded most of the 
events who took place in the Battle of Kadesh .<br> 
3.) Finally, there are few Hittite records which provide accurate information, 
and they are not as extensive as the Egyptian records.

The <a href="http://www.geocities.com/farfarer2001/hittite_letters/hittite_annals_index.html">Hittite records</a> of the Battle of Kadesh threw a very different light 
upon that skirmish than what had hitherto been understood from 
the boastful accounts of Rameses II. Carved on temple walls all over Egypt 
were loud declamations of how Rameses had trampled all over 
the Hittites and by his personal bravery had slaughtered 
his enemies in by the hundreds. Once the Hittites could present 
their side of the story, however, we discovered that 
the battle had been a very close run thing from the 
Egyptian point of view and Rameses was lucky to get 
out of it with a whole skin.

<br> 

Seekers should keep in mind  for <a href="http://www.archaeologia.com/egypt-b.htm">historical 
researches</a>, that  many  sources, 
were often optimally compiled  (collated) a century ago or earlier, 
investing more 
time on this that it would be possible today, and with 
a more 'broad' knowledge and MUCH less "commercial mind" 
than any (eventual) more recent collections... should similar 
attempts have even been made recently at all... editing ancient sources is a 
lacklustre work from 
the sheer commercial point of view that now rulez, and it 
does not make any sense anymore, in today's 
"advertisement-dictatorships". Today's "professors", even when they 
know their ancient aramaic, greek or egyptian (and many do not 
and read only translations) simply do 
not collate sources any more, 
nor --probably-- would know how to do it correctly anyway: it's the 
abrupt decadence of all non immediately 
"commercially rentable"  arts, knowledges and lore.


<br><br>
As a side note, it is interesting to see that the 
<a href="http://www.etana.org/abzu/">abzu/etana</a> search engine  
does not even seem  to 
mention this important battle.
<br><br>So, what is the date of the battle of Kadash?<br>
Frankly: I do not know. But if the authority on the sources 
is James Henry Breasted, then let's have 
a look at what <font color=blue>HE</font> says on these matters. 
<br>
I'll leave to the reader the pleasure of 
finding on line his <i>A history of the ancient egyptians</i>, London, Murray, 1924, 
where he states: "<font color=blue>About the end of April of his fifth year (</font><font color=red>1288 B.C.</font><font color=blue>), 
when the rains of Syria had ceased, Ramses marched out of Tharu...</font>.
Hence <font color=red>1288 BC</font> may be as wrong a date as anything else 
proposed, yet would seem, to an evaluating seeker, 
more appropriate as a result.

his beef quickly, in this case... only he would not have had ANY CHANCE to check if the beef 
was sound and if "his" 
date was the correct one (and, note, <u>exactly the same</u> would have happened if he had used google or fast

You are in for a surprise: modern biotechnology 
<a href="http://www.alltheweb.com/search?advanced=1&cat=web&cs=iso-8859-1&type=all&q=%22father+of+modern+biotechnology%22+&jsact=&l=pref&ics=iso-8859-1&cs=iso-8859-1&wf%5Bn%5D=3&wf%5B0%5D%5Br%5D=%2B&wf%5B0%5D%5Bq%5D=&wf%5B0%5D%5Bw%5D=&wf%5B1%5D%5Br%5D=-&wf%5B1%5D%5Bq%5D=&wf%5B1%5D%5Bw%5D=&wf%5B2%5D%5Br%5D=&wf%5B2%5D%5Bq%5D=&wf%5B2%5D%5Bw%5D=&dincl=&dexcl=&geo=&limip=&doctype=&dfr%5Bd%5D=1&dfr%5Bm%5D=1&dfr%5By%5D=1980&dto%5Bd%5D=7&dto%5Bm%5D=2&dto%5By%5D=2003&size%5Bp%5D=%3D&size%5Bv%5D=&size%5Bx%5D=0&depth%5Bp%5D=%3E&depth%5Bv%5D=&hits=10&nooc=on">is a little bastard</a> &nbsp;:-)

<br><br>
Ahi ahi... let's start:<ul><li>
"<a href="http://www.enzymes.co.uk/biotecintro1.htm">Louis Pasteur</a> is regarded by many as the "father" of modern biotechnology by demonstrating microbial fermentation around 1876." 
</li><li>
"<a href="http://www.warrenpharmaceuticals.com/bod.html">Dr. Rathmann</a> is acclaimed as the founding father of modern biotechnology..." 
</li><li>
"<a href="http://www.udel.edu/PR/Messenger/00/1/nobel.html">Dr. Nathans</a>, who was known as the father of modern biotechnology, received the 1978 Nobel Prize in medicine..."
</li><li>
"<a href="http://www.thetech.org/nmot/search.cfm?kiosk=Off&st=showall">Robert Swanson</a>, 1999, Father of modern biotechnology..."
</li><li>
Australia's revered scientist and 1960 Nobel Prize winner for 
medicine <a href="http://www.upi.com/view.cfm?StoryID=13032002-105403-2823r ">Macfarlane Burnet</a>, seen as the father of modern biotechnology, stressed the economic advantage of biological warfare: 
"Its use has the tremendous advantage of not destroying the enemy's industrial potential which can then be taken over intact."
(isn't it funny what kind of people get the nobel prizes?)
</li></ul>

Not bad, and it looks  appropriate to me to consider 
the last of this list, the criminal Burnet, as the real father 
of modern biotechnology. Serves well 
modern biotechnologists, who are worse than atomic bombs scientists. 
After a nuclear conflict, let's say
couple of thousand years later, we still have a chance to see some trees on this planet again. 
The genetically modified concoctions of these "modern biotechnologists", 
will not go away until the sun dies. These <i>de facto </i> "mad-scientists" are 
all happily working for the commercial powers that be, creating pigs with 60 ribs, 
that cannot even move around, eggs more "squared" than oval,  
for easy-packaging purposes, "terminator" seeds (sterile, so that you 
can sell more), other "plants" that are 
able to withstand lethal doses of agrotoxins aimed 
at anything biological that could grow in their midst,
 and "new tomatoes" as gorgeous in looking, awful in tasting 
and dangerous in perspective as Sneewhite's apple.

Have a look at the <a href="http://www.wri.org/wri/biodiv/b13-gbs.html">Guidelines for Minimizing the Potential Social and Ecological Dangers of Biotechnology</a> 
to evaluate the issues at stake and find some useful links.

I would say <a href="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=%22gregor+mendel%22+%22biotechnology%22&num=100">Gregor Mendel</a> with his studies of

Of course you could google <a href="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=&num=10&hl=en&ie=ISO-8859-1&btnG=Google+Search&as_epq=acoustic+neuroma&as_oq=&as_eq=&lr=&as_ft=i&as_filetype=&as_qdr=all&as_occt=any&as_dt=i&as_sitesearch=edu&safe=images">"acoustic neuroma" site:edu</a>

<br><br>
Then, let's see some more examples (you will be able to dig a lot more, on your own, 
with any   good specialized search engine), Joe User
 could go to <a href="http://www.cancer.gov/cancerinfo/literature">cancerlit</a>,

Of course a FAR better "local" choice would be the

<br>Alas! In this case he should not only translate 
his "acoustic neuroma" into a "<font color=blue>névrome acoustique</font>" 
(damn die-hard French)... he should 
also know how to enter a closed database 
from outside! (Woah! This would bring us immediately to the next, and final, part of today's

<br><br> 

Once more  we encounter a problem of evaluation again, <u>especially acute</u> 
in the case of medical information.<br>
      Some medical information on the web is -simply put- false, and many 
sites are not updating their pages. 
Moreover on the web  even correct 
information may be consumed "out of context": even accurate 
data needs to be placed within their proper framework to be interpreted correctly.
You know how it often happens -when reading a medical book- that you just feel 
to have yourself  all the symptoms described for every kind of illness? Well, 
imagine what people can find out on the web when looking for their own symptoms&nbsp;:-)
<br><br>  
 Recognizing and evaluating authors' 
bias and rhetoric (being aware of fallacious arguments or manipulative reasoning), 
differentiating between fact and opinion, examining assumptions 
(exploring reasons and warrants),  
and knowing how to individuate reputable sources are skills many 
web users have not developed. These skills are especially 
crucial for health information, and especially when <u>you</u> are 
looking for answers. 
<br><br>
You may use "the five evaluation 
<a href="http://www.toutelapoesie.com/poemes/rimbaud/voyelles.htm">vowels</a>", when checking a site:
 <font color=blue>A</font>ccuracy (of the info, checking versus other sites),

<font color=blue>E</font>thics (commercial oriented sites would kill your mama for money), 
<font color=blue>I</font>dentity (of the Author, and his credentials), 
<font color=blue>O</font>bjectivity (some 
text -<a href="../realicra/exegesis.htm">exegesis</a> skills would  help), 
<font color=blue>U</font>pdate (stale sites are not good).

 <br><br> <u><font size=+2>"Ask Jeeves" own answers:</font></u>
<br><br>Here <a href="http://www.ask.com/main/askjeeves.asp?ask=What+is+the+neurological+condition+acoustic+neuroma%3F&o=0&qsrc=1&meta=1&IMAGE1.x=13&IMAGE1.y=10">they are</a>. 
<br><font color=blue>Should</font> 
our Joe A. User be able to ignore the 
commercial noise in the first positions: e.g. "The Foot Health Network Help for Foot Care"
(and such an attitude would demand an "attention span"  
of more than a few seconds, which is, I fear, something
pretty rare nowadays among TV-zombies and MMS-slaves&nbsp;:-( 
<br><font color=blue>then</font> 
"ask jeeves" will indeed give him some signal, on the lower positions. 
<br><br>
Alas, most of these sites are in turn 
commercial perverted, praying on hypocondiac webusers.<br>
Yet there is at least one exception: 
Joe will find in prominent position the
"General Practice Notebook 
<a href="http://www.gpnotebook.co.uk/MedwebPage.cfm?ID=1570373632">Acoustic neuroma</a>").
 that 
seems quite promising.  It 
will tell Joe at once that an acoustic neuroma is "<font color=blue>a benign neoplasm 
of the Schwann cells of the eighth cranial nerve</font>", but the very moment 
Joe should want to check 
"clinical features", or
"associated conditions", or
investigations, or
treatment, the site will ask Joe for some personal data.<br>

<br>Joe could give him bogus data, of course, 
and slowly use the resources provided there to re-build a more correct answer,
starting a dive that would bring him to some of the results we have listed 
above, yet  such 
an approach cannot be considered satisfactory 
from a searcher point of view. In fact, 
come to think of it, I do not suggest you should use "ask jeeves" at all.
