<tr><td colspan=3><center><br><i>Well, "Eyeball 
grasping" is all the rage nowadays, and more and more dirty tricks are used to force 
you to look at completely useless banners and idiotical 
advertisements that noone in his right mind would click onto. Why this actually happens beats me: in my experience and world, in order to find the sort of 
people that would really eventually click onto one of these banners you would have to visit a center 
for mentally handicapped in their terminal phase. Maybe I'm wrong, though, and in the real "Guinea Pigs" world that the advertisers dream of, there really exist hundred thousands of slaves who happily click on any commercial abomination they see and then - drooling for pleasure - buy the crap they deserve. I doubt it, though.<br>Anyway it is our holy duty to destroy these tricksters: they grasp our eyeballs? We'll grasp 
their - quite sensible - commercial balls. Here you go with a simple, but effective, essay by +Tsehp</i><br><br></center></td></tr>

 Ads are sneaked more and more inside your computer. Even if you pay for  
a
program, its conceptors now don't hesitate to forward advertisement you NEVER WANTED 
to you. The money  
they
get from their applications is not enough: they need you to click on  
their
"big bucks" banners.

Almost everybody knows this application, it's ane asy to use "meta search bot" that  
uses the 
most current search engines to perform your search. It's one of the most used, therefore, 
similar to what Micro$oft does, they (try to) use  
an almost 
monopolistic situation with the aim to transform your computer into a mall.<br>Without  
asking you
if they are authorised to.<br><br>Just try this : download the  
copernic 2000 pro version 4.0 (it will self update to 4.1)
Use a regular, non burned serial (a lot of keygens exists), at first  
launch, it shows no
ads and everything is working fine. But this tool is auto updating to  
have the last
links to search engines, and when it does it shows you at the next  
searches beautiful
banners at the top of your screen. Of course you bought it and you can  
disable the
ads : tools,options,uncheck display ads while searching. But at the next  
update (almost
every day) it will self check this option and show you again the ads, so  
they are sure
you will see at least one. You'll be bored to uncheck this option  
everytime and will
give up, covered by ads.<br><br>Of course it is possible to  
destroy all this devious - and illegal - doing, and since you should 
have the right
to control what happens inside your pc, I will show how to perform an easy  
crack. <br><br>

<br><br>
The first step is not to hurry on softices breakpointing. Sit down, use some good ole "zen cracking" attitude and  
think a little about the facts you know.<br><br>Now, since there is a feature to remove the ads - for people 
rich enough to 
escape the advertisement hell reserved for slaves and poor sods - this means that 
this target MUST keep a flag for  
it, a flag that decides wether the owner has enough money to escape advertisement or not. Of course this flag (let's say either true "poor_sucker=0 give him hell" or false "poor_sucker=1 he may  escape without ads") must be either inside a kore or less "hidden" file 
or inside 
the registry.<br>Dead easy, of course: We use the <font color=blue>regmon</font> tool 
and check and uncheck the display ads option. Bingo! it's  
inside the registry.<br>In fact it is located 
at<br>
<font color=blue>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Copernic  
Technologies\Copernic4Plus\Preferences\showad</font><br><br>If this key contains ffffffff, copernic will show them, if contains  
00000000 it will
not.<br><br>You can also simply delete this key: the ad banners will be gone.<br>
<br>Unfortunately, at the next links update, this crap key appears again.<br>
Let's kill it.<br>

CODE:0056EA76                 jz      short loc_0_56EAA0</pre>
<br>The call 464e68 checks for the showad key, created if your serial  
is not registered into their
server, then al contains 1 if so, the jz to 56eb06 is not taken and it  
shows the ads.<br>
<br>If you force the jz to jump, the ads will never be showed.

I usually don't like cracks, sauf for mere  learning purposes, and ususally 
I would encourage readers to buy programs, but our patience is really tested by 
these guys, who take your money and at the same time spit on your faces with  
this awful banner  autoshow feature. So I encourage you to create this patch and spread  
it with the keygen, until those guys remove the feature on the next version.
