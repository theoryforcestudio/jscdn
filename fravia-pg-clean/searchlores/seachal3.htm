<i>Please note that your Lab-assignement is to find THE MORE ACCURATE DATA 
about each 
query target <u>and to</u> describe exactly all steps and paths you have followed. 
Use pencil and paper, 
you wont regret it... see the <a href="seachal3.htm#tips">tips</a> below.<br><br> 
Note that we will not use words like 'terror' or 'terrorism' in this search assignement: As 
all reversers know: 'terrorism' is a 'relative' definition: 
Historically, wherever it happens, 
if violence is committed in defiance of the existing regime, it is 
usually called 'terror'.  
If it is committed by the regime's security forces or an affiliated 
militia, it is not called 'terror' but something else (a rich list of 'non-terrorist' terms 
awaits you if you investigate the media descriptions of the warring factions and the 
various tribal warlords used against the Taliban in Nord-Afghanistan).
<br>We should also not forget that 
definitions may suddendly change upon time: the Taliban, 
for instance,  were for a long time  "freedom fighters" before being transformed into 
"particularly fanatical fundamentalists and woman-haters". 
<br> <br>
Keep in mind that however, even if we do not use such 'media-rhetorical related' terms, 
 no one, at least here in Europe,  
can seriously view  
Bin Laden, or his al-Qaeda organisation, or Sadam Hussein,  
as being something even remotely related to "Good". 
<br>But for sure we still view our own political elites, and the ones in the States, 
all together now happily  
fighting against "terrorism", with more than 
a hint of suspicion.<br><br>
Note that, ironically, the infantile, childish division among 'good guys' 
and 'bad guys' is just the kind of attitude that fundamentalists 
would (literally) kill for.<br> 
The 11/9 attacks, with their unspeakable horror, 
were the brainchild -and other side of the mirror- of a similar bigotry. </i>

<font color=red>1)</font> <u>AFOREMATH: Saudian deeds?</u>
<br></font></font><font size=+1>

<uL><li>A few days <u>before</u> the 11/9 attack, the head of the Saudi secret service (Prince Turki Al-Faisal), 
after almost 20 years 
in office, has   been sacked without an explanation. Are these data true? Do they mean something?
<br>
What exactly are the relations between official Saudi arabian circles and the (mostly saudian)
componentes of the attack commandos?  Who were <u>exactly</u> the 
components of those commandos? (Names? Background? 'Curriculum Vitae'?)<br>How many wre they? 
19? more?  (<a href="seachal3.htm#possib">Here a possible list</a>, must be checked)
<br>
Were 
some of them trained by the CIA or even directly paid by it anytime in their life? Were some of those 
giving orders to them trained by the CIA or paid by it? <br>
Who, when, why, how much, paid the  
Maktab al-Khidimat (MAK) movement?
</li><li>
Is it credible that both CIA and FBI did not have/receive any clue about a such complex plan? 
What about other secret services?<br>
What about the FBI’s own counter- terrorism division, the Radical Fundamentalist Unit: RFU?<br> 
What about the National Security Agency, NSA?<br>
What about the "National Imagery Office" based in the Pentagon? (this 
agency manages all U.S. satellite intelligence gathering). 
What about the special "FBI’s Osama bin-Laden unit" 
(stationed at Federal Plaza, the FBI’s office in New York)?
<br>
<br>Mossad warnings? M15 warnings?  French DST ("Direction de la Surveillance
du Territoire")
warnings?
 <br>
<br>
Is it simple incompetence 
or connivence? Who exactly is responsible for what?
</li></ul>

<br>Suggestion: there are enough angles, above, to start a good query work right now...

      "Good" versus "Evil"?<br>
An "axes" of "evil"?<br>A crusade?<br> A war against "terrorism"?<br>
    Countering a regime of particularly fanatical fundamentalists and woman-haters?
<br>
<br>

Who when began to use such terms? Why?<br>
 And back to our searching 
task: the very nature of the attack that prompted this "war" (or crusade or
campaign) seems CREATED in order to  make it easy to sell
these developments as a battle of "Good" versus "Evil"). 
 <br>
<br>
Should we apply some rhetorical reversing to the news / attitudes sparkled by 
and after  
the 11/9 event? Would it bring us significant knowledge to do so?

<br><br> 
Too neat to be true?<br>
Those two airplanes hitting the twin towers (the twin towers!) with such 
"hollywoodian" precision / color and light and sound effects, seem 
'thought' to be made in order to inprint our retinas with unforgettable images,
 that will  for sure accompany  (and give some 
comfort to) <u>any</u> soldier fighting for the "good/true God/christian/white" 
side when asked to kill someone 
somewhere that will be (allegedely) 
related with such an horrible deed.      
<br><br>
"Not even Godzilla would have been able to provoke something like that in New York": is this comment to the 
11/9 attack worth 
analysing in depth?

What could possibly have motivated -- and still motivates -- the 
USA and Europe propping up of blatantly repressive non-democracies 
like the Saudi and Kuwaiti royal families, or regimes like that of 
Reza Pahlavi, the last Shah of Iran? Or pouring billions into the coffers of Saddam Hussein 
in the ’80s, duh? <br>Or even creating and training the possible 
 mastermind of the 11/9 attacks himself: Osama bin Laden... Was he actually 
trained by the CIA? (Directly or through Pakistan's  
Inter-Services Intelligence agency-ISI)<br> 
Was he a 'blowback'? Who were the contacts he had inside ISI and CIA??
<br>  
How much does "oil" play a role in this bazaar?<br>
Who produces how much? And for how long? 
<br>Who has oil enough? Who needs it badly? Who can switch to 
something else?     Who cannot?

<br><br>
Is it true that media avoid whenever possible to state the obvious matter of fact   
that 
the US-military is in the Middle East 
only to guarantee that whatever comes out of the ground 
is exploitable and controlled by American multinationals?  Is this really such a 
obvious matter of fact?    Is this a matter of fact at all?

<br><br>
More specifically: is it true that 
the world is <a href="http://www.bp.com/centres/energy2002/2001inreview.asp">drawing 
down</a> its oil <a href="http://www.bp.com/centres/energy2002/oil/reserves.asp">reserves</a> 
at an unprecedented rate, with supplies likely to be constrained by 
 global production capacity by 2010?  
<br><br>
Is it true that the OPEC countries are ready to switch to the <a href="euroiraq.htm">euro</a> 
and that the first one that did it, towards end 2000, was Iraq?

<hr></fonT><i>Some tips before leaping into it</i>:<ol><lI>
How easy (or difficult) was it to figure out the correct approach? </li><li>
Was the  formulation adequate to help you plan your search?</li><li> 
Which search-approaches and strategies did you choose?</lI><li>
Did you use any "classical" search engine? If so which ones?</li><li>
Did you use any "special" search engine? If so which ones?</li><li>
How many results did you retrieve?  </li><li>
What proportion of the results were relevant to your perceived information requirements?   </li><li>
How current were the results? How many 404s?        </li><li>
Was the amount of detail displayed with the results enough to allow you tho evaluate?  </li><li>
Was the order in which the results were displayed evident or apparently illogical?  </li><li>
What other features contribute to (or detract from) the utility of the tools and approaches you choosed? </li><lI>
Did you time your query?
</lI></ol>
<i>Eh, of course you don't need to answer all the questions above. The purpose of these 
labs is to let you understand how important it is to be more "systematic" when searching the web. You may 
hop, you may leap, you may be a grasshopper or an ant... the only decisive 
factor is the success 
of your query and the time you had to employ: you got the targets you were searching for 
quickly? You won.
