<hr><i>Well, iixii had to send me this file twice, since opera's email function is malfunctioning as well :-)<br>
A great essay in the best reversers' tradition: we ameliorate our tool, we fix bugs, we do whatever 
we want and fancy with our software... and the people at Opera (who should be ashamed to let 
such a good program on a bug infested downhill path) should thank us (in this case iixii), 
gefaellig... have a look and enjoy (and then, by all means, use the ameliorated version of Opera)

Update: 19.11.00 (javascript bug, email sort bug, attachment bug)<BR>
Last Update: 24.11.00 (mail retrieving bug finally corrected)
</I>
</CENTER>
<BR>
OK, so you just downloaded Opera for Windows 4.02 -- The Best Getting Even
Better --, and discovered that it really has got <B>worse</B>. The major
version change means they have completely redone it, and introduced LOTS of
new bugs on the way. Nonetheless, it is a great program, small, efficient,
lots of features you always wanted, and with the email and news integration,
it is a really good all-in-one browser.<BR>
Just that the email client is the source of the most horribly obvious bugs.
The minor version "02" suggests it isn't exactly a beta version anymore,
but some bugs are so overwhelmingly stupid one might think the programmers
are blind or constantly drunk.<BR>
Anyway, I sat down and did what I had to do. Apart from fixing real bugs,
there were things which I wanted Opera to do MY way, so there are two sections
below, the first deals with real bugfixes, the second with "adjustments".
The bytes which have to be changed in the appropriate DLL and the
corresponding offsets are given in hexadecimal. If you don't know how
to do byte patches (which by the way you SHOULD, there are quite enough
tutorials and tools out there), the fixed and tweaked files are available
for download at the bottom, but of course just downloading and replacing them
denies you the possibility of choosing which bugfixes/tweaks to apply and
which not.<BR>
Feel free to submit this site to any mailing lists/search engines/discussion
groups/FAQs, it is important to reach those desperate Opera users which would
otherwise turn their backs on this good program and return to Nutscrape or
Internet Exploiter.<BR>
If you have any suggestions concerning this site or discover/repair bugs which
aren't addressed here yet, <A HREF="mailto:iixii@newmail.net">email me</A>.
<BR><BR>
Hope this helps,<BR>
IIXII<BR>
<BR><BR>
All byte changes apply to OMAIL32.DLL, whose size should be 262193 bytes, to
be sure you have exactly the same version.<BR>

The newsgroups and mailing lists are being FLOODED with complaints about this
unbelievable failure of notice. I just had to include the disassembled source
(for those who are interested).<BR>
This is the guilty part of OMAIL32.DLL:

use_default_val:
</PRE>
It's part of a function which converts all preferences which are numbers
(also on/off preferences). As you can plainly see, there is an argument to
the function which tells it to always use the default value if it's zero.
I suppose the programmers put this in for testing, BUT FORGOT TO REMOVE IT
AGAIN, causing Opera to use DEFAULT VALUES every time you restarted it.
The astonishingly simple solution is to delete the jump. 
<PRE>
OFFSET 1D368   74 3A -> 90 90
</PRE>
<U><A NAME=colsort>Column sort bug</A></U><BR>
In a mail folder window, you can click on the column headers of the mail
list and the mails are sorted accordingly. This setting is saved, on opening
a new mail folder window, the red arrow is where it should be, only the
sorting isn't performed! This bug is nearly as stupid as the preferences bug,
because on adding a new mail to the list, its expected position is
calculated, but not USED, it is always inserted at the end of the list.
This time a jump has to be inserted to FORCE resorting of the list.
If you apply the patch, the bug still occurs when unread mails are retrieved
from the server, they are always inserted at the beginning of the list.
Just change to a different folder and back to Inbox, then they are sorted.
<PRE>
OFFSET 15E29   74 2D -> EB 24
</PRE>
<U><A NAME=riched>Word wrap bug</A></U><BR>
In the email preferences, you can specify the maximum characters per line,
longer lines are automatically wrapped. The mail input field is a RichEdit
control, which supports wrapping automatically, but the line width must
be set in twips, which are calculated using the current screen resolution
in dpi. On all three machines I tested this on, Windows tells Opera that the
resolution is 96 dpi, while the RichEdit control seems to use 108 dpi.
Can anyone give me a hint on this?? If you experience the same problem,
that the lines are 12.5% longer than specified, use the following patch.
<PRE>
OFFSET 13FC0   75 03 6A 60 -> 90 90 6A 6C
</PRE>
<U><A NAME=javascr>Javascript variable error</A></U><BR>
There is a very annoying Javascript interpretor bug in the allocation of
global variables. If a function is called across document boundaries, e.g.
a frame child calls a function of the parent document, the latter function
cannot allocate ANY global variable!! I haven't been able to fix this up to
now.
<BR><BR>
<U><A NAME=getmail>Hangs while downloading mail</A></U><BR>
Many people also experienced this bug, but lots of others didn't.
Unfortunately I belonged to the latter, so I couldn't reproduce the bug at
first. Then I found an account per chance which showed the same error:
While retrieving mail, sometimes one or two mails were received correctly,
but then Opera invariably stopped in the middle of a mail. The mail transfer
could be aborted normally by clicking on the red x.
The error was hard to trace, but here it is:
When retrieving mail, the end of the mail body is marked by the server with
2E 0D 0A, a line containing only a single dot. Mails are always splitted
into blocks when being transmitted, and just a few mail servers send this
end marker in a seperate block, just containing these three bytes. But
Opera checks for 0A 2E 0D 0A, so the line with the single dot is only
noticed if it follows a line with other contents. If the end marker
is sent in a single block, Opera won't notice, and try to receive more mail
contents, which will never come. Once found, not too hard to patch:
<PRE>
OFFSET 1C8E4   04 -> 03
OFFSET 1C8F0   04 -> 03
OFFSET 1C8F2   DC -> DD
OFFSET 1C8F9   FC -> FD
</PRE>
<U><A NAME=attach>Attachment bug</A></U><BR>
Many people have reported problems with mail attachments. I never had any,
but based on those reports, the problem is that Opera specifies a content
boundary string like "_OPERAB__-H1HtX6bHMUjxHyf6zh47KD", and something
about that seems to be illegal. Any comments??
<BR><BR>
<U><A NAME=langde>Language file bug</A></U><BR>
I suppose this affects all language files. The language files specify
replacement strings for menu and dialog items and popup tooltips. The
numbers are identical to the internal IDs. But the programmers assigned
some IDs *twice*, so the tooltips alternate between the right and the
wrong string. You have to comment out the duplicates, which isn't so bad
because those don't have to be translated anyway!!

<U><A NAME=mailwin>Mail list window size</A></U><BR>
A mail folder window is initially divided equally into the mail list
(upper part) and the mail view (lower part). My mail list is usually short,
while the mails themselves aren't. You can move the separator up, but
this setting isn't saved. The size is calculated as follows:
<PRE>
Percentage relative to whole window = (Dword at Offset 2000C)/655.36
Example: To make the mail list have 9 entries (28% of whole window), change
OFFSET 2000C   00 80 00 00 -> 00 48 00 00
</PRE>
<U><A NAME=mailxchg>Exchanging mailbox columns</A></U><BR>
The columns can be resized, but not exchanged. This is bad because I'm
used to having the subject appear before date and size. So what?
BTW: There are quite a lot of bytes to change. The first three exchange
the labels, the next three exchange the contents, and the rest are responsible
for making the sort criteria work again.
<PRE>

OFFSET 157F7   AC -> A8
OFFSET 15841   AA -> AC
OFFSET 1588B   A8 -> AA (sort on header click)
</PRE>
<U><A NAME=mailcol>Default mailbox column size</A></U><BR>
This is more or less a bugfix, but closely related to the previous tweak,
thus listed here. You can resize the columns, the setting is saved in
COLUMNS.DAT, but not always properly loaded. So you can change the
default sizes, the values given correspond to the exchanged columns.
