My site has been ENTIRELY coded per hand using <font color=blue>[</font><a href="http://www.ultraedit.com/">ultraedit 32</a><font color=blue>]</font> version 5 (by Ian. D. Mead), 
a very advanced and versatile text editor, that you will be able to find on the web, which beats 
hands down every other text editor I have ever used. I know that Mead is <a href="http://www.ultraedit.com/">continuously updating 
it</a> and he is now 
past version "10", but I am against continuous software updates&nbsp;:-) <br>Version 5.0  
works 
perfectly well and you'll find it (or <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&q=%28uedit32.zip+OR+uedit32.rar%29&btnG=Search">any other version</a>) either on the web, or, for less than one euro, on many a 
second hand magazines' cd-roms (old version 5 appeared around the first 
semester of 1999). Alternatively you may download <font color=blue>[</font><a href="srtools.htm#text">here</a><font color=blue>]</font> 
the even older - but perfectly functional - version 3.10 of this great text editor for windoze.<br><br> 
The <font color=blue>advantages of coding per hand</font> are so evident 
to all conoisseurs that I wont even bother explain you why you should NOT use 
overbloated "frontpage-similar" applications, which would and will gladly fill your html code 
with unwanted 
crap.

There is NO ADVERTISEMENT whatsoever on this site, nor will you ever be asked to 
click on a banner, since I find all form of advertising 
vulgar and insulting, on the web and elsewhere.<br>Actually there is a whole 
<font color=blue>[</font><a href="antiadve.htm">anti-advertisement</a><font color=blue>]</font>  section 
where you'll be able, <i>inter alia</i> to learn how 
to <font color=blue>[</font><a href="remobann.htm">remove 
banners</a><font color=blue>]</font> from the so-called "free" providers. 
See:  I dislike zombies clicking on banners almost 
more than the idiots that design, publish or (try to&nbsp;:-) impose them: I 
think  that the former <u>deserve</u> the 
web-inferno they are condemned to live in. For the latter, being impossible 
- and possibly illegal - to hang them physically to their PC-towers 
with their own mouse' cables, the only hope is that they will die soon, pancaked 
by a truck, or something similar.

I know that most good knowledge sites do not 
use any images at all (there is actually a very good and sound "trend" towards 
<font color=blue>[</font><a href="http://www.sylloge.com/5k/faq.html">"almost imageless"</a><font color=blue>]</font> 
sites... mostly among the very people you should strive to browse to&nbsp;:-) yet I always enjoyed going 
<u>against</u> currents :-)<bR>Thus I have decided to have heavy slow-loading images  nevertheless 
(only for 
the main sections 
of my site), for aesthetic & didactic 
reasons that would be too long - and pompous - to 
explain here.<br>I hope that you'll excuse this small frill of mine. Consider on the other hand 
that all other essays and hint pages will load quickly.<br>Since, as you should 
know, 
images slow heavily down any form of page-loading, it 
is probably a good idea to avoid 
loading them at all, and not only if you are in a hurry or on a slow 
connection. For this purpose (and for many other good reasons) you would be 
well advised 
to use <font color=blue>[</font><a href="http://www.opera.com/index.html">OPERA</a><font color=blue>]</font> to browse 
my site.<br>Actually you would be well advised to use <font color=blue>Opera</font> to browse ANY site on 
this increasingly advertisement-polluted web.<br>Opera is a marvellous european browser, 
which is totally customizable, very powerful and <u>small</u> (vis à vis the two horrible american browsersaurii: Iexplorer and 
Netscape). Moreover it does not conceal any "snooping" code <font color=blue>[</font><a href="athei_06.htm">as opposed to 
Iexplorer</a><font color=blue>ì</font>. More! Opera  
allows you to SHUT OFF on the fly any kind of image loading (even backgrounds), 
which is an increasingly necessary option 
on this terribly commercial inflated web, in order to avoid the banner and advertisement hell I 
spoke of above. <br>Consider that for a seeker the browser is prolly his <u>main weapon</u>, 
your sword, so to speak, the tool you will use to cut deep, trough the commercial 
pudding noise, in order to find your treasure: the  
rare jewels of knowledge buried in the depth.<br>
<br>Anyway you may  use any browser you like on my sites of course, I simply don't care - nor 
check - 
if the site looks "nice" as well for those among you that still do not use Opera. Note that 
there is now a Linux version of Opera as well.<br>
Note that on the snooping web you would be well advise to 
connect any browser - ALWAYS - through
 the good ole <font color=blue>[</font><a href="zipped/proxo.zip">proxomitron</a><font color=blue>]</font> 
 (see <a href="chainin.htm">Proxomitron and Junkbuster chaining, an important lore</a> 
 and the fundamental <a href="anony_8.htm">Surfing with the Proxomitron</a>  :-)
<bR>Since getting rid 
of microsoft explorer -especially if you use windows 98- is far from being 
easy (on purpose), here you have a link to 
<font color=blue>[</font><a href="http://www.98lite.net/">http://www.98lite.net/</a><font color=blue>]</font>,
 
which will help you on this worthy endeavour. My <font color=blue>special page</font> 
<font color=blue>[</font><a href="tuttiope.htm">tutti all'opera!</a><font color=blue>]</font> could also be 
of some help on your journey towards intelligent browsing.

You are expected to have a monitor resolution of 800*600, which is the current standard. 
There are 
<font color=blue>no frames</font> on this site, nowhere. 
Of course there are  <font color=blue>neither flash nor

on my sites.
<br>I assume you are using windoze, because I am fishing in 
the pond where most fishes are, but the 
information bulk on my site 
will of course be useful for GNU/linux and mac users as well. In fact some of the advanced 
pages will be useful for you only if you use a serious operating system (i.e. GNU/Linux) and 
not a toy system like Windows.<br>There is no need for me to advice the poor readers that are still stuck 
with windoze to try <font color=blue>GNU/Linux</font> out: the battle is already over and 
GNU/Linux has already won&nbsp;:-) In fact there are so many reasons for you to move to GNU/Linux and leave 
windoze to the drooling slaves that I don't even need to list them, since you'll 
go to GNU/Linux pretty soon anyway, no matter what I or others could say. It is indeed not necessary 
to advertise GNU/Linux at all, as you'll understand by 
yourself when you'll have gathered enough knowledge, here or elsewhere. The move 
to GNU/Linux is just a <i>pons asinorum</i> (sortof) for any internaut... btw, google,

   <font size=+1>
    As you will eventually notice, this site differs <i>inter alia</i> 
    <u>graphically</u> from 
    most sites on the web.<br>This has been done on purpose. The problem is that most sites have been made with 
    ad hoc applications (golive, fontpage, dreamweaver, you name it) that, apart from 
    filling the html source code with <a href="specs.htm#how">tons of unwanted crap</a>, are 
    terribly dull and the sites created with them are 
    so similar that you 
    could call them 'zombified'. Have a look and you will notice that almost 
    all have 
    for instance  their links on the LEFT side of the screen (and/or on a navigation 
    bar on the top): "<font color=blue>See how smart: no matter what his resolution might 
    be, he'll see my links!</fonT>"&nbsp;&nbsp;
    "<font color=blue>The top and left sides in a browser window are prime real estate</fonT>" 
    and similar "guinea pig" 
    considerations: 'consistence' for lobotomized AOL-surfers with an attention span of 
    three and a half seconds :-)<br>You'll 
    also notice the attempt to 'hyperconcentrate' all messages deemed relevant for  
    visitors on the front page, thus frequently provoking an  awful 'minimal common 
    denominator' effect. Also most sites gladly bend backwards in order to AVOID 
    you 
    having the possibility to leave the premises, with links, mostly 'dull' -  at times  coded - 
    that will either open 
    inside frames or span a new window, keeping the visitors 'trapped' there, the 
    longer the better.
    <br>
    This site follow a completely different philosophy. It's up to the visitor to study 
    it's workings to take advantage of the information that is provided here. 
    You will also have plenty 
    of opportunities to leave it for intriguing paths to excellent destinations. 
    It could even happen that you wont be able to 
    find some parts of this site that are not 'on prime real estate'. 
    Many visitors may leave for ever. Good riddance, others will come: the web is a Quicksand.

As you'll discover perusing my site, there are many more sections. For security reasons 
some of them 
like the <font color=blue>[</font><a href="http://fravia.2113.ch/phplab/news.htm">PHP lab</a><font color=blue>]</font> 
 are located 
on a different 
server while some other will become accessible only 
once you yourself will 
have gathered enough searching (and hopefully <a href="tadimens.htm#ethic">ethical</a>) skills. Yes, there are indeed many pages on my site... you are not compelled to follow 
any logical path. You may peruse everything at
will, you are welcome. Do not be scared, nor paralysed if you don't understand 
everything immediately, knowledge is like one of the chill white wines
bottled in the old lagoons I come from: you should sip it slowly
and knowingly, else it won't do you no good.
