 <br><i>It's already a couple of years that "services" like rapidshare blossom on the web.

 	 proliferate like mushrooms after the rain, as this older <a href="local.htm#reposi">list</a> attest. 
 	It is quite interesting to register how offering warez for free, on the web, is nowadays developing into

 	is that allowing anyone to upload and download whatever he fancies  and at the same time <font color="#0000ff">annoying</font> as much as possible 
 	those very customers that upload and download (countdown before downloading, maximum one download per hour, slow downloading,

 	you will always find enough idiots ready to pay for the supposed 'privileged' services on offer

Recently I been downloading tons of files off web sites that offer
free file hosting services. Plus I been uploading hundreds of
various files myself then sharing the links with people who are
into the same stuff as me. It's been great fun. I find the
practice easy and rewarding; in some ways it is better than P2P
because: <ol><lI> instant gratification (so important in today's ego
driven world) I get the desired files right-a-way. </li><lI> download
begins (almost) immediately  (following a tiny 40-70 seconds wait)
AND finishes in a short time while in some cases I have had to
wait for days even weeks (yep, it's true) on P2P for a download to
start or/and complete. </li><lI> Best reason is that I find stuff that
hasn't trickled down to P2P yet. So now i want to share everything
I have learned about using file hosting web services plus to
review the ones I know. There is tons of them out there to be
sure; I can't list them all, but only will concentrate on the ones
I use and abuse the most.</lI></ol></P>


The emphasis  here will be on "free" and "easy to use". I certanly
don't want to pay anything, and I want to be able to share the
files I upload with 1. as many people as I want, and 2. as long as
I want.</P>


 Final note: all the testing described in this article on was done
on Firefox ver 1.0.1. so I didn't get any pop ups underpop ups or
whatever. I cannot guarantee  what will happen if you use AIIIIEEE, I
mean IE and I certainly  feel sorry for you if you are still using
that sorry excuse for a browser.</P>



Just as the name implies, free file hosting services such as
Rapidshare de, You-send-it, megaupload and so on will host your
files for free, but more, they will let other people download the
same files. This way instantaneous  sharing and transferring big
files on the internet becomes fairly easy and user-friendly. You
can utilize these services as your own P2P apps. If a file is too
large to send as an email attachment, just upload it to any of
these sites and email or send the link to the recipients. </P>

You can upload large files in whatever format they are; music
videos (mkv, flv, wmv, avi, mpeg, 3gp, etc), audio files, mp3,
wavs etc, songs, games, software (iso, rar, zip), cell phone ring
tones, ebooks (pdf, chm, hlp), photos, Microsoft Office documents,
CAD drawings, PDF documents, bookmarks and even retail software
installers (exe msi) files. You can make a container with a bunch
of jpegs, use Winrar to create a .rar file, password it and
uploads that rar file there too.</P>

All these services allow only single files to be sent at a time.
If you have more than one file to send, just zip them into an
archive using Winzip or any other compression utility such as
WinRar.</P><BR>

<A NAME=rapid>
<!=================>
<H2>Rapidshare</H2>
is the one I am currently using the most. I find it wonderful,
even with their waiting period of 56 minutes between files
downloads. What, you HAVE TO have it immediately?? Rapidshare is
very popular with the chan crowd -especially 4chan, and so on.
Therefore you can find fringe stuff such as comics and manga on
it, with the usual assortment of p0rn movies, mp3s, software and
even pdf files and so on.</P>

Rapidshare has many advantages. First, you do NOT need to sign
up to use their services at all. Sinmply go to their main page and
start uploading or paste the download link in your browser window,
wait 5X seconds(depends on the file size-the bigger the file the
longer the wait unfortunately) and begin downloading the file you
want. The files will stay on Rapidshare for 30 days and much
longer if they are popular. You don't have to give your friends
any special passwords of access to any folders for your shared
files.</P>

Downsides of Rapidshare:
As I mentioned several times previously, if you are not a Rapidshare
paid customer (and only morons are), you are supposed to wait about 56 minutes between each
download.  Only one download at a time from a given IP address is
allowed; unless you are using a proxy or you are paying the clowns.
Rapidshare limits each user to a certain amount MBs of downloading
per day based on the IP address. You can easily cheat
rapidshare by showing a different IP address each time you access.
If you do not want to use rotating proxies (as you should) I have found a
workway around that problem if you are on a dynamic IP (like I
am). Simply log off, and log right back on (getting a new IP in
the proccess) and you can start downloading again, heheh. Frankly I
don't see why people would prefer a torrent instead of using
Rapidshare. Some people complain their connection does not allow
them Rapishare access. You should not use a download manager if you
 use their free service, unless you really know how to trick them 
into believing you are not using it.</P>


To upload a file on Rapidshare, start from <A
HREF=ttp://ezshare.de>http://ezshare.de</A>. To upload, simply
click on the browse button there, find your file, choose the
uploading method you want (Cogent, Telia or Upload via level 3)
and presto! They don't have an upload limit so you can upload as
many files as you want one but only one at a time. The maximum
file is now 300 MB and Rapidshare will split the file into smaller
pieces for you. After your upload a file to Rapidshare de, you
will get two links. The <b>rapidshare file download-link</b>,
which you share with the people you want to give the file to, and
a delete-link, which you keep for yourself. The delete-link, when
clicked, will remove the file from rapidshare de servers. Just
like Megaupload files, rapidshare will delete files that have not
been accessed for 30 days or longer. Rapidshare premium account
supports download managers and provide much faster downloads. Note
that rapidshare happy hours service is no longer available.</P>


To download a file, simply copy and paste the download link into
your browser's window. The link will looks something like this:
<B>http://rapidshare.de/files/29243106/file-name.html</B> where
the number will be specific for your file. Scroll down to the
bottom, and you will see Premium and Free buttons. Obviously you will 
always click
on the Free one. The next screen will inform you that you
want to download a file by the name of blah blah blah and that the
file has been downloaded XX times already. A countdown will begin, 
usually between 50-80 seconds, depending on the file size.
The bigger the file, the longer the countdown. You can bypass this with 
a simple javascript nuker (see below), but it is mostly not worth it. 
When the countdown 
reaches zero, you will get a small CAPTCHA window, where you will have to
type in a 3 letter code. You will get a list of
the various servers you may download from: Cogent, Level(3)-network
or Telia-network; I usually leave it alone, but sometimes I choose
the last one because it appears to be faster for me. It is worth investigating these 
locations and URLs in order to bypass the whole bazaar.
Anyway, now you can begin downloading.</P>

If you like Rapidshare well enough to want to become a customer
their prices are at the moment around 7 EUR per month. The problem is that if you 
do sign in, they will track whatever you do with even more gusto.

<A NAME=search>
<H3>Searching Rapidshare</H3>

Rapidhshare is even searchable! You can see all the recent uploads
and you can search for specific files. Just go here: <A
HREF=http://rapidsearch.yi.org/>http://rapidsearch.yi.org/</A> and
here: <A
HREF=http://rapidsearch.yi.org/?recent=1>http://rapidsearch.yi.org
/?recent=1</A>. See the Search window at the top right corner?
Here you can do searches based on specific words. type Cool,
ey?</P>


Google can also be used to search files on Rapidshare or
Megaupload servers. The uploaded filename is contained in the
Rapidshare and megaupload URLs. This will help you find what is
posted on rapidshare/megaupload for download.

To search for ebooks and documents in PDF format on Rapidshare
type the following in the Google: <b>pdf "rapidshare.de/files"
site:rapidshare.de</b>

For movies and video files try: <B>+inurl:avi|mpg|wmv
site:rapidshare.de</b> and/or <B>avi|mpg|mpeg|wmv|rmvb
site:rapidshare.de</b>

For audio files from rapidshare: <b>+inurl:wma|mp3
site:rapidshare.de</b> and/or <b>mp3|ogg|wma
site:rapidshare.de</b>

For software, zipped files, programs from rapidshare:
<b>+inurl:exe|rar|zip site:rapidshare.de</B> 
 and/or  <b>zip|rar|exe site:rapidshare.de</b>.

full software programs on Rapidshare Search pdf files, documents,
ebooks, magazines: <b>pdf|doc|lit|rar|zip site:rapidshare.de</b>


 Replace rapidshare.de with megaupload.com to search for files
available on MegaUpload.com servers.</P>


For megaupload and rapidshare searching, narrow down you search
for what you want by putting your query at the first part. Say if
you want to search for da vinco code ebook use the query: <b>da
vinci code pdf|doc|lit|rar|zip site:rapidshare.de</b>. Say if you
want to search for Ministry mp3 files and music videos use the
query <b>Ministry mp3|wmv site:rapidshare.de</b></P>

<A HREF="http://rapidshared.org/">RapidShared.org</A> is an online
catalog of uploaded stuff on Rapidshare. They got it separated by
this categories:  e-Books, Games, Graphics,  Magazines,  Mobile
Videos,  Music,  Other, Software,  Videos and XXX videos even
listing the total numbers of each.  You can preview diff stuff
from Rapidshared, rate it, review it, bookmark it(huh?) or simply
download it by clicking on the "visit this link".
Rapidshared got a Search option there but it did not appear to be
working  when i tested it. It didn't list ANY finds for
files I already KNEW were on rapidshare.</P>  




<A NAME=tricks>
<H3>Rapidshare hacks Tips &amp; Tricks:</H3>

How to disable the rapidshare.de download counter in IE or
Firefox.  While waiting for download, type <b>
javascript:c(countdown = 0);</b> in the browser addressbar to
eliminate the rapidshare countdown (waiting) feature. (this might
not work all the time).



Open the Megaupload or Rapidsare URL of the application, movie,
software or whatever you have to download. >Click on Free and not
the Premium Button. The counter is right on the bottom. Go to the
URL on top, and in the address bar write
<B>javascript:alert(c=1)</B>. You should be able to download
without no timer. If the above doesnt work try for megaupload
unlimited download<B>javascript:alert(x=1);</B>.</p>

for cable or dsl just turn off ur modem. wait for 10 secs, then
turn it back on. the modem should have assigned u a new ip  --for
dial up just disconnect and reconnect. works every time :)</P>

<H3>Security and privacy</H3> on Rapidshare is not something I
have extensively tested, so i cannot talk about it much. I haven't
tried to upload a file using a proxy; it would take forever, plus
proxies willing to let you use POST are getting rarer than a free
usenet server. If you want, you can certanly file protect your
uploads by passwording them, but one peculiarity of both WinRAR
and Winzip is even passworded files' contents will be displayed
when you try to open them; therefore all the individul file names
will be seen. WinRAR gives you the option to hide the file names
however. What's worse, the searchable link from rapidsearch will
display the password to your file when it lists it in their most
recent.</P>

<A NAME=zshare>

<!==================================>
<H2>zShare</H2>
is yet another company offering file hosting for free. They are
not as well known as Rapidshare or Megaupload, yet they are good.
No registration is required at all. The file size is limited to
100 Mbs only, which is a bit low these dayz but hey that's not
bad. Porn is not allowed to be uploaded.</P>
Uploading is as easy as Rapidshare. You got your Browse button for
find the file. To upload you must check in and agree to their TOS
then click on the Share it button. You will get a page showing you
the progress of the transfer. Once the file has been uploaded, you
will get 3 links: a download Link, Link for forums and Direct
Link. You will also be told To receive all the info on the file
you uploaded, such as removal instructions and download link,
enter your e-mail address on the field below:. Plus you will get
the 4 email addrewsses.</P>

 Downloading is very easy too. Just paste or type the link in your
borwser window and all you ill have to do is clikc on the Download
now link that got the big Green arrow pointing downward. Click on
it and you will be told your download will begin shortly.</P>	


Their main page is at <A
HREF=http://www.zshare.net>http://www.zshare.net</a></P>
<BR>



<!==================================>
<H2>SaveFile</H2>
is another file hosting service. Unfortunatly, the file size limit
is only 60 Mbs. After uploading you will be given a link, that
others will use to download your file. each file can be downloaded
unlimited times. The files stay on the server for 30 days.
Savefile is completly free to use. Theirnmain page is at <A

<BR>




<A NAME=mega>
<!==================================>
<H2>Megaupload</H2> is another very popular one because they are
hosting thousands of files.</P>

The good sides of Megaupload:
No registration is required. File Size Limit is now 250 MB, but it
used to be 500 Mbs. Your uploaded files will be deleted only after
it become unused for 30 days. So, if many of your friends download
it, over and over again, the files will always be there. The
Megaupload site allows only one download at a time from a IP
address. The site blocks more attempts than that.</P>

Downsides of Megaupload:
Their site does not render correctly with Firefox ver 1.0.1; I
couldn't fill in the required file description because I couldnt
find where to click exactly. I was forced to use IE and that didnt
make me happy at all. Then IE informed me I needed an Active X
controlled installed. So I did that. Finally I was able to start
uploading my test file. The upload was fairly s-l-o-w sor such a
small 71 Kb file. Just as with Rapidshare I got a small link
pointing to the address of my uploaded file. The link will be
something like this: <B>http://www.megaupload.com/?d=R5HT3PQG</B>


They got an annoying sounds assigned to the mouse movement so turn
down your speakers when you will be using them.</P>

Uploading is not as easy as on Rapidshare. They require a
descroption of the file when uploading something.</P>

Their prices are as follows:
<PRE>
1 month premium membership  	$ 9.99  	
6 months premium membership 	$ 39.99 	
1 year premium membership 	$ 59.99 	
Lifetime platinum membership 	$ 99.99 </PRE></P>

Megaupload is also searchable via Google. Try this string for
movies: <B>avi|mpg|mpeg|wmv|rmvb site:megaupload.com</B> 
Search for Software, Warez, ISO Programs on MegaUpload:
<B>zip|rar|exe site:megaupload.com</b> Search ebooks and magazine
on megaupload: <B>pdf|rar|zip|doc|lit site:megaupload.com</b>.</P>

<A HREF="http://www.megauploaded.org/">MegaUploaded.ORG</A> is a
catalog of materials hosted on Megaupload. It was down as of this
writing and I will try testing it in a few days again.</P>

<A NAME=you>
<!==================================>
<H2>YouSendIt</H2>
is a somewhat different type of a file hosting web service; when
you send a file via the YouSendIt Web site, an e-mail goes to your
recipient with a link to your file, which is stored securely on
YouSendIt's server. You only have to enter a To email address; you
are not required to enter a From address. You can also enter an
optional message.</P>  

Advantiges: You can upload up to 1 gig filer(but the wait is a bit
long, hehe). YouSendIt can send files in two ways: normal (where
each server can view it) and securely (https), plus it scans files
for viruses. No registration is required.</P>

Disadvantiges: The file will stay there for seven days or until it
is downloaded 25 times, whichever comes first.</P>

Uploading is easy and fast because their inerface is clean and
easy to use. Fill in the recipient email address, add a messaage
to the recipient (optional), click on the Browse link to find your
file, trhen clikc on the blue Send it button. You will get a
message telling you: Do no close this page untill the upload is
complete. If the upload is successful, you will get File
successfully sent! messaage.</P>


<H3>Yousendit Hacks</H3>  To disable the Yousendit 25 downloads
limit follow this ptocedure: When a file is uploaded to yousendit,
it displays a link to your file when the upload process is
complete. The link generally looks like this: <b>
http://s8.yousend...83E2C899DB721</B>. Append http://anonym.to/?
to the above yousendit link, the new URL should now look like:
<b>http://anonym.to/?http://s8.yousend...83E2C899DB721</b>
Load the URL in your browser and download should begin. This trick
will not by pass the seven day limit.</P>

Create unlimited downloads from Yousendit The YouSendIt link looks
:<b>http://s12.yousendit.com/d.aspx?id=46FK4...82KLDFS78D</b> See
the letter "d" after "yousendit.com/" ? Change that letter "d" to
an "e" and the link will never die. The d.aspx has the counter on.
Ff it finds there has been more than 25 hits then it refers the
user to expired.aspx otherwise it refers you to e.aspx. e.aspx has
the download link and does not add any more hits. the link may
stay for longer but will not eliminate the 7 day period</P>

You can use most download managers when downloading files from

 is a online tool (with desktop component) that lets you e-mail
large files upto 1 GB you wouldn&rsquo;t normally be able to send
via e-mail. It&rsquo;s free to try and can be used via Mac or Win
machines</P><span style="font-weight: bold;">Bigupload</span><br
/>No signup is required.Bigupload lets you send files upto 2000MB.
If nobody downloads your file for 30 days, it is automatically
deleted. Progress bar to show how much is uploaded. Can be
integrated with MySpace.  45 seconds wait for download.</P>

<H2>Oxyshare</H2> is one more file hosting service I tried.
Disadvantiges: they require you sign up with them to use them. But
signin up is very easy and fast. All you need to do is give them a
name, a password and a working email address where they can send
you a validation code. They are at:
<a href="https://searchlores.nickifaulk.com/www.oxyshare.com">www.oxyshare.com</A>.</P>
<BR>
<!==================================>
<H2>spread-it.com</H2>
is another file hosting service. They allow files with up to 500
Mbs size. They require valid email address, valid recipient emailm
address (up to  2 diff recipioents). There is no registration and
no fees. There is nothing to install and no special software
required. All you need is the browser you are using right now.
They will host your file for 14 days, without downloads limit or
waiting times. Their main page is at <A
HREF=http://www.spread-it.com>http://www.spread-it.com</A>.</P>

Uploading is not as easy and free as rapidshare. They require the
following for an upload: Password to delete your file, Description
of the file and an email address.  As a test, I filled in
"fuckoff2" for all 3 three fields and tried to upload a file and
it did go through! I did get a download link and was able to get a
copy of the file.</P>

This article is far from complete or finished or the definite last
word on web hosting services. Additions, corrections, etc are
needed and will be added. I can be contacted at hoyeru00(that's

  <H1>A small addition by Stilgar</H1>
  (Mid September 2006)<br><bR>
  An addition for filehosting.htm, by Hoyeru. <br>
  If somebody, 
  when using Megaupload.com, receive the boring message: 
  "<i>All download slots (3000) assigned to your country</i> (your-country-name-here) <i>are in use</i>", find a proxy located in another country and feed the link. The page will load with the link for the archive, 
  that could then be copied for another window of browser and the download will work.

  <H1>A small addition by Eevon</H1>
  (December 2007)<br><bR>
  Hi.
<br>
  
  About downloading from Megaupload.com. As Stilgar mentioned you can
  often get "All download slots (3000) assigned to your country
  (your-country-name-here) are in use" message when trying to download
  something. Well, in my case (i'm living in Russia) i get this message always.<br>
  Megaupload suggest to install it's 'toolbar' for IE to eliminate such
  limitation. It really removes this limit, but no one wants to use IE with this creepy
  toolbar and it's ADs. Hoyeru suggests to use a proxy of another country,
  but chances are that it's slots could be "in use" too. There is an easy way
  to fix that problem. All that we need is to give to Megaupload.com correct User-Agent
  string of it's own beloved toolbar and it's cookie. Just add two new entries in
  Proxomitron's list of HTTP Header Filters:<br><br>

  HTTP Header:<br>
  User-Agent: Megaupload Toolbar<br>
  URL Match:<br>
  www.megaupload.com<br>
  Header Value Match<br>
  *<br>
  Replacement text:<br>
  Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; MEGAUPLOAD 2.0)<br><br>

  HTTP Header:<br>
  Cookie: Fake Megaupload Toolbar's cookie (out)<br>
  URL Match:<br>
  www.megaupload.com<br>
  Header Value Match<br>
  *<br>
  Replacement text:<br>
  toolbar=1; l=ru; MUTBI=E%3D3%2CP%3D3; v=1; megauploadtoolbar_id=2BF7627DC8A947ACBB6A6D9CF6950C8C; megauploadtoolbar_visible=yes
<br><br>
  Now we always have "unlimited slots" in any browser everywhere in the world.
<br><br>
  I hope you'll find this information useful: I didn't invented this method myself. I've found it elsewhere in the net
  and just modified it to use updated User-Agent string and a cookie which was
  added by Megaupload recently.
