   <font size=+2><u>Homepages and <font color=blue>Email one-shot providers</font> and 'light' anonymity for your stuff</u></font>
<br><br>
<i>It's simply amazing how many possibilities you have to create "one-shot" email addresses with 
     huge repositories where you can upload, share and download QUICKLY whatever you fancy. For these very reasons, on these places  you 
     can also, often enough, find some very juicy targets&nbsp;-)<br><br> 
     
             
             Of course, for "survavibility" reasons, you should use some tricks for your files. Especially in 
             copyright obsessed countries, or if you are not politically correct vis-à-vis your current dictature.
             <br>
             A simple one is what I like to call the "zar" compression method (zip+ace+rar): You zip (and password protect), then ace 
             (and password protect), then rar (and password protect) your file. Or chose 
             any other sequence of the various packers, for instance first zip (then stegano into a -say- wav file), then ace the result (then 
             stegano into a -say- rm file), then, again, rar the result (then stegano again into -say- a (huge) pdf file)... you 
             get the hang of it... You decide the sequences.
             <br><br>You'll automate the process of course, a simple batch file will be enough.<br>
             <br>
             Then, once done, you change the name of your resulting file 
             to -say- a <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~ritter/tiff/">tiff</a> format (even if it is no tiff file, who cares?&nbsp;:-) 
             and up it goes! Better if splitted into many (at least two) parts. 
             Noone/nobot will really try to see/reconstruct the image, they will think, at worse, it is some kind of corrupted file, 
              especially if you call it in your email subject 
             something like "tiff with x rays of my 
             last shoulder fracture": they wont be so easily able to 
             sniff your real data either, unless they have really *a lot of time* and are really after you&nbsp;:-).
             <br><br>
             Once your friends download the file, they will go all the steps you chose in reverse (with a batch file), and that's it.
             <br><br>
             Phone them the password(s) for some added (light) anonimity.
     <br><br>Here a short list of 1 (or more) giga providers, and then also a webbit to find more...</i>

      <br><br>
      <font color=blue>Anonymity must know</font><br>
      Of course when you sign up for these services you should <b><u>NEVER</u></b> give them <font color=blue>your real data</font>. 
      <br>Lie to them a-plenty without shame, 
      like  there were no tomorrow... coz there'isnt one&nbsp;:-)<br>But in order to "build" a credible lie, you need some real data.
      And there are <a href="droptableifexists.txt">plenty of personal data</a> around if you use the right <a href="rabbits.htm">webbit</a> 
      <br>
      Just take a book from your library... here for instance, behind me, <font color=blue>Bill Rosenblatt, Learning the Korn Shell, O'Reilly,
      103 Morris Street, Suite A, Sebastopol, California 95472</font>. Such data are more than enough 
      to "get signed" anywhere as, for instance, "Rose Billenblatt", 03 Morris Street, Suite B, Sebastopol, CA 95472, USA. 
      A very credible, solid address.<br> 
      Should you have to answer any further question when signing up for a "free" email address (your profession, your level of income...)   just choose either the FIRST option of the 
      proposed alternatives ("account", "over 10 million bucks per month") or select "other" so that they will add even more 
      crap to their lists&nbsp;:-)<br> Point to remember: <font color=blue>on the web you NEVER give away your true identity</font>. 
      <br><br>
      Do not feel bad while laying your gut out of yourself: the very reason they HAVE such "free" email addresses sites is -of course- to READ 
      everything you write and to have a copy of everything you upload or create. Imagine you have yahoo and notice that 2 thousands (or hundred)
       
      bozos are going to advice their friend to sell tomorrow  the action of pepsi cola... insider trading is NOTHING in comparison with 
      the insider data you can have sniffing emails and search queries on the <a href="main.htm">main</a> search engines... or why did you think you 
      have "free" search engines in the first places? Coz yahoo and google owners are nice people that want to help you 
      finding stuff on the web? Nope. The real reason is obvious:  in order to know what people are searching for, duh.  
      That's the reason you should always strive to give them as few data as you can. It's like the supermarket "fidelity cards": they 
      just want to stuff their databases for next to free in order to know how much you cry/shit/sleep/ and make love. To spend less and
      gain more, not to give you "discounts". 
 
      <br><br>
      A last point: the list of free email accounts above is of course NOT exhaustive. To fetch MANY more you just build your own 
      webbit ad hoc:<br> <a href="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=walla+rediff+unitedemailsystems&num=10&hl=en&btnG=Google+Search&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&lr=&as_ft=i&as_filetype=&as_qdr=all&as_nlo=&as_nhi=&as_occt=any&as_dt=i&as_sitesearch=&safe=images">walla rediff unitedemailsystems</a>
      <br><br>
      Of course, for email providers, as for everything else, there are     ad hoc communities and specific 
      <a href="http://www.emailaddresses.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?forumid=8">messageboards</a>
      <br><br>
      There are also MANY providers that will give you limited accounts (as many as you want, but they'll die after -say- 30 days, 
      for instance <a href="http://4806.runbox.com/">runbox</a>...)
      <br>
      Such accounts are IDEAL for quick transfer of files between friends (Runbox: 1 GB email storage  ~ 
100 MB file storage ~
30 MB message size limit, 30 days limit).<br>Accounts that are nuked after a given number of days 
are <font color=blue>even better</font>, in  "twilight" cases&nbsp;:-)  
vis-à-vis accounts that remain for ever, even when you have forgotten having used them&nbsp;:-) <br><br>
Yet please note that, in order to offer 1 gigabyte throw-away email addresses for free, you need to be able to offer a SIGNIFICANT server 
configuration, which is rare as you may think, and -hence- that most of the "small" 1-giga email repositories are -mostly- just scam that <font color=blue>does not work</font>, 
so, if you want to be "sure and pampered" stick with the known working ones: walla, yahoo (& yahoo china) gmx, and rediff.

   <b>file thingies</b><br><br>
you of course already knew:
<br>
<ul><li>http://www.yousendit.com - upload a file up to 1GB, in fact there's no need
<br>to enter any email-address, just choose a file, and send it. you will get a
<br>link to the file on the yousendit server, which you can post/mail/drop wherever
<br>you like.
<br>
<br>similar services:
<br>
<br><li>http://www.peer2mail.com/ - splits up a large file and mails it to any free <a target=_top href="http://searchlores.org/freemail.htm">large webmail account</a>, then use this tool again to merge the files. 's nice cause gmail has a 10mb attachment limit (or so i heard, didn't try), in fact i didn't try this tool.
<br>
<br><li>http://www.dropload.com/ - same kind of service as yousendit, except you need <a target=_top href="http://www.bugmenot.com">to register a login</a> and you wont get a link to your file, the link will only be shown in the <a target=_top href="http://www.mailinator.com">email-address</a> you send something to. also didn't try it, but it seems okay.
</ul>
<br>(..) trying to find more similar things, but failed. the web got big :)
<br>if anyone else has related interesting online tools, i'd love to hear about
<br>it&#33;

perhaps this is slightly off topic, but you can upload files here
<br>
<br>jar:http://www.anisolution.com/members/~monkeya/misc/fm/filemanager.jar&#33;/filemanager.xul
<br>
<br>requires firefox
<br>
<br>the front end GUI is out of this world and downloadable should you wish to start your own service - i found it interesting as it demonstates an example of next generation web pages
