windows computer without any money at all</font></center></td></tr></table>
<br></center> 


Let's imagine you have a brand-new PC with windoze on it. I'm not saying you 
SHOULD have a windoze PC, I'm just assuming you have, probably just because almost everybody else around you 
has, or because there was no other operating system choice in the shop you bought it: <i>Praeterita mutare non possumus</i>: 
our societies are  a monopoly 
of the worst, let's face it.<br><br>I am not going to  even try 
to push you onto the worthy <a href="http://www.gnu.org/home.html">GNU</a>/<a href="linux.htm">Linux</a> path... mostly because it 
is actually NOT necessary in my experience: you'll choose it by yourself  - and ditch  the 
windows operating system with gusto <a href="linux.htm">later</a> - once 
you will 
have understood some basic lore&nbsp;:-)<br><br>Linux is free, blah blah,  all its software is free, blah blah, 
and it's more stable and quicker than 
windows, blah blah... yet for the moment you are still using Windows. And you do not intend (yet) to <a href="linux.htm">change</a>.<br> 
Well... So what? Why should you pay any money at 
all? Windows  <font color=blue>can</font> be fully configured with good free 
"<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GPL</a>" software (or other -less kosher- free software) that 
will cut pretty much any mustard.
<br><br>
Now, understand it correctly,  <a href="http://www.fsf.org/licensing/essays/free-sw.html">really free software</a> 
 is a matter of the users' freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software, but the
idea behind this page is to help anybody  to prepare a windozian computer on the fly, 
for free like in "free beer", ready for any occurrence 
(and then some) he may run into, on his job, on the web 
or elsewhere&nbsp;:-)<br><br> This page is <i>in fieri</i>, please excuse its obvious shortcomings.<br>La va sans dire that after having taken advantage of this page your windoze computer (your box) will be 
- for free!- one of the 
best ones around your neighbourhood, in a radio of at least 25 kilometers&nbsp;:-)<br><br>
And this, <i>nota bene</i> will happen independently of where you happen to live. This will work both in London and in Kathmandu, both in 
New York or in the Kamchatka peninsula... You may be as rich as a Cameroonian or as poor as a Norwegian, it would not matter 
at all: everything, on the web, is for FREE.<br>

The nice thing of our web is that you <font color=blue>do not need any more</font> 
to be near a huge university or library in order to enjoy exactly the same amount of 
knowledge that you would get in Oxford or in Berlin. Provided you know <a href="http://www.searchlores.org/index.html">how 
to search the web</a>, that is. <br>
<br>As a matter of fact I wrote this page for a good friend of mine that is responsible of a small 
school in Rhodesia (I know that Rhodesia has now another, different, name, but I tend to remember nice names 
for places that -once upon a time- were nice&nbsp;:-)<br>
This friend is a teacher (one of the last in that wrecked country) and 
his (black and white) pupils have at the moment just two 
battered windoze computers and no money whatsoever for software.
<br><br>
 Thus  this page will offer a completely LEGAL "<font color=blue>free-software</font>" approach in order to set up  
 a full-fledged, powerful, windoze box for free.<br>Actually, mind you, I have nothing against "illegal" approaches 
 on the web, not least
  because of their creativity, 
 cleverness, shrewdness and teaching power.<br>However, since I firmly believe (la va sans re-dire&nbsp;:-)   
 that the <font color=blue>completely legal</font> "<a href="http://www.gnu.org/home.html">GNU</a>" 
 approach of my <a href="photos.htm#richard">friend</a> Richard Stallman is the correct one and the one any seeker should 
 follow,  it is very likely that this page should be -still- quite useful. In fact here we 
  will list the best windozian software applications that anyone can fetch  
 for free. Yep, you heard it: <font color=blue>free</font>, like in <font color=blue>free beer</font> (not only like in free speech&nbsp;:-)<br>It will cost you
  Nil, nada, nichts, niente, gratis, rien... <font color=blue>nothing 
 to pay</font>, never...  
 most free applications -moreover- are delivered with a <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GPL</a>  
 license (copyleft), <u>and with 
 the respective complete source code</u> (do not ever forget that <font color=blue>published & public</font> source code is 
 what anyone needs   
 to avoid <a href="malware.htm">malwares</a> and spywares: no source code available = something fishy).<br><br>So this page  
 should -after all- be quite useful not only for my friend in Rhodesia and  
 his pupils, but also for many other readers of <a href="http://www.searchlores.org">searchlores</a> (and for myself when setting up 
 some PCs in the middle of nowhere&nbsp;:-)

Ok, admittedly: windows is a can of worms ... but sadly on this world things that do not work very well, nor 
make much sense, are still used intensively (private cars, cigarettes, lawyers and wars... to name just a few). 
So windows is here unfortunately, and - 
the mighty spreading of better operating systems (like <a href="http://www.gnu.org/home.html">GNU</a>-<a href="linux.htm">Linux</a>) notwithstanding - 
 it is here to stay for a while. (Though maybe the recent "Vista" crapola will be windows' grave: people 
 are galooping to Mac/Os and powerful recent versions of <a href="linux.htm">Linux</a>).<br><br>
So I will assume that you have a windows operating system, most probably one of those 
Windows XP  editions (if you are unfortunate enough to run "Vista" you'r beyond good sense) 
known for cumbersome & slow functioning and for their customary delivering to Microsoft even 
what you are searching on your hard disk trough    the 
start/search function. 
<br>No kidding: Try it, and check what's going on with a good firewall: any search on your own harddisk trough MS <font color=blue>start-->search</font>
 will trigger 
a hidden connection trough port 80 to sa.windows.com (207.46.248.249). Why? 
Well, simply in order to deliver to microsoft's spymasters both <font color=blue>your IP</font> and <font color=blue>what you are searching for</font>... 
on your own hard disk.

<br><br> 

Well ok, once again: you have windows as an operating system. A poor choice if you ask me, but life is often a 
matter of compromises. So you have it, and you now need some programs. You "need" Word, you "need" Excel, etcetera. Well, so what? 
Do you have to pay something? Do you have to give money to Microsoft?<br>
The answer is NO!<br>I know that many readers wont believe it, but still:  The answer is NO! You can have everything 
(and then some) 
for free and in a perfect legal manner! Well, not exactly "word" and not exactly "excel"... but -lo and behold- the same only 
MUCH BETTER!

Let's begin from the beginning. &nbsp;&nbsp; 
For a good, complete, useful, working box you (usually) need:<font size=+2>

<br><br>...and all possible <a href="bangla.htm#uniani">university courses for anyone</a>, and more...
</li><hr width=44% align=left>
</ol><br></font><br>
Again, we want programs that are <font color=blue>completely free</font>, no strings attached, 
without spyware and we want programs capable of delivering 
high performance (not awkward grindings of the system à la MS-word&nbsp;:-)
<br>
<br>
As you'll see, using <a href="http://www.gnu.org/home.html">GNU</a>-license applications and/or open source programs or "freeware" programs 
this list can be filled quite quickly&nbsp;:-)
<br>
<br>  
It must be noted that
some of the software choices listed below... (highly personal, your suggestions & critics are welcome) 
... are not really kosher, because they are not <a href="http://www.gnu.org/home.html">GNU</a>-applications.<br><br>
This is, for instance the case of IDA, the best disassembler on this planet (and if you do not know why you should 
need a disassembler you still have a lot to learn).
<br>
<br> 
The purpose of this page, though, is just to offer the best applications that you can have for free... note also that even on this 
very site there are MANY MORE 
useful programs and applications that you can download from both my <a href="tools.htm">tools</a> and 
my <a href="srtools.htm">software reversing tools</a> pages: this is just a basic "fundamental" choice.
<br>
<br>
<font color=blue>The good news</font>: this will cost you (and my friend in Rhodesia) no money at all, wherever you are.<br>
<font color=blue>The bad news</font>: some people will believe you are a wizard and shy away from your box, ashamed of having 
paid money for crappish & less performing software.<br>
<font color=blue>The worse news</font>: this list is incomplete and can and should (and pheraps will &nbsp;:-) be 
ameliorated. I hope that my readers will 
realize how important this "snowball of ours" could be: how far it could go down our webhills, and 
therefore send their feedbacks, suggestions, additions, comments  
and critics. 
<br>
<br><font size=+2>
Ok, here we (legally) boldly go where very fews went before: let's (legally) open windows black and blue. Yo may as well reformat everything and start 
again with a clean windoze box, say "good riddance" to all that crap they installed when you bought it&nbsp;:-)
<br>
<br>
 Your box should have:
<br></font>
<ol>
<li><a name="wordo"></a>
     A wordprocessor<br> Openoffice<br>   
     <a href="http://download.openoffice.org/">http://download.openoffice.org/</a>: OpenOffice.org Downloads. Now version 2.0!
     Beats M$-Word hands down for smaller footprint, less intrusive behaviour and <a href="pdffing.htm#ashok">pdf-creating</a>
      capacities. Hasn't got ALL the functions in Word, but 
     noone has even met any human being that really uses them.<br>"<font color=blue>Hey, it works just like MS Office but it's free!</font>"<br><br> 
         
          Alternatively: <a href="http://www.abisource.com/">Abiword</a>, Open source project, have a look at its 
          <a href="http://www.abisource.com/tour/">capabilities</a>&nbsp;:-)<br>
          Runs on any operating system and has the ability to run  in many languages. 
          <br>AbiWord is very small and requires very little resources to run, you'll prolly  
          never go back to that bloated and crash-prone M$-word again&nbsp;:-)<br>

      <a name="htmledit"></a>    
           <br><br><b>A html editor as well...</b><br>   
                   Of course if you are serious about writing HTML code you need an <i>ad hoc</i> editor. Most 
                   searchers use <a href="http://www.ultraedit.com/">ultraedit</a> (there is a very <a href="zipped/uedit310.zip">old 
                   version</a> that you can download from my own 
                   <a href="srtools.htm">srtools.htm</a> page, and -as usual- all newer 'stolen' 
                   versions are <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&hl=en&lr=&safe=off&q=CHZHY.126+ultraedit&btnG=Search">very easy 
                   to find</a> all over the web),  Ian Mead, the author of Ultraedit, may be religiously completely balooney (see <a href="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=%22This+is+our+testimony+of+God%27s+direction%2C+guidance+and+provision+for+us+over+the+last+year%22&num=10&hl=en&btnG=Google+Search&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&lr=&as_ft=i&as_filetype=&as_qdr=all&as_nlo=&as_nhi=&as_occt=any&as_dt=i&as_sitesearch=&safe=images">his

                   and many of the functions that Ultraedit incorporates are completely missing in Micro$oft's <font color=blue>Wordsaurius</font>.<br>
                   Yet, once 
                   again, this is a page for good FREEWARE, so use <a href="http://www.arachnoid.com/arachnophilia/">arachnophilia</a> 
                   instead of Ultraedit, and you will have a POWERFUL freeware HTML (& much more) editor, designed by Paul Lutus, 
                   an older one that will also explain you once for all what <a href="http://www.arachnoid.com/freeware/index.html">freeware</a> is (or rather should 
                   be) about.

In bangla.htm the only all-purpose editor is UltraEdit (not-free), and
I think you should add some free editors
like EMACS and VIM.  As you know, they are POWER-USER tools, free, and
multiplatform, so when changing OS, one doesn't have to learn new
tools ;).<br>


EMACS download and info page : <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html">http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html</a><br>
VIM download and info page : <a href="http://www.vim.org">http://www.vim.org</a>
<br>
Of course, these two tools need to be learnt in order to power-use them<br><br>
Kane: Perhaps as a ultraedit replacement: <a href="http://www.pspad.com/en/">http://www.pspad.com/en/</a>
<br><br>
oxo: I used <a href="http://www.pspad.com/en/">pspad</a>, before switching to my now preferred environment: 
<a href="http://www.jedit.org">http://www.jedit.org</a> (see below: kasimir's suggestion)<br><br>
Sminky: I used <a href="https://searchlores.nickifaulk.com/www.jedit.org">Jedit</a> for a long time, if you are a java fan it is a good editor. 
The only complaint I have is on slower machines (like mine) because it run in java it is slow. 
On the plus side it is possible to make plugin for it. <br>

Right now I use <a href="http://drpython.sourceforge.net/">DrPython</a> which is theoretically a python editor. But because it use the scitilla 
text widget it can have sytax highlight for other languages. Also it has a scripting/plugin system which is very simple.<br> 

On the downside <a href="http://drpython.sourceforge.net/">DrPython</a> is a little ruff arround the edges, it is not as well polished as <a href="https://searchlores.nickifaulk.com/www.jedit.org">jedit</a>. 
<br>
<a href="https://searchlores.nickifaulk.com/www.jedit.org">Jedit</a> and <a href="http://drpython.sourceforge.net/">DrPython</a> are both cross platform which I think is important.<br><br>

Like arachnophilia, jEdit is Java software. jEdit just recently won EditPad, which was fairly remarkable thing to do, 
considering that many thought EditPad was the best editor there was. 
<br>

One of the best features of jEdit is its incredible extensibility and configurability, which allows you 
to tailor it exactly to your liking - admittedly something a novice user might find daunting.

     Unfortunately for databases things are different. Alas, most free "office" suites still lag behind M$-Office (or Corel) for their  database component

     Alternatively a school may even decide to use an older database: <font color=blue>Paradox for windows 4.5</font>.

     quite useful database that was written for windows 95 yet runs 
     perfectly in windoze XP. Moreover there is a wealth of very good paradox programming book in any second 
     hand book shop that are as cheap as it gets, since almost nobody in his 
     right mind would buy them today. 
      Paradox 4.5 has been given out by 
     Borland in its full commercial version almost 10 years ago (on the british magazine 
     <a href="http://www.pcplus.co.uk/">PcPlus n°15</a>: <a href="zipped/PARADOX.rar">6.498.087 bytes</a>...

     inside the C:\PDOXWIN subdirectory. 
     This is quicker than choosing the correct subdirectories within the ad hoc initial screen).

Just to let you know that PostgreSQL 8.02 is now
natively available for windows
(<a href="http://www.postgresql.org/ftp/">http://www.postgresql.org/ftp/</a>). I'm not that
familiar with MaxDB, but Postgresql is definitely a
better database (in terms of functionality) than the
old MySQL. Another database that might be worthwhile
is Firebird (Opensource version of
Interbase)(<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/firebird">http://sourceforge.net/projects/firebird</a>).
Both of these could give some real competition to any
commercial DB system (excluding Oracle for some really
high-powered enterprise systems).

Agent Ransack is a tool for finding files and information on your hard drive fast and efficiently. 
When searching the contents of files Agent Ransack also displays the text found. 
Users can then quickly browse the results without having to separately open each file.<br>
The regular expression '<font color=blue>search</font>' would match any string containing 'search'. 
<br>So if you wanted to find a file with the letters '<font color=blue>teoma</font>' in it the regular expression would simply be 'teoma'.
<br>
To find a file that <u>begins</u> with 'Dear' or 'Yesterday' followed at some point by 'Document' or 'Documents' 
followed at some point by a number and <u>has</u> a '.txt' 
extension the expression would be: '<font color=blue>^(Dear|Yesterday).*Documents?.*[0-9]+.*\.txt$</font>'  <br>
You can test your regular expressions, before searching, through an <i>ad hoc</i> Test->Regular expression menu option

    <br>Note that this is a Disk at once program: The commonly used track-at-once (TAO) mode writes each track independently which requires link blocks between 
    two tracks. <br>Older CD-recorder models forced a two second pause (pre-gap) between two tracks whereas 
    newer models allow adjusting of the pause length in TAO mode reducing the number of link blocks to a minimal amount.<br>
     However, with TAO it is generally not possible to define the data that is written in pre-gaps.<br> But exactly 
     this feature makes audio CD recording interesting, e.g. by creating hidden bonus tracks or track intros in 
     pre-gaps like it is common habit on commercial CDs.<br>  
Finally, DAO recording is the only way to write data to the unused R-W sub-channels for 
e.g.  CD-G or CD-TEXT.

"<i>After a close friend of mine paid an outrageous amount of money for DVD decrypting/burning software only 
to find out it was limited in what DVD's it would decrypt and burn and showing him what tools 
he could download for free to get the job done, I wondered how many other people 
paid for expensive software only to find out it was limited in what it would do?  
There are many free (and a couple open source) fantastic software packages 
do get the job done with that don't care what kind of DVD you feed it.  There may be legal 
ramifications with directly linking to them, but they are all trivial to find on google with 
one-word searches</i>" <br>(David, October 2005)<br>

  <a href="http://www.dvdshrink.org">Dvdshrink</a>  is no longer in active development and hasn't been for quite some time 
  (before DVD Decryptor quit dev), unfortunately there is no decent 
  freeware solution to what it does so it needs help. DVD Decryptor 
  as noted is also discontinued, which makes it pretty much bunk as they're still making new copy protections. <br><br> 

DVDFab is still in production and is a cut down 
version of a commercial product <a href="http://www.dvdidle.com/free.htm">http://www.dvdidle.com/free.htm</a> but 
will strip off all protections as far as I know. <a href="http://www.dvd43.com/">http://www.dvd43.com/</a> is also 
a solution but doesn't play nice with 9x systems. <br><br>

<br><br>

Sooooooo, use the DVDFab software to rip the DVD 
to your drive, run it through DVDShrink if it's a DVD9 to get it to a DVD5, 
then point ImgTool Classic at the shrinked dir to make it back into an ISO and burn 
off with your favourite recording tool :)<br>

       How does Codeseeker work ? It intercepts all your Internet traffic by applying a set of safety rules, either those predefined, or those defined by the user. Then, it controls internet programs and blocks undesired connections. Moreover in the event of an attack occurrence, CodeSeeker informs the user through the administration console.

The target of this software is to be able to stop any type of attack, even those unknown, with the help of "connectors" installed on the Web server, which will analyze traffic and will work appropriately.

Although a detailed explanation (installation and operation) is provided in PDF format, included in the software 
(in English), this software is recommended for the experienced user. <br><br><b><a href="http://www.zonelabs.com/store/content/catalog/products/sku_list_za.jsp">Zonealarm</a></b><br>
"ZoneAlarm is free for individual and not-for-profit charitable entity use (excluding governmental entities and educational

Intrusion Blocking systematically identifies hackers and blocks access attempts.
Stealth Mode automatically makes your computer invisible to anyone on the Internet." <br><br>

You have probably heard of ClamWin, the OS virus scanner, which doesn't scan a
file unless specifically told to, I'm not recommending it, as its scan is quite
slow, however I did find out why it wont actively scan. It relies on a sister
program called WinPooch, which is a sort of firewall for software operations.
It hooks the fopen(), connect(), exec(), and registry functions, at the API
level. I believe it is so powerful, that one could actually have a virus, and
WinPooch will ask you if it can infect files. A great tool to easily see what a
program is doing.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

     Some good games:<br>   
     Games are very important, and often underestimated by Operating systems geeks and other assorted 
     <a href="http://www.fsfeurope.org/">free software foundation</a> experts&nbsp;:-)<br> You'll be able to 
     find for next to nothing some outstanding games, a couple of seasons after their   
     first publishing: <u><font color=blue>waiting</font> (and more generally <font color=blue>refusing 
     to update on the fly</font>) is always a good idea with software</u>: 
     often enough the expensive new games -and applications- are full of bugs, because in the rush to 
     publish the 
     producers keep very few resources for quality controls. <br>In most  cases a good game 
     will cost after only six months down to  1/10 of the original price, and will appear simultaneously  on many a  
     PC-magazine cover (so you do not have to buy the most expensive magazine either). And those very magazines 
     will appear on second-hand bookshop after -say- another coupla months for 1/5 of their original low price. 
     Mind you: this is still something not free, just something <font color=blue>VERY</font> cheap, duh.<br><font color=blue>Free</font> is 
     the fact that by the time good games are published on 
     some magazine covers it will ALSO be easy to find on the web <font color=blue>a "no-CD"</font> (or "no-DVD") 
     <font color=blue>patch</font>. Hence you'll be able to offer the game 
     AND the patch on a single 
     CD/DVD and make many a friend (and  friends' sons) happy for Xmas. This is basically
      for free and, for old applications, 
      hardly illegal&nbsp;:-) <br><br>
     Anyway, the real problem with games, and especially with all these "frilly-glamour looking" games, is that most of the 
     time they are extremely boring after a short while. The ENGINE of the game is crap, just the looking is good.  Kids and 
     morons realize it only afterwards.<br>
     So you'll have to <a href="evaluate.htm">evaluate</a>  cleverly your targets, and here -again- time will tell. The web 
     is full with people spitting venom on expensive games that do not work well/are boring/are total crap despite the advertisement hypo <font color=blue>AFTER A COUPLE OF MONTHS</font> (at least) from 
     their first appearance.
     <br><br>Don't believe that "<font color=blue>recent is better</font>". Most of the time (with exceptions) this 
     is simply NOT true for software, far from it.<br>Check it by yourself: 
     You'll be able to find an incredible quantity of very good games, of course for free, if you follow 
the paths of the "<a href="http://s.teoma.com/search?q=abandonware&qcat=1&qsrc=1&submit.x=36&submit.y=7">Abandonedwares</a>".

             There are, of course, two "classical" games everyone should have, try out in depth, enjoy for years, master 
             if he finds the time, 
             study with gusto and learn upon all his life long: <a href="http://nngs.cosmic.org/hmkw/mystery/index.html">Go</a> 
             ("<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gnugo/gnugo.html">Go</a> isn't everything.

             and <a href="zipped/!GENIUS2.ZIP">Chess</a> (alternatively you can download the free, french
             <a href="http://tchecmeet.free.fr/concept/concept.htm">tchechmeet</a>, by Olivier de Lannoy). Another 
             very interesting, albeits old, "abandonendware" strategic game is <a href="http://mujweb.cz/Zabava/Titans/Pendulous.htm">pendulous</a>, 
             which, its graphic simplicity notwithstanding, allows you to develop and finetune its different A.I.s and 
             could hook a gamer for years. <!-- Here a <a href="zipped/!pendulous2.ZIP">local copy</a> (520.815 bytes) of it.--><br><br>
             For schools, some logical games may also be useful: <a href="http://stephane.mitermite.free.fr/index_en.html">fire</a>, by 
             Stéphane Mitermite is a delightful sokoban-type puzzle, only with two moving elements, is completely free and

             is one of the best jigsaw games around, with a nice, if crippled, free download version. (The protection 
             is however explained in full <a href="http://www.woodmann.com/fravia/99solu/spatcom.htm">here</a>).<br> 
             For schools that do not need all the most recent additions, however, <a href="zipped/!BREAKER.zip">an older full 
             version of Brainsbreaker</a> can 
             be easily found on the web.

     As everyone knows, the best train simulators of the planet, by far, are 
     Auran's <a href="http://www.auran.com/TRS2004/default.htm">Trainz</a> and 
      Microsoft's (actually <a href="http://www.virtual-rail.co.uk/krs.htm">Kuju</a>'s) <a href="http://www.uktrainsim.com/">Train 
      Simulator</a>. 
     <br>
     Trainz is beautiful, a joy to play and compose, and allows you magnificient "on the fly" 
     settings. 
     MSTS is almost equally beautiful, but more awkward to 
     "compose" sceneries with. Should be preferred for more serious physical effects and track reconstructions, however.<br>
     Both allown  months (years) of uninterrupted play but are -alas-  
     commercial products that you are supposed to pay for (even if easily found on the web 
     for free with  all their addons).
     <br>Anyway, as usual, we don't have to rely on snotty commercial products. You can use 
     <a href="http://mackoy.cool.ne.jp/index4.html">BVE</a>, serious if a tag primitive, 
     with a huge amount of followers and contributors, that -alas- requires Microsoft's NET crap.<br>
     Also for kids you can have a try at <a href="http://brainbombers.com/index.html">Rule the Rail</a>, with its 
      free starter kit.<br> For simple layouts you can have a look 
      at <a href="http://www.trainplayer.com/Site2/Kalmbach%20Plans.html">train player</a>.<br>
    Of course you can use at once also the fantastic <a href="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/slsim/screenshots.html">spoorsim</a>, 
     by Charl Vockerodt,
      with ONE diesel and 
     ONE steam (South african) locomotives that will give joy to any kid of the world, for free (version one,  
     <a href="http://www.modellbahnsoftware.de/Simu/spoorsim.htm">version two</a> was the last published).<br>
     Read the instructions and learn or print <a href="http://www.virtualrailroader.com/Library/SpoorKeysCode.pdf">the command 
     list</a> BEFORE playing spoorsim, 
     there's no mouse support inside

               Note that a possible  almost "global" software alternative is said to be represented by the free suite

A very good place that Kane pointed out: 
<a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?q=theappyouwant&hl=en&safe=off&lr=&ie=UTF-8&group=alt.comp.freeware.*&sa=G&scoring=d">alt.comp.freeware</a>, 
a <a href="usenet.htm">usenet</a> group populated by people who despise 
<a href="malware.htm">spyware/malware</a> and don't consider shareware an option.
<br><br>
How to search it is simple, either use a search query of something you want 
for instance "file manager" or look for people who have asked whats a good freeware alternative, 
eg "windows commander" to find what they suggested was similar. <br><br>
An interesting alternative is to use as a query an ad hoc snippet in a given language, see for instance how using
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&as_qdr=all&q=%2B%22promuovere+%2A+programmi+gratuiti%22+&btnG=Search">+"promuovere * programmi gratuiti" </a> will point you 
to a nice italian site: <a href="http://htmole.altervista.org/mainpage.htm">http://htmole.altervista.org/mainpage.htm</a>, while, say, 
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&as_qdr=all&q=%2B%22f%C3%B6rder%22+freeware&btnG=Search">+"förder" freeware</a> will 
point you to relevant german sites. And if you try similar searches on the <a href="regional.htm">regional</a> search engines 
your signal will be  even stronger, given the known  advantages of going regional in order to reduce noise (instead of using google).
<br><br>
Another possibility, when searching freeware, is to check the applications listed under the  LGPL (<a href="http://sourceforge.net/softwaremap/trove_list.php?form_cat=16">GNU Library or Lesser General Public License</a>)
<br><br>

     does not seem to evaluate the software scene as severely as he should, and lists a lot of crap as well&nbsp;:-(

<br></center>Free web-based services (Web pages, web mail...)<br><br> 
Well... a <u>really free web-hosting service!</u> (as  pointed out by Kevin Lyons, who is jolly right!):
<br>
"<font color=blue>...a category may be missing.
The item would be a free network web file service.  No, I am not talking
about the geocities garbage with the graffiti window popups all over the place
and truly, if I could find one that didn't act that way I would tell you
the address...

Does it not infuriate you that the dissemination of ideas, even pathetic
individual home pages must come with the dross of advertisements?</font>"        
                      <br><br>
                      And indeed there was a old <a href="big_pro4.htm">project</a>   on these paths, alas, now obsolete... will we ever find some 
                      'really free' providers? 
                      <br>For "email purposes" a possible "almost free" choice? (that is with the least strings 
                      attached and a lot of space and 
                      as less censoship and as much -relative- anonymity as possible)... could this be  <a href="http://www.walla.com">walla</a> 
                      or another    
                      among the  <a href="freemail.htm">free (one giga or plus) email services</a>? 
                      <br>And for hosting  sites?    
                      <br>
                      Your comments would be welcome.
