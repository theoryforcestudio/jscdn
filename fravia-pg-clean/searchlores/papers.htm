</center>...The leader of Suquamis Tribe replied: <i>
The president in Washington tells us that he wants to buy our lands. 
But, how can you buy and sell the sky? It seems completely inappropriate to us. 
Shining leaves of a particular pine tree, even smallest particles of sands in 
our beaches, all the pastures, all the insects mean unforgettable memories for 
my people. Although we don't own the  least bit of this fresh air and water 
how can we sell these in order you to waste? No, the land and sky are of Great 
Manitu. Our Great Manitu is also your God. Will these beautiful forests remain  
when the last indian living in these wild lands disappeared and became only 
a memory living in clouds? Your only aim is wasteful expenditure and to poison 
our rivers for gold and perhaps to darken the sky so to make us not to be able
 to breath. What will happen when white hunters completed to murder all our wild 
 buffalo flocks? Do you think the excellent fresh odour will remain when all the 
 wild hourse flocks are domesticated?"

<i>Well... please excuse this rant.<BR>See: I strongly believe that you should feel by yourself the need to reverse the distorted information 
patterns, news-propaganda and advertisement - that abound so evidently around us (just have a look at my 
<a href="realicra/realicra.htm">reality cracking</a> section). If you don't feel such a need, or if you believe you 
already have your own valuable sources of real information, this part of my site 
will probably not interest you much (even if I think you'r in for a surprise).<br>Note that it is not only a matter of pushed advertisement, 
whereby we find ourselves - faces down - in the sorry situation where we  
now remember better <font color=blue>some ads</font> we have heard (a thousand times) in our youth
 than we are able to recall  the names of <font color=blue>the friends we had</font> (don't you too 
believe 
that somebody should pay for this?). Shouldn't 
we</i> <font color=blue>[</fonT><A HREF="antiadve.htm">retaliate</a><font color=blue>]</fonT> <i>("anti advertisement": an ongoing project)
?</i>
<br><br>The Ancient Greeks believed that you could not rely on someone else to tell you
what is right or wrong: everyone he himself must
be a
researcher in search of truth.<br>
Today, people rely on all sort of media
to tell them "the real news". 
The problem - and the ironical aspect of such an attitude at the same time - is that in the awful commercial society we live in all medias - bar 
some parts of the Internet - are OWNED by someone, who will obviously pursue 
his own 
interests. You can bet that these media's "search for the truth" 
- in the unlikely hipothesis that it 
will be at all pursued - <SPAN STYLE="color: black; background: yellow">will never be allowed 
to contrast the interests of their owners</span>.<br><br>Unfortunately it is NOT ONLY a simple problem 
of 'ownership' (whereby a newspaper owned by -say- a car-factory-owner will always be against 
bykes and against any "pedestrian 
solution" for our cities and will continuously (and viciously) push in order to compel 
people to use a stinking car to fetch their 
beers two-hundred meters from where they happen to vegetate).<br>
<bR>There are MANY more cases of 'orchestrated 
propaganda', as I tried to show with my old "propaganda cracking" essay 
about <a href="realicra/natoagr1.htm">Common 
propaganda techniques</a> in the  context of the NATO / Yugoslawjan war.<bR>
Indeed it is so easy to 'orchestrate' mass media, that curious "ethically correct" 
censorship phenomena now appear. It is for instance in all "mainstream" European media 
nowaday practically "forbidden" 
to deal with all the (huge) criminality problems due to 
immigration (this is most evident for instance in France).<br>Alas! Since a lot of 
poor and simple people, that do not happen to have a villa in a closed and well behaving 
part of the town <u>have to deal</u> with these very problems in some 
peripheries, it is no wonder at all that -as a a consequence- quite a lot of 
zombies lean more and more towards little pathetical (and nazistical) "simplifiers" like 
LePen in France, the Vlaamsblock in Belgium, Haider in Austria or Bossi in Italy.
<br><br>The real problem is 
that 
<SPAN STYLE="color: black; background: yellow">reality is quite complex</span>, not simple: therefore there are MANY "news" and MANY truths, 
and of course there is
nowhere any 
simple "miracle explanation" you could use to interprete the
global complexity of the world surrounding you. Lot of gains for those that profess a "simple" solution 
for everything. The fact that such a solution is complete nonsense does not mean NOTHING in the real 
world of politics. Big industries in Germany were in 1944 still paying the nazi, 
even as russian and american bombs 
were destroying them black and blue. There is an ineluttable logic in stupidity. 
Moreover: profit and cynism are both very strong 
forces, that you -as a reverser- should always take account of. Actually the very moment you meet somebody who 
preaches to have a "solution" for all problems, you better 
try to remain some steps "behind" him, so that you have the time 
to sneak into a side-alley when the shooting starts and that moron gets what he jolly deserves. 
<br><br>
This makes things quite complicated of course: "What? No compass? No weltanschauung as simple as 
"I understand everything through 
this gimmick philosophy"? Yep: this complicates things... on the other hand 
<SPAN STYLE="color: black; background: yellow">propaganda and his ugly offspring:
advertisement</span> are 
simplifiers, and corresponds thus
better to what people await: most people want to feel that issues
are simple rather than complex, they want to have their prejudices
confirmed, they want to feel that they 'belong' somewhere (with the implications
that others do not), and need to pinpoint one or more "enemies" to blame for
their frustrations.
<bR><bR>That is where the capability of searching can be quite helpful. But it will 
not be sufficient alone. Evaluating what you find is also very important, in 
a web of rumors, conspiration theories, balooney sites.
<br>
The web gives tremendous opportunities for propaganda, but it
gives also,
for the first time in the history of mankind, tremendous
opportunities to
COUNTER propaganda. Some snippets of "real" information MUST be
exchanged
behind all the "fog" by the puppet masters, the problem is to find them.<br>


   
<br>
 
Propaganda and advertisement take many forms and affect all of us, mostly in a
negative way.
The printing press, and mass communications technology, have
facilitated greatly 
the use of propaganda by governments, large corporations the
wealthy and the powerful. 
They control the outlets of information sources and use it - of course - for
their own benefit. 
The purpose of propaganda is to distort the truth.<br><br>
Finding the truth was never easy. 
It is like searching for a needle in the haystack. It takes lots
of effort. 
I hope the resources I have tried to gather will help you on your own quest.

Any form of concentrated power, whatever it is, is not going to want to be subjected to popular democratic control or, 
for that matter, to market discipline. Powerful sectors, including corporate wealth, are naturally opposed to 
functioning democracy, just as they're opposed to functioning markets, for themselves, at least. It's just natural. 
They do not want external constraints on their capacity to make decisions and act freely. It entails that the elites 
will be extremely undemocratic.</font>" <br><br>
"<font color=blue> Democracy should produce <i>free people</i>. 
That's the "ultimate aim" of a democratic society: <i>not the production of goods</i>, but <i>the production of free human beings 
associated with one another on terms of equality</i>.</font>"

newspaper you need, but don't old your breath for truths... being able to read any newspapers 
of the planet does not mean much if you don't know how 
to filter out the very rare snippets of information and to recognize the few valuable sources of information that 
are not simple progandistic megaphones of their owners' interests. This said it is for sure quite instructive 
to learn that slightly different soups of commercial advertisement, 
hysterical nationalism & ridicolous propaganda are served - under all latitudes - 
to the zombies...

Of course there's not only propaganda, but also a lot of CENSORSHIP being enforced. Often enough 
propaganda techniques are used to enforce censorship. You may wanto to check  
(and fight against) the recent  european laws about copyright under preparation at the Council
and the European Parliament, that the political lackeys of the commercial powers
 that be are going to adopt following the  recent two 
frightening 
Communications of the European Commission COM(2000)789 "Follow-up to the Green Paper on combating counterfeiting 
and piracy in the single market" and COM(2000)890  "Creating a Safer Information Society by
Improving the Security of Information Infrastructures and
Combating Computer-related Crime" (Euphemisms are particularly abundant during 
propaganda indoctrination campaigns, therefore they're of course pounding quite 
heavy with 'euphemistical rhetoric' in these texts... the commercial puppetteers and 
slavemasters 
are for instance called "<font color=blue>interested parties</font>" in the Commission's Jargon... allow me to puke&nbsp;:-(<br><bR>
Yet against propaganda and against censorship we can always use 
the same old weapons: <font color=blue>transparence</Font>, 
<font color=blue>knowledge spreading</Font> and of 
course the most powerful one: <font color=blue>sarcasm</Font> (as I said above: 
<i>Ridentem dicere verum Quid vetat?
</i>)<br><br>
There are many ways to ridiculize censorship attempts. Some interesting ones 
 have been devised and/or collected 
by defenders of the 
CSS Descrambler (see, for instance <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/DeCSS/Gallery/index.html">Dave 
Touretzky</a> gallery).  Since some American clowns, under 
commercial pressure, stated
 that executable source code was not subject to First Amendment 
protection against prior restraint of speech, and thus its publication could be prohibited, other ways to publish the code 
had to be found for the United States. Some of them quite inventive. Such 
approaches are interesting because 
they can be applied <i>mutatis mutandis</i> to many other similar cases.<br><br>
Just one of these examples will clarify what I mean: the complete C-source code of the CSS Descrambler (for 
reading encrypted DVDs) is for instance located 
INSIDE the image below&nbsp;:-)<br>

To extract css-auth.tar.gz from the graphic file above, use an <a href="http://www.searchlores.org/tools.htm#hexe">hexeditor</a>, 
go to byte 0x00799D and copy the 
next 0x547E bytes to another file. Voila: the clownish censorship attempt brilliantly rebuked.<br>
(Of course all this is nonsense: should you really need a Cssdescrambler you would 
immediately, since you'r supposed to be a searcher, just 
find one of the many copies of the complete C source code that exist all over the web&nbsp;:-)

,00.html</a>: <font color=blue>Kilroy-Silk defies critics and insists: I'm no racist</font>
         <br><br>
It took me quite some time to find the REAL article (not just the
citations) by Kilroy-Silk, see if you are quicker, it seems to me
that many of those discussing thesed things on their racist/anti-racist
blogs all over the (UK-related) web never happened to read the real stuff.
           <br><br>
Not that what kilroy -- a politician turned media presentator for
housewives, quite a slimy figure, btw -- writes in his text makes much
sense (even if some does), but that's not the point: the point is
that when something happens the real data "disappear" and a lot of
noise, like huge clouds, settles on the web.  This is annoying, to say the least, for <a target=_top HREF="terminology.htm#termi_s">Seekers</A>.
           <br><br>
See if and how you can find the article yourself... starting from
the guardian link above and without using the google link below until you have solved this.
            <br><br>
btw: i finally got the article with the simple string
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&as_qdr=al
l&q=%22Original+Kilroy+article%22&btnG=Google+Search">http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&as_qdr=al
l&q=%22Original+Kilroy+article%22&btnG=Google+Search</a>
but it took me some time to get to it, i kept using snippets from
the citations found trough the guardian article above, and they
all brought me to other citations, like matrioskas, never to the
real target.
        <br><br>
Seems to me that people really love and enjoy to discuss things
they hear from second hand, almost never using sources. Note how
ALL the official links you will find using the guardian artice
above will bend backwards in order NOT to report the complete
text.
       <br><br>
"<font color=blue>There is not one single British asylum seeker in any Arab
country.</font>" <br>That's a rhetorical little gem :-) 

<br><br>(You will find the complete text of the "racist" article    
 by Kilroy-Silk on <a href="http://fravia.2113.ch/phplab/mbs.php3/mb001">our messageboard</a>, but this would mean that you are not 
 capable of finding it by yourself on the wide wide web :-)

<blockquote>politically correctness hinders searching? A case of signal drowned by noise</blockquote> Don't know... maybe I was too lucky... reading Gardian's article: 
<br>
<br><a target=_top href="http://media.guardian.co.uk/broadcast/story/0,7493,1120725,00.html">http://media.guardian.co.uk/broadcast/story/0,7493,1120725,00.html</a>
<br>
<br>and knowing a little about journalistic language patterns, I would bet that the following strings are in the original article:
<br>
<br><ul><li>'<font color=red>suicide bombers, limb-amputators, women-repressors</font>'<li>"headlined '<font color=red>We owe Arabs nothing</font>'"</ul>
<br>As the second one seemed more promising, I asked Google the following queries:
<br>
<br><ol><li><a target=_top href="http://216.239.39.99/search?num=50&hl=en&lr=&ie=ISO-8859-1&q=%22We+owe+Arabs+nothing%22">"We owe Arabs nothing"</a> 
&lt;-- <i>the obvious one,</i><li><a target=_top href="http://216.239.39.99/search?num=50&hl=en&lr=&ie=ISO-8859-1&q=%22We+owe+Arabs+nothing+***%22">"We owe Arabs nothing ***"</a> 
&lt;-- <i>underline possible hints of second hand information,</i><li><a target=_top href="http://216.239.39.99/search?num=50&hl=en&lr=&ie=ISO-8859-1&q=%22We+owe+Arabs+nothing+**%22">"We owe Arabs nothing **"</a> 
&lt;-- <i>underline only two words in order to try to see the snipet,</i><li><a target=_top href="http://216.239.39.99/search?q=%22We+owe+Arabs+nothing+**%22&num=50&hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&filter=0">"We owe Arabs nothing **"</a> 
&lt;-- <i>show all search results.</i></ol>
<br>After a quick browsing searching for pages containing more than citations, i.e. more than something along these lines:
<br>
<br><ul><li>"bla bla bla" [...] Kilroy Silk / said <li>?bla bla bla? [...] Kilroy Silk / said <li>'bla bla bla' [...] Kilroy Silk / said </ul>
<br>I found quickly this promising search result:
<br>

</ul>

We live in a society obsessed by plagiarism... wich is *not* necessarily bad from a seeker's point of view, because that way we can trace to the source who said what :=) 
         <br><br>
When someone cites somebody, in written works, he must enclose the cited phrases in quotation marks 
(i.e. ',",?) if those are small, or double indent them if they are big, and give credit to the author providing his name. 
<br><br>Seekers can take advantage of these habits by getting strings that must be in the original text...
