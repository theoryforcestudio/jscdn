<h1>Enemy tracking</h1><h3>2)  Language patterns and the stalking tablet</h3></center>
<center><h3><i>(Fravia's semantical reverse engineering tricks)</i></h3>

 <br>~<br>
Enemy tracking, a very difficult art, can be divided into stalking, reversing language patterns  and luring. In order to 
stalk you need a deep knowledge of Usenet spamming (and war) techniques like flaming, 
trolling and crossposting. A good reverser can moreover easily 'reconstruct' (part of) the 
snailtrail of his 
enemies and defeat their smoke curtains  
applying some easy semantical reverse engineering tricks. Finally the reverser will 
lure his targets into the open web and identify it.<hr width="33%">

<center><h2>Reversing language patterns</h2>
</center>
<p>
 I have randomly taken from today post two snippets :-)<br>Now tell me, 
this one:<FONT COLOR=PURPLE>
<prE>man..could ya pleeeeez send me ( if ya got it ) the Casmate crack ??? 
need the shit bad..gonna d/l the software directly form the casmate site..</prE></fonT>
And this one:<FONT COLOR=PURPLE>
<prE>I subscribe to a very good service: LinkAlarm that periodically 
checks the links on my pages (now well over 200 links). Do you use it?</prE></fonT>
have been written by the same person?<p>
The answer is NO, they have been written by two different persons, but how can I be 
so sure? The language patterns differ, yet this could of course be intentional. You 
will know why, I believe, as soon as you have read the content of this page.<br>(<font color=red>*</fonT>I 
have published the 'solution' at the bottom, in reverse order, you'll check later :-)
<p>
Well, reversing language patterns seems to be something pretty new: I could not find much 
on the web. So I'll try to summarize,  and slowly add in this page, 
what I have noticed experimentally until now. I'll also teach you <u>my own</u> best stalking  
method: <font color=blue>Fravia's stalking tablet</fonT> (TM :-)<br>Please 
take note that in the following, as usual in our reversing tradition, with "target" I 
intend the person (and pseudo) 
you want to find more data about (and if possible his real identity)<hr>
There are many 'inconscious' characteristics in someone's writings and ramblings, and 
contraryly to what you may think, email communication does indeed carry A LOT of clues that 
are <u>as useful as</u> the usual body language clues you costantly 
check when you communicate physically with 
someone or all the clues given by your partner's voice when you are at the telephone.<br>
Some of these clues are of linguistical, other of grammatical and others are of what I would 
call 'Internettical' type... with this I mean clues that neither voice nor paper 
printed communication usually convoy.<p>

Since we must start from somewhere, as first clue I would use 
 the "gender" differences.<bR>For gender here I do not 
mean that you can state if your target is a woman or a man (if you could it would be 
probably a pretty poor target :-)<bR>I mean that you can state if your target uses 'male' or 
'female' patterns in his communication... 
chances are that if he uses these patterns under one bogus 
identity, he'll use them under all other ones as well... :-)<bR>Now, please, 
understand me correctly, 
because I do 
not want to be pulled into any useless 'gender style' discussion... and I know that many 
American friends are obsessed by this kind of crap (writing she/he and so on). 
So let's be clear: I 
have always been convinced that, apart from minor obvious physical differences, there 
is NO real difference between Women and Men, in all good or evil characteristics 
of our specie. Women can (and of course <u>should</u>, with <i>bona pace</i> of all species of 
religious idiotical fundamentalists) drive, kill, write, love, play 
and fight as well as any man, 
and anyway there are so many women with male psychological characteristics and so many 
men with female psychological characteristics that I believe it 
does not make much sense  
to differenciate anything between the twin parts of our race.<p>Yet among the few 
physical differences cited above is the well known fact 
that women give birth to children, and this, added to 
society pressures, common tradition, biased instruction, television crap, 
advertisement conditioning, 
you name it,  makes a LOT of almost inconscious differences and 
can actually give us the possibility of reversing (in part) 
the 'gender leaning' language patterns of our target.
<p>
 In other words analysing usenet style emailings you may check if  your target has a more 
"female" or a more "male" personality basing on the following:
<p>
The male style is characterized by adversariality: put-downs, strong often contentious
assertions, lengthy and/or frequent postings, self-promotion, and sarcasm (not always witty).
<p>The female-gendered
style, in contrast, has two aspects which typically are found together: 
supportiveness and attenuation.
<p>
Male-targets use more coarse and abusive language and seem to change their opinions slightly 
less often than females-targets.
<p>
Female-targets send more messages explicitly referring to other members of the group than Male-targets.
<p>
Context differences certainly may obscure or speciously highlight your 
results. Always 
work <i>cum grano salis</i>. In the usual 
context of Internet discussion groups "normal" group psychology does not apply. 
Group membership on usenet is very large and members
 do not know all others in the group (especially if there are a large number of
"lurkers", people who read messages but does not write responses and therefore are 
invisible inside the discussion).<br>
Morever on Usenet the task is mostly not to produce a specific result, but
rather to generate ideas and discuss them. 
<p>
Male-gendered targets in discussion groups use language
that a) states facts without personal ownership, b) challenges group members, c) calls for
explicit action, d) is argumentative, e) uses coarse and abusive language, and f) attempt 
to indicates the
members status.<p>
Female-gendered targets 
in discussion groups  use a language that a) self-discloses, b) states
personal ownership of opinion, c) apologizes, d) asks questions, e) uses "we" pronouns, f)
responds directly to others in the group, and g) seeks to prevent or alleviate tension or
arguments.
<p>
Exactly as we have a male/female differenciation, there are MANY other 'sharp 
edges' that you can use to stalk your target, as you will see in my tablet below.
<p>
Keep in mind that
computer conversation draws from features of both written and oral discourse and as such 
has a whole serie of linguistic and textual patterns: <u>Emphatic</u>, <u>Humorous</u>, <u>Informal</u>.
<p>

Syntactic informality often takes the form of incomplete sentences and conversational cadences.
For instance<pre>"Waitamoment!... what d'you mean?"; "Hmm, I see. . .";  "Mmm, no, no... I didn't mind it..."</pre>
<p>
The informal, conversational rhythm created by the "Hmm", "Mmm" and the ellipsis is clearly intended to
evoke (although through written means) 
<u>spoken</u> discourse. Similarly, , "Wouw", "Sigh", "Gulp" 
and "Gasp" are used
occasionally to mimic vocalizations or paralinguistic features. 
<p>
Another device used to mimic characteristics of speech is the textual indication of emphasis on
words or phrases (present in many messages). For example, some targets 
OFTEN use capital
letters to create the sense of oral emphasis, 
others *use asterisks*, others S P A C E S and some use the html tags, 
inside their emails, &lt;u&gt; for this same purpose &lt;/u&gt;.

<p>
 Such emphasis cannot be indicated in the written text using underlining
or italics, because most protocols for exchanging electronic mail, don't support them 
yet (expect an explosion of clues as soon as colors will be commonly email exchanged :-)

<p>
All these clues depend from 
the alphanumeric characters of written text, that are used to
evoke the emphasis of speech.
<p> In some
cases, exclamation points  add oral emphasis, as in the subject line "No No! Flush it!!"<br>

<p>Yet there are also involontary clues: <br>
A good stalker always takes note of how many exclamation points and how many question 
marks the target 'commonly' uses. There are many different patterns:
<br>?<br> &nbsp; ?  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  (space 
and question mark)<br>??<br>???<br>? ? ?  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and so on<br>This is 
of course true also for commas<font color=red>,</fonT> colons<font color=red>,</fonT>semicolons <font color=red>,</fonT> and <font color=red>(</fonT>parenthesis <font color=red>)</fonT> that may or may not 
be spaced before the preceding word.<bR>
Another typical involontary clue is due to the 'typing habits' of your target. He may, 
for instance, often enough write 'inetresting' instead of 'interesting'; 'nuff' instead 
of 'enough', and so on and so on. This is of course pretty rare, yet it happens in less 
evident parts of the message. For instance, does your target break line<br>when he wants 
to substantiate a point? Does he write short or long sentences? Does he use tirets - like this - 
or rather parenthesis (like this)? And what about his emotycons? :-] is NOT :o)<p>
Finally, does he write "i use" or "I use"? Often enough email is sent WITHOUT any 
automated spelling correction check whatsoever. 


<p>
There are also 'comportamental" e-mail clues, for instance there are some 
email comments, 
on a thread, that at times clearly resemble those that occur 
in a face-to-face meeting, when a speaker turns
towards and briefly addresses one of the individuals present, 
but without yielding the floor to
that person: "What's your opinion about this, Brick?" "Hope to hear from Cal about 
this stuff!<p>
This kind of attitude pattern  can constitute a very STRONG clue when you try to 
identify a target.
<p>
 Another example is when you suspect, examining the thread, 
the existence of private, backchannels between your target and somebody else. <bR>
Backchannels, on usenet, are nothing else than the electronic communication 
between two or more
individuals <u>that is not sent to the group as a whole</u>.<br>This can 
at times be evinced from the contexts. Such messages, like whispered side
conversations in a meeting, involve concerns or strategies 
adopted by allies on particular
issues.<br>
In this cases you may try to find out 
which are the 'allies' and the 'reference points' of your target 
inside the group and attack from those sides.<br> You'll VERY FREQUENTLY find 
this when you stalk trolls (see <a href="enemy.htm" tppabs="http://fravia.net/enemy.htm">enemy.htm</a>), because 
trolls are trollyng mostly IN ORDER to find and contact other trolls-savy.
<p>Yet another 'comportamental' example is the interplay among MORE THAN ONE 
fictious identities. In Balif's example (see <a href="enemy.htm" tppabs="http://fravia.net/enemy.htm">enemy.htm</a>), you 
have seen how his target used a whole plethora of faked personalities in order 
to create a 'group' impression. Of course the more fictious identities you identify, 
the easier it is to see the common sharp edges they possess.
<p>
Thus the language of Usenet demonstrates several characteristics more typical of
oral communication in an organizational setting, casual conversation or, rather, 
organized meetings.
<p>
In fact the 
syntax and word choice often evoke conversational informality, emphasis, rhythm, and even
vocalizations. On the other hand, the messages may also 
evince characteristics of written discourse such
as formal wording, careful composing and editing, and textual formatting.<br>A typical case 
is when there is a LIST of points<ul><li>1) inside</li><li>2) your target's</li>
<li>3) email</li></ul>There is also at times an interesting 
evidence of patterns that are a distinctively characteristic of web 
interaction. Many messages display ascii graphic, 
typographical ascii jokes, signets and subject line humor, patterns also that are very 
unlikely in written and oral discourse. All such patterns ca  be, 
at times, interesting clues.
<p>
These clues and patterns reflect both the capabilities of the web and the characteristics
of the group. The interactivity of oral discourse is in fact supported and encouraged on Usenet by
the ability to engage in rapid exchanges and to collect and 
respond to embedded excerpts of previous
messages. At the same time the asynchronous nature of the web and the editing capabilities of
the participants' email applications allow 
reflection and crafting patterns more characteristic of the
written discourse. The web's ability to support informal 
textual exchanges allow a playful relationship with the text, or 
to indulge in flaming.
<p>Of course all sort of interaction, 
the characteristics of the individual targets, their social
community, and their motherlanguage influence the particular combination of linguistic and
textual characteristics that they express.<p>Do not underestimate
 the richness and complexity of email communication... as soon as 
you'll have learned your stalking abc you'll never miss much all 
the clues that the real, non virtual world gives you when you communicate.

<p>I don't think it needs a lot of explanations, keep in mind that the PURPOSE of the above tablet 
is not so much to understand directly WHO is your target, but to understand if your target is in 
reality the one candidate you suspect. Once you have zeroed in, you'll stalk the 
(presumibly less protected) 
other PSEUDO in order to find out -if all works well- WHO is your target... 
and some  luring techniques (and social engineering) 
will at that moment be quite useful, see my <a href="luring.htm" tppabs="http://fravia.net/luring.htm">luring.htm</a> section...

A word of warning:</h2><br>
You found my site and you are reading this, therefore you have now a
relatively  "high" level of web-lore and reversing knowledge.<br>
Until recently I kept this section of mine in 
a "closed" server

going public with my stalking lore because spamming has taken incredibly 
annoying proportions and I have decided to create as many powerful reversers as possible 
in order to tackle and destroy the 
commercial idiots.<p>Yet, as you perfectly know, 
 knowledge can be used either for good or for evil. Knowledge, especially 
this kind of knowledge, is a powerful weapon. You may use it to defend yourself but 
you may <u>not</u> use it to offend innocents<br>I hope 
to have you at my side, fighting on the web for knowledge and against all 
commercial zombies, but I obviously cannot avoid  
you joining the dark side, should you want to... if you do, however, take care not to meet me.
