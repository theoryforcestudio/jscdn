<P ALIGN=LEFT>   Forget about cookies, cookies are child's play
<SPAN LANG="en-US">compared</SPAN> to the sheer nastiness of Gator or
to the <SPAN LANG="en-US">insolence</SPAN> of Newton Knows best. The
more I studied them, the angrier I got, I simply had to write an
article about them to warn the unsuspecting easy pray out there.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<H2 ALIGN=LEFT>What is spyware? Is there a difference between adware
and spyware?</H2>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>   Let's first get our definitions straight so to
speak. There is a lot of different names floating around. Spyware are
seemingly useful software programs installed on your PC that will
observe your actions, gather data on your surfing habits, what you
are interested in, compile that data and send it back to the main
server<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">. In this sense, they are
<SPAN LANG="en-US">similar</SPAN> to a Trojan horse. Adwares mainly
receive ads in form of images(simple gif, animated gifs) or other
multimedia type files.  Adwares can also include components which
will spy on users' actions.  Those components which are installed on
the PC without a user's permission can be called sneakware. Spamwares
are essentially the same as Adwares-serving unwanted ads. A lot of
people(me included) have began calling all those types simply
scumware. </FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<H2>Gator</H2>
<P>  There are many scumwares loose on the Internet. In fact, if I
look at each and every one out there, I could easily create a whole
book of 300+ pages just on that subject alone and won't have any
space left over for my main topic! That is why i have narrowed the
list to the most notorious ones and the ones you are most likely to
meet. Gator/GAIN is one of them.</P>
<H1><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt">Description</FONT></FONT></H1>
<P>   Gator is one of the nastiest spyware around.. Gator's parent
company has recently changed their name to Claria
Corporation(http://www.claria.com) in a vain attempt to <SPAN LANG="en-US">disassociate</SPAN>
themselves from Gator, but just as Radiate case, they still stink
just as bad. It is carried by almost all P2P file-share apps, and
free IPS like Netzero. <SPAN LANG="en-US">I can't</SPAN> seem to be
able to get rid of it. Every time I turn around, there is a fresh
install of Gator on my system. Worse, Gator software is composed of
several separate modules incarnations and names- Gator, 
<FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">OfferCompanion</FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica">,
</FONT></FONT>Trickler, GAIN, GMT.exe,  CMESys.exe and a quite a few
others. 
</P>
<P>   <FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Gator/GAIN is
marketed as a software product that will automatically fill in
passwords and other form-elements on Web pages, but its main purpose
is to load an advertising spyware module called OfferCompanion, which
displays pop-up ads when visiting some Web sites. Once installed,
Gator's software never stops running, and it monitors pretty much
everything a user does. The program is freely distributed by
</FONT></FONT>http://www.gainpulbishing.com, but it can be found in a
slew of file-sharing applications, including in the &ldquo;most-downloaded
software&rdquo; on the Internet-the new KaZaa version 3.6 that just
came out a few days ago and which I investigated while writing this
article. In fact, you cannot even install and use KaZaa without
agreeing to also install Gain. Talk about assholes!<FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">
</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P>  <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Gator are so
insolent, here is how they justify what they do as &ldquo;right&rdquo;:</FONT></FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><I>&quot;We
get lots of angry calls; maybe even an attorney calls up because
they're angry,&quot; said Gator's Eagle. &quot;.We explain it's the
consumers' right because we're invited onto the desktop. We're not
changing their content; we're popping up on the consumers' desktop.
Don't they advertise on TV showing competitor comparisons? The only
difference is that we're more effective. </I></FONT></FONT><I>The
next call we get is usually from the VP of sales, saying, 'We would
like to work with you.'&quot; </I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<H1><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt">How
do you get infected with it?</FONT></FONT></H1>
<P>  <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In Gator's
case, it can come into your PC in 3 ways: </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>1. either pre-bundled in either a file-sharing program
such as KaZaa,  iMesh  and a few others, or 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>2. &ldquo;freewares&rdquo; such as AudioGalaxy, Go!zilla
and WeatherBug carry it embedded or 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>2. the so-called  drive-by-installation, using Internet
Explorer's ActiveX controls  where a Web site attempts   to download
and install software(executable code)from a banner or a pop-up ad on
the user's PC.  This is by far the sneakiest way, since most average
users don't have a clue about Secure Zone settings setting, and often
choose Yes when confronted with a dialog, thinking the browser is
simply installing a needed plug in for a web site they are viewing. 
Depending on the browser's security settings, the software will
either download silently and without any user action, or present an
install <SPAN LANG="en-US">dialog.</SPAN> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>  <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Gator is also
now available for download in separate freeware applications called
eWallet and  Precision Time/Date Manager, but nobody in their right
mind would even use those. I personally have never met a person who
has done so.  When installed, Gator begins to <SPAN LANG="en-US">slowly</SPAN>
download and install other modules.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>  
</P>
<H1><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt">What
does it do?</FONT></FONT></H1>
<P><FONT SIZE=3>Gator has two main purposes: </FONT>
</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P>to deliver ads to the user based on the profile it builds 
	</P>
	<LI><P>To collect information on the user's habits, including(but
	not limited to) every page visited, the length of time the user
	spent at each site, what the user is interested in, what ads(if any)
	the user clicks on, any special searches the user does, any keywords
	entered, any and all files downloaded. It saves all that info on a
	file on your computer in a file which identifies your PC through its
	IP address. 
	</P>
</OL>
<P>  <FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">The newest
Gator trick is to <SPAN LANG="en-US">hijack</SPAN> a pop up ad from
another company when users visit a competitor's Web site.  This
practice(which I find rather amusing, I must admit) is known as
&ldquo;being Gatored&rdquo;. It is accomplished by selling common
&ldquo;keywords&rdquo; to companies such as search engines. One
e-tailer that's been bitten is 1-800-Flowers.com. When certain Web
surfers visit the site to browse for bouquets, a pop-up ad appears
for $10 off at chief rival FTD.com. The same sort of thing happens at
AmericanAirlines.com, where a Delta Air Lines promotion is waiting in
the wings. A search on http://search.yahoo.com/bin/search?p=Ford  
for the name &quot;Ford&quot; yields an advertisement from the
company itself. In contrast, on
</FONT></FONT>http://www.altavista.com/sites/search/web<FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">?=Ford
&amp;pg=q&amp;kl=XX&amp;search=Search  search for &quot;Ford&quot;
draws an ad for a Toyota truck. Ads like these find their way onto
browser windows through &quot;plug-ins&quot; that come bundled with
certain software downloads. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P>   <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Keyword
advertising consists mostly of selling trademark owners the rights to
their own names--on a search engine, for example. But the reverse is
true in many new application services such as Gator. And because the
applications are downloaded with the consumer's consent, the
companies say they are standing on firm legal ground, despite
numerous complaints from marketing executives.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>  <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After compiling
the data it receives, Gator sells to to other advertisers, who can
then purchase the opportunity to display pop up ads at certain
moments, such as when specific words appear on the screen or specific
words are typed into search engines.  </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<H1><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt">Gator/GAIN
comes in several modules:</FONT></FONT></H1>
<P><B>Gator (iegator.dll and others)</B> <BR>is the main software,
which auto completes Web forms (which is completely unnecessary for
many users these days, since IE and Mozilla (and Netscape?) have had
automatic form completion, password saving, etc. built in for some
time. 
</P>
<P><B>OfferCompanion</B> <BR>is the advertising spyware module. It is
responsible for spying on your Web browsing habits, downloading and
displaying pop-up ads, and transmitting personal information to
Gator. 
</P>
<P><B>Trickler (fsg.exe, fsg-ag.exe, fsg*.exe)</B> <BR> is an
&quot;install stub&quot;, a small program that is installed with the
application you really wanted. (Gator almost always appears on your
system due to installing other software, and not the installer
available from Gator's website.) When installed, Trickler inserts a
Run key in your Registry so that it is silently and automatically
loaded every time you start your computer. Trickler runs hidden and
very slowly downloads the rest of Gator/OfferCompanion onto your
system. It is suggested that this &quot;trickling&quot; activity is
intended to slip under the user's radar, the steady, low usage of
bandwidth going unnoticed. 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><I>NOTE:
While often named fsg.exe, Trickler can go under other similar names,
such as fsg-ag.exe (installed with AudioGalaxy) or another name

see, msconfig is a System Configuration Utility and it's got several
options you can modify. Let's now go over each one, briefly discuss 
what  they are and what can be changed inside them.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>   <FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">The General
option specifies what system files your PC reads and executes while
booting up. This option is useful in case of an emergency during Safe
Mode boot up. Normally, most Autoexec.bat and Config.sys files are
empty today, but they used to play a big role in the olden DOS
days(Windows 95 and Windows 98). If you know DOS(and DOS is still
<SPAN LANG="en-US">extremely</SPAN> useful in many ways, even if
Microsoft makes it exceedingly difficult for you to even run DOS
programs on NT based systems such as Windows 2000 and XP) you can
peek inside those files with option 2 and 3 and remove any lines you
don't want or don't think you need. A good idea is instead of
removing the lines, to just place a REM in front of them.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>    <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>System.ini
and Win.ini are more Windows configuration files, telling it how to
boot up. I suggest you don't mess with them unless you really know
what you are doing. Instead you should just concentrate on the last
tab- the</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>   <FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Startup</FONT></FONT>
option is another more advanced way to tell Windows what software to
run when it boots up. Personally, I like to keep mine as clean and
tidy and program-free as possible. I have seen some people's
computers that had at least 30 lines inside Startup, all from various
software packages installed, that did nothing for the user, except
they took memory. I had to argue with a client several days ago,
trying to convince him that in fact, Microsoft's Office <B><I>does
not</I></B> need to be inside Startup and that Yes, <FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">
he <I>still</I> would have been able to use Office any time he wanted

remove NewtonKnows fully. Do not attempt to delete the files

<H2><FONT SIZE=5>SaveNow(When Ushop)</FONT></H2>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3>is one of the newer scumware applications
trying to give Gain a run for their money when it comes to sheer
annoyance. When installed and running, SaveNow appears as an
advertising toolbar that monitors/tracks what sites you visit and
what you are doing online, and pops up separate browser windows  with
targeted advertisements, special offers or sponsored &quot;deals&quot;
when products/shopping/etc. appears on those sites. It also observes
any terms entered into forms. SaveNow gets installed into the Startup
folder so it begins running the moment you boot a computer up.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>  Here is what the honest business men who <SPAN LANG="en-US">distribute</SPAN>
SaveNow have to say about their &ldquo;product&rdquo;:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>There are a vast number of offers and services
available to Internet users that SaveNow may display. In addition,
WhenU.com negotiates exclusive offers to maximize value for users.
SaveNow's goal is to show users information about these offers and
services - right at the moment when they need it. For example, if you
visit a search engine and typed in &quot;long distance&quot;, you
might get an offer for SmartPrice - a site that we found to be the
best for comparing long distance plans. If you visit a travel site,
we might show you how to save 40% on travel at Hotwire. If you visit
a retail site, you might see a coupon that can be used for online
savings</I>.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>  To read more of their wisdom or maybe tell them how you really
feel about SaveNow, visit their web site at: 
<FONT SIZE=3>http://www.whenu.com/about_savenow.html</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt"><B>Distribution</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=3>of  SaveNow happens in several ways, just like
Gain/Gator.</FONT></P>
<P>1. It can come pre-bundled in file-sharing applications such as
BearShare, iMesh and many others.</P>
<P> 2. Software video players such as the <SPAN LANG="en-US">extremely</SPAN>
popular global DivX now carry  SaveNow. DivX player is used to play
movies coded with the wildly popular DivX codec. RadLight video
player is another software that carries it. 
</P>
<P>3. A pop up <SPAN LANG="en-US">advertisement</SPAN> can install
SaveNow via a simple ActiveX control. This way the user doesn't even
know when SaveNow has ben added to his/her system and what Web site
is even responsible 
</P>
<P>4. All the software distributed by Galt Technologies comes
pre-bundled with SaveNow. 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BR><BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>Variants 
</H3>
<H3><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>of SaveNow are
several. </FONT></SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>It
can comes is these known forms: </FONT></SPAN>
</H3>
<P><EM>SaveNow/Download</EM> comes bundled with a &quot;WhenUDownload&quot;
ActiveX control. 
</P>
<P><EM>SaveNow/B</EM> comes without the WhenUDownload component. 
</P>
<P><EM>SaveNow/Save</EM> is a new version, rebranded as 'Save!',
which works in the same manner. 
</P>
<P><EM>SaveNow/Db</EM> is the same as the <EM>Save</EM> variant, but
includes an ActiveX 'marker' control to prevent it being installed
twice. 
</P>
<P><EM>SaveNow/WUInst</EM> is an installer for the <EM>Save</EM>
variant. 
</P>
<P>The <EM>Download</EM>, <EM>Db</EM> and <EM>WUInst</EM> variants of
SaveNow can be detected by the script at this site; <EM>B</EM> and
<EM>Save</EM> cannot. 
</P>
<P>The Db and WUInst variants are also installed by drive-by-download
in pop-ups, often coupled with 'ClockSync' or 'WeatherCast'. 
</P>
<H3><BR><BR>
</H3>
<H2>What it does</H2>
<H3>Advertising</H3>
<P>Yes. SaveNow keeps a list of URLs and terms it is interested in on
disk, in the file 'SaveNow\savenow.db' in Program Files. This file is
obfuscated but it is trivial to decode.* The (large - often over a
megabyte) file maps from these targets to adverts to serve, which are
downloaded through Akamai's proxies. 
</P>
<H3>Privacy violation</H3>
<P>As well as downloading the pop-up ads, SaveNow connects to WhenU's
servers to log the ad impression. It passes the name of the affiliate
software which installed the software, the ID of the advert being
shown, and the site URL or term that caused the pop-up to be
triggered. 
</P>
<P>No cookie is set on these accesses, so at the moment users are not
being tracked across sites visited. 
</P>
<H3>Security issues</H3>
<P>The WUInst variant can be used by any web site to download and
install SaveNow or other code form WhenU. 
</P>
<H3>Stability problems</H3>
<P>Yes, it <U>can</U> cause frequent crashes. 
</P>
<H2>Removing SaveNow</H2>
<P>SaveNow/B can be removed from the 'SaveNow' entry in the Control
Panel's 'Add/Remove Programs' option. SaveNow/Save can sometimes be
removed from a 'Save' entry in Add/Remove Programs. 
</P>
<P>SaveNow/Db does not provide an Add/Remove Programs entry and must
be removed manually. SaveNow/Download may be removed through the
Control Panel, but leaves an ActiveX control behind, see below for
removal. 
</P>
<P>SaveNow often also installs 'WeatherCast', a system tray icon that
displays the current weather conditions, and/or 'ClockSync', a
trivial NTP client. Unless you find these useful for some reason, you
should probably also remove them from Add/Remove Programs. 
</P>
<P>Ad-Aware and Spybot S&amp;D can both remove SaveNow. At the time
of writing, neither will remove the ActiveX object of the Db or
WUInst variants. 
</P>
<H3>Manual removal</H3>
<P>Open the registry (Start-&gt;Run-&gt;regedit) and find the key: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
</CODE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Whenu</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Delete the 'SaveNow' or 'WhenUSave' value. Reboot and you should
be able to delete the 'SaveNow' or 'Save' folder inside 'Program
Files'. 
</P>
<P>To remove the ActiveX objects installed by the Download and Db
variants, open the 'Downloaded Program Files' folder inside the
Windows folder, and delet the SaveNow object. The name of this is
'WhenUDownload' in the Download variant,
'FC327B3F-377B-4CB7-8B61-27CD69816BC3' in the Db variant, and
'E2F2B9D0-96B9-4B25-B90C-636ECB207D18' in the WUInst variant.

<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">   The easiest way to avoid parasite

scumwares are 
</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">a) dependent on it so they can get

sure the people who made it are trustworthy <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Best

Linux and forget about windows all together!</FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P>  1. Begin using a process observer that will show all the
software currently running on your system at all times.  I can easily
find and monitor any of these programs using the great and free
<B><SPAN LANG="en-US">Process</SPAN> Explorer</B> from

A small addition, by fravia+<br><br>
If you are using a windoze system, it could be a good idea to 
install a good firewall, like 
sygate personal firewall pro  (version 5.1 is easy to find on the web). Note, 
however, that if you are using MSIE as a browser, you wont be able to avoid some
'congenit' 
spywares, built inside windoze itself, like the start/search function in windows xp, which connects
on port 80 to sa.windows.com  (207.46.248.249) 
 in order to deliver to microsoft's spyes your IP and what you are searching for on 
your own harddisk.<br>
The start/search function uses in fact windows explorer itself for its spying activities, and if 
you have 'allowed' it to connect to the web as a browser, the firewall wont block it 
anymore.<br>
Morale: DO NOT use Microsoft explorer, never, use  <a href="tuttiope.htm">a good browser</a> instead.
