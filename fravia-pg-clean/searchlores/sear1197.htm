What is combing?<br>
Combing is a very effective search strategy: instead of simply searching, 
you 'milk' (or 'comb') various other net resources:<br>
</i><prE>
<b><Font color=green>-</Font></b> The continuously updated "Top 100", "Top 1000", "Top whatever" URL-locations
<b><Font color=green> </Font></b> ('Real' combing)
<b><Font color=green>-</Font></b> Usenet newsgroups and their various "vigilant filters" and "short range queries"
<b><Font color=green> </Font></b> (Usenet combing)
<b><Font color=green>-</Font></b> Relevant site links pages.
<b><Font color=green> </Font></b> (a form of 'crumbs gathering', see my anti-smut pages)

<hr><center><Font size=+2><font color=purple>Real combing: The WebSideStory example</fonT></fonT></center>
<br>Best way to learn combing is to have a try by yourself:
Let's take as example (yet there are THOUSAND of these 'top whatever'sites) 
one counter-related site that I have been using myself (it offers quick 
text-only stats and awful graphic stats): WEBSIDE STORY.<br>
Here is websidestory's self-praise:<font color=purple><pre>
Updated every four hours. Last update Mon Nov 3 12:00:01 1997 - PST
WebSideStory, Inc. currently monitors 30,783 sites who have 15,264,666 visitors per day.
There are 22,750 sites listed in 36 categories, averaging 1,996,241 visitors per day.
</prE></fonT> 
The problem with all these 'top whatever' sites is that you oft 
have to wade trough a lot of pages to get where you are interested, 
because the poor sods want you to read their awful ads. <br>
Famous Listing of the Best Sites on the Internet</a><br><br> 
In the case of Websidestory you'll
 for instance first land at http://www.hitbox.com/wc/world.html:<br>
<IMG SRC="images/bulletr.gif" ALT="red" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=13 
HEIGHT=13 BORDER=0 VSPACE=0 
HSPACE=0><a href="http://www.hitbox.com/wc/world.html">WebSideStory's</a> first page
<br> 
Yet you'll eventually land inside this second page (divided by categories):<br>
<IMG SRC="images/bulletr.gif" ALT="red" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=13 
HEIGHT=13 BORDER=0 VSPACE=0 
HSPACE=0><a href="http://www.hitbox.com/wc/world2.html">Websidestory's</a> second page<br>
And here you'll be eventually 
able to choose among the various categories that this counter-related database depot 
has chosen, for 
instance the following ones (I have of course chosen the ones I reckon could yeld some results:<br>

<hr>Now you have seen it...<br>
Obviously combing is an important technique for whatever interest you may 
have, quite effective and pretty  
useful in order to spare an incredible lot of Internet searching <u>hours</u>.
<br><br>
For combing purposes you may also use:
<br>
<font color=red>1</font>) ftp search, looking for "hidden" subdirectories with relevant names  
<br>
	As anybody that knows how to use  
<IMG SRC="images/bulletr.gif" HEIGHT=13 WIDTH=13 ALT= red></a><a href="http://ftpsearch.unit.no/ftpsearch">ftp search</a> ("This server is located in 
Trondheim, Norway")
 already experienced, the ftp search approach (that fishes hidden directories) 
can fish incredible (if tricky to interpret) results.<br> Just do a quick search for 
'warez' and you'll see what I mean.
<hr>


<font color=red>2</fonT>) the "big page provider" search engines</prE>
(Like the search engines that work page specific for geocities at  
<IMG SRC="images/bulletr.gif" ALT="red" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=13 
HEIGHT=13 BORDER=0 VSPACE=0 
HSPACE=0><a href="http://www.geocities.com/search/">http://www.geocities.com/search/</a>  
or for mygale, or for angelfire, or for fortunecity, or for chez, or for you name one 
of the thousand existing free pages providers that have specific search engines)
<hr width=33%>
<center>
There are THOUSAND of 'top whatever' counters and many carry some form 
of 'top side listing' within... you may want to examine a list with 
MANY counters on this good page: <IMG SRC="images/bulletr.gif" ALIGN=BOTTOM BORDER=0 VSPACE=0

<br>
Usenet combing can work "on the fly" or "regularly" through the "Vigilant" 
 filter at<br><pre>
filter@vigilant.bc.ca</pre>
I'll show you for instance one of my favourite simple queries:<pre>
FIND how-to-search tutorial manual
		NOT spam
		NOT top position
		NOT advertising
		MAX 8</pre>
Such a query would give you useful information about "searching techniques" on 
the Web, you may of course construct how many queries you like and *register* 
(for free) by the vigilant filter, in order to get 
the results of your usenet queries emailed to you every day or week or 
month.<br><br>  



<center><h3><b>The vigilant robot</b></h3></center>
Learn the secrets of usenet FILTERING! Email
<u>filter@vigilant.bc.ca</u> with
 the word "help" inside BOTH subject and text
 and learn how to use it as soon as you get vigilant's
automated answer... this robot
 is capable of sending you automatically ALL usenet
messages that contain
 the wording that you have chosen... vigilant is NOT a
usenet depot, like Dejavu or
 reference.com... vigilant will send you (obviously for
free) "on-the-fly" all usenet
 messages that transit around dealing with matters that
may interest you, at times
 inside newsgroups you do not even know the names of...
to master well its filter
 capabilities is quite
  tricky though... study it and use it... you'll never
regret it and I'm sure you'll

there other "vigilant" services? This is another of the

You'll use it a lot, it allows you to reconstruct a

as somebody uses newsgroups (like all do). As a matter

really useful to snoop what's going on and where are the sites

translated in 'let other people do the searches for me...": you'll 
simply find email snippets of people that has found the solution to your 
query inside some 
usenet group you do not even know the name of!<br>

Usenet queries that can be done through the two big Usenet "depots": 
Dejanews 
and 
email query, are possible ALSO through the major search engines (if you know 
how to use them) and using the 'klebing' techniqe explained below:<bR>
Many of the main search engines allow such querying 
too, and they use (of course) the services of either Dejanews or emailquery.

NOTE THAT THERE ARE MANY MORE 'usenet-depot'... I recently found an 'italian' 
one at <IMG SRC="images/bulletr.gif" HEIGHT=13

<HR  SIZE=2>&nbsp;
<CENTER><Font size=+2><FONT COLOR=purple>__klebing__</FONT></fonT></CENTER>
<center>Fishing query strings and locations</center><br>
Klebing is a 'reversing search' technique that goes ways beyond 
"combing". And which offers incredible value. We will clear out 
what klebing is, below, using a ready made example on a site 
that you'll probably already know (it is an important hacker site and I link
  to it myself inside  
my <a href="links.htm">links</a> page):	here is the 'normal' 
URL of that site: <IMG SRC="images/bulletr.gif" ALIGN=BOTTOM BORDER=0 VSPACE=0
HSPACE=0><A HREF="http://l0pht.com/">L0pht  heavy
industries</A>.<br> We can use LOpht for this example because LOpht 
has (publicly) the 'row material' that we need for klebing: the 'remote connexions' list.
It is basically a very 
simple 	CGI-script, that updates inside its own database (LOpht updates every day) 
all the "remote" URL locations (i.e. the sites the various visitors come from) accessing any of the pages of a given site. 
<br>You may easily write such an analogouus spider and add 
it to your site! In order to write quickly (and dirty) 
a 'crude' CGI-script like this you 
just need to list all the 
<font color=purple>var where = document.referrer</fonT> variables that any 
lamer's browser carries inside (well... not our reversed and 'ameliorated' 
browsers... in order to learn the relevant techniques you may want to have 
a look at Mammon_'s <a href="mammop5.htm">Reversing Netscape's buttons and 
menus</a> essay... my copy of Netscape carries for instance a different random 
-and of course faked- <font color=purple>document.referrer</font> variable everytime it accesses a new 
site :-)<br><br>
Well, have a look at the next link and you'll understand what I mean:<br>
Here you have the real, updated LOpht's location you'll use yourself 
in order to perform your updated klebing endeavours: 
<IMG SRC="images/bulletr.gif" ALIGN=BOTTOM BORDER=0 VSPACE=0
HSPACE=0><a href="http://www.l0pht.com/ref.html">http://www.l0pht.com/ref.html</a><br><br>

And here you have a copy of it that you should examine 
NOW in order to better follow what I'm telling you.<br>
 In order to  
discuss together with you some of the 'results' of 
our klebing activities I have copied a 'still image' of this 
continuously updating database inside my site, talen from the location 
above 
on 4 Nov 1997 (to-day), here it is: 
<IMG SRC="images/bulletr.gif" ALIGN=BOTTOM BORDER=0 VSPACE=0
HSPACE=0><a href="https://searchlores.nickifaulk.com/lophtrev.htm">lophtrev.htm</a><br>
<br>
So, now that you had a look at them, let's say a couple of things:<br>
<font color=red>1</fonT>)	The utility of such a script from the Webmaster's point of view 
is obvious: he can immediately see 
WHO is sending hits to him and WHERE inside his site does he link to (and 
he can 'punish' eventual  
'fastidious' linking inside his site simply modifying 
the <u>name</u> of the branched 
pages, like I'll do soon with the academy section of my site if you keep entering from the 
sides to my pages :-(
<br>
<font color=red>2</font>)	The utility of such a script (if publicly presented, like 
this by LOpht, or else 
if 'somehow' findbar inside a /cgi subdirectory -see my antismut pag for the 
relevant CGI-cracking techniques :-) is for our search purposes HUGE! If the site 
has some attinence with fields you are interested in (and LOphts for sure 
has it with sites that may interest us!) 
you are in for a surprise... in fact one wonders what's the point 
of laboriously browsing the web in search of possible new intersting 
sites where you could eventually learn something! Let 
those same sites COME TO YOU all by themselves alone... isn't it nice?
<br><bR>

In fact, what do we have here?	  <br>
Let's have a look at some intersting little fishes:<br>
Yahoo and excite for instance, find both this site through the cdc cult<br>
<font color=purple>
1409  |  http://www.yahoo.com/Society_and_Culture/Religion/Humor/Parody_Religions/Cult_of_the_Dead_Cow/ -> /cdc.html<br>
 125  |  http://www.excite.com/search.gw?trace=1&search=hackers -> /cdc.html<br>
</font>
'our' astalavista is also present:<br>
<font color=purple>
124  |  http://astalavista.box.sk/cgi-bin/marek/robot/robot?srch=warez -> /lounge.html<br>
</font>
Note thet there is already something that may be interesting for you (albeit 
well known by all search-experts): the <font color=red>FORM</fonT> that an 
excite or astalavista query takes!<bR>
Yes, if you have read my previous letters, you'll have seen that it is possible 
to query search engines per email using URL addresses like:<br><font color=purple>  
http://lycos11.lycos.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/flpursuit?first=1\\&maxhits=30\\
&minterms=1\\&minscore=0.01\\&terse=standard\\&query=linguistic+phenomena         
</fonT><br>
Therefore we have here a simple 'template' that we can immediatly use for OTHER
queries... c'mon: try it out: cut and paste the following line:<br>
<font color=purple>http://www.excite.com/search.gw?trace=1&search=hackers</fonT><br>
that we have found through our klebing work, and paste it inside the 'location' 
window of your copy of navigator...<bR>
Have you done it?<br>
Well, now backspace over <font color=purple>hackers</font> and digit instead 
<font color=purple>crackers</font><br>.
Now press enter and have a look: your own ready-made excite search string!<br>
And youll find THOUSAND of powerful and frequent or funny and seldom used 
'query string' possibilities trough 
this klebing method... d'you understand now how POWERFUL this can be?
<hr> <center>
<fon size=+2>New strings</fonT></center>   
Back to our klebing page... as you can see, in order to land 
somewhere at LOft a part of these visitors has used Yahoo and has 
searched for 'hackers', 'attress', 'spycamera' and more<br>
Now, some of these are banal, like 'hackers', yet some are quite 
interesting, like 'email intercepting'.<br>
This can also be quite interesting... I have quite a lot of ready-made 
strings that I use with the search engines, and some of them I have gathered 
klebing sites... else I would probably never have come to some ideas.
<hr> <center>
<fon size=+2>Watch the watchers</fonT></center> 
Some of our enemies have sites somewhere that tehy use to check us... it may 
be quite interesting to snoop onto those sites... through klebing you'll get 
them... have a look at what we have here at LOpht:<br>  
    316  |  http://www.microsoft.com/security/ntprod.htm -> /advisories.html<br>
103  |  http://www.microsoft.com/security/issues.htm -> /advisories.html<br>

<hr> <center>
<fon size=+2>Unknown mysteries</fonT></center>   
 This one links to a cgi-bin page... why?:<br> 
<font color=purple> 
  105  |  http://nowhere/nothing.html -> /cgi-bin/Count.cgi<br>
</font>
well, this tells us<br>
 FIRST<br>
 That there is indeed a cgi-bin directory here with a Count.cgi script and<br>
 SECOND<br>
 that <font color=purple>nowhere/nothing</fonT> is interested in it.<br>
<hr> <center>
<fon size=+2>Old friends</fonT></center>   

 And who the hell is this next one? Our good old friend Bokler from Deja? (See my 
<a href="https://searchlores.nickifaulk.com/deja.htm">deja.htm</a> page)</br>
<font color=purple> 
 14  |  http://spider.bokler.com/bokler/crak_body.html -> /index.htm<br>
</font>
<hr>
 Well... rich fishing, isn't it?  <hr>
 And the following ones could be interesting too, don't you believe?<br>
<font color=purple> 
106  |  http://astalavista.box.sk/cgi-bin/marek/robot/robot?srch=warez&submit=+search+ -> /lounge.html<br>
114  |  http://netfind.aol.com/search.gw<br> 
</fonT>
 Yes, when you start klebing, you never finish off experimenting! :-)

 <br>
 Go ahead, enjoy!<br><br>
