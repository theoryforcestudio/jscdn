<H2>How to walk the 'net without kicking yourself
later...</H2></CENTER>

<H4>this FAQ began when the above remark was posted by somebody on
the Seekers' MB as an idea for an article. I thought about it a lot
and for  a long time. Yes, a simple FAQ on "<font color=blue>how to behave</font>" while online
certainly is needed. Slowly, it began to take shape. This is the
first draft, by all means incomplete.</H4></p><p>

 <font size=+1>
----Lots of people talkin'. None listenin'....  (was it SVD who said
that?)</p><p>


So far I have only seen article talking about securing your
privacy by technological means. What about psychology and human
behavior? I will try to answer the question on how to present
yourself online.</p><p>

Of course, remember the very basics. Never ever give ANY real
personal information - your name, address (even general living area
such as city or state), SSN, personal details (married, single),
occupation, income,  interests, etc to any strangers online. This
is especially true when filling up forms for free soft or/and
registering for free services unless you want to be flooded with
hundreds of spam emails daily. Listen to your inner voice and
trust your instincts. They are usually right. If something doesn't
feel right or sounds fake, it most likely is.  If you are in a
chat room and something or someone is making you uncomfortable,
discontinue the chat. If possible, when buying stuff online pay
with money order instead of Credit Card.</p><p>



<P>Millions of us are now online. Each one of us is different,
with our own sets of believe systems, knowledge, understanding (or
miss-understanding) of how the world works, personalities, moods,
sense of humor. We are all online for different reasons too. So
it's NOT surprising when we meet somebody online who doesn't share
our believes, or maybe our outlook on different subjects, or
somebody who may not like what we say, or what we may do online
and we end up getting in a huge flame war with them or something
worse. After all, we can barely tolerate the idiots we are
surrounded by in "real life" and their stupidity, so what's left
for some moron online who is a pompous idiot and thinks he/she knows
everything, right?</p><p>

<A NAME="basic"></a>
<H3>Basic tips</H3>

of course are to <U>never</U> give <U>any</U> real info  about
yourself, name, location, address, credit card, especially if you
are in a sensitive chat-room, or BBS, MB, Usenet, etc. Before
visiting any place online, think about what you are trying to
get out of it. Are you looking for real knowledge, or to kill some
time having a few laughs?<br>
Modify your behavior accordingly. Be wary of quick friendships and
of people agreeing with everything you say, or with people fishing
for personal info. Do they have your best interests at heart? Ask
yourself this questions: would you trust them with your life, your
security, your personal information and possessions or your kids?
What do you <U>really</U> know about them besides a "nick-name"
and a few facts <U>they</U> told you? Do they appear too eager, or
maybe they visit daily and stay in  that chat-room for hours and
hours? Are they there in the middle of the day (their time)? We all
know <U>both</U> crooks, cops and "wannabie crooks and cops" 
populate the 'Net looking for the
gullible and naive. Think about these things.<BR>
<BR>



<A NAME="avatars"></a>
<H3>Avatars or Who IS the real you??</H3>
First thing you need to do is create several different
personalities (<a href="stalking.htm">"avatars"</a> in Fravia's term) for 
use online. You may
call it lying, I call it protecting myself. Each personality comes
equipped  with their own "nick-name", comes from a different
country, has a whole separate life history and story, uses
specific behavior patterns, ways of expressing themselves, and has
different likes, dislikes and trust levels. Each personality
should employ different speech patterns (laak me -a- speakin' d'awn
sout' American English I learn'd from readin' Huck Finn in da
original), different reactions to stimuli, different interests.
Use your imagination here. Make them of several age groups, and
different nationalities. Learning a few dozen words in another
language and using them sparingly can certainly be helpful, or if
English is your natural language, make glaring grammatical and
spelling mistakes. Each nick should reflect the personality of the
user. I have found out using  humorous nicks makes people laugh
and like you more. While participating in a chat room, MB or BBS
use the main personality to post remarks, the lesser personality
to ask questions that may be  deemed silly or stupid and a 3rd
personality to post links for example. Remember, <U>do not</U>
come online or post when under the influence of drugs or alcohol.
I have seen many idiotic posts where the person later came and
apologized saying: "Duuh, please ignore what I said, I was on ______
at the time" (fill in the blank with your favorite drug of
choice).</p><p>

While on the net, I change and rotate personalities, nicknames,
sex, age, languages more than I change my socks in "real" life! I
have and use several nicks (males and females) according to what I
am doing right at the moment and what message board or chat room I
am in. Believe it not, but some men are still stupid enough to
fall for the olde "I'm a bisexual female and I'm very weird."
trick. Sex still regains supreme and men are still too ridiculously
tied up by their hormones to think straight. [for a great and
revealing look at personalities online read the great Pat
Cadigan's "Tea from an Empty Cup." cyberpunk sci-fi book].</p><p>
This said, even when rotating personalities and avatars, 
remember that there are <a href="lanpat.htm">techniques</a> that 
aim to 
catch you&nbsp;:-)


</p><p>
<BR>

<A name="chatrooms"></a>
<H3>Using chat rooms, IRCs, message boards and/or BBS:</H3>

Armed with the avatar of your choice, you can now visit chat room
or message boards or even IRC. But hold on there!</p><p>

When visiting a new chatroom or message board begin by simply
"lurking" there for a while. Do not post, but simply study the
established members and observe their interactions with one
another. Each place has an established "pecking order" of sorts. It
always has a leader or two, somebody who everyone looks up to,
somebody who is the most knowledgeable. They always give the best
advice and are always calm and rational, even in the face of the
worst trolls. After them come the administrators, and the
helpers.</p><p>

The administrators will kick your skin outta IRC if you misbehave
there. The Administrator will
take care of the message boards or the chat rooms. They may even
remove posts they deem not relevant and post that are obviously
abusive and off topic. The clever trolls will immediately began to
scream: "CENSORSHIP!" but hey, that's administrators' job after
all. Learn to live with it.</p><p>

The helpers are the one who will answer questions and give free
advice. They do all this work for free, so be nice to them, ok? Of
course, sometimes <a href="trolls.htm">trolls</a> will use a helper's nick and might even
try to impersonate the "good guys".</p><p>

Let's look at the technical aspects of chatrooms, IRC and message
boards. Do they show your real IP number when you are there and/or
when you post? Make sure you are anonymous by using a proxy
and/or some IP spoofing. IRCs are notorious for being totally insecure
when using them. Most chat-room, MB and BBS use counters to count
how many people access them, so turn your images off because most
counters work that way. Do they also employ cookies (most
likely - <U>everyone</U> uses them today)? How about Java, or
JavaScript? Turn all that stuff OFF when visiting!</p><p>



"Measure twice, but cut once." the wise tailor said. Think
carefully over your words <U>before</U> you post them. Can
somebody misunderstand what you are trying to say? (my bad English
sometimes makes it quite difficult for me to express myself
articulately) Remember, words by themselves are dry and
impersonal, easily taken for something else, while in a face to
face communication facial expressions and <a href="realicra/rebodila.htm">body language</a> plays a
big part.  Sarcasm, humor, jokes can easily be miss-interpreted.
What "humor" is, differs widely from country to country.</p><p>

</p><p>

<A NAME="instant"></a>
<H3>Instant Message Utilities</H3>
are extremely popular these days. Millions use ICQ (I Seek
You), Trillion, Microsoft Messanger, AIM, and so on. Learn how to
set them up correctly. Only give your numbers to people who you
really trust and not to everyone. Instant Message Utilities are
definitely NON secure and they will reveal your IP number. Also, it is
easy to get seriously hacked through ICQ.</p><p>
<BR>


<a name="usenet"></a>
<H3>While on Usenet:</H3>
I have met the biggest morons on Usenet, because its free and
uncontrolled nature makes it a prime target for a place to be for
all sorts of major idiots. Usenet is way better than WWW, anyway,
you can find as much info on <U>any</U> subject there as on WWW,
and it also has tons of free stuff
just waiting for you to find it and d/l it...~_^. All of the above,
 strongly applies to Usenet too, and even more. Worse, lots of
so called "politically-correct nazis" today just LOVE to get a knee
jerk over the smallest excuse and can get "offended" when somebody
uses ordinary words they have deemed "racist", "offensive",
"degrading", and all sorts of other "policorrean" definitions.</p><p>

For example I was  recently  assaulted by a bunch of
morons having used the words "fat" and "ugly" to describe several
fat and ugly women. Things got so bad because I ignored my own
good advices and got into 10 arguments with 10 different people at
the same time, some of those politically-correct fanatics
even began urging people to contact my news server and complain.
Luckily, either my news-server simply ignored them or they weren't
as organized as they thought they were. Either way I am
<U>still</U> using that news server ^_^.

</p><p><BR>
<BR>

<A name="arguments"></a>
<H3>Are arguments worth getting into?</H3>
<P> Sadly, many times you can't really change people and their mind, nor teach
them something. They simply won't listen to you, so your time will
be wasted if you try to argue with them and all you get is
sadness. For example, Americans are very good debater I found
out. They even take
debate classes in their schools, so it's hard to argue with them.
You have to be quick and think fast on your feet with them.
But they are hampered because they
think they are the best, and the rest of the world is just some
"3rd world country" without in-house plumbing. Sadly, their
"politically-correctness" movement has penetrated into the rest of
the world, making it eerily similar to George Orwell's 1984
double-speak. They get "offended" to the point of becoming
"language inspectors", and every discussion wird "controversial".
Americans are always deciding what's wrong and what's right,
forgetting that anything is (mostly) relative, depending from the 
position of the
observer.</p><p>

Remember, there will always be people out there who will try to
provoke you, especially if you are online doing something
<U>they</U> have deemed evil, obscene, indecent or even just annoying. They are simply
itching for a fight. Ignore them. These people are NOTHING else than
wannabie trolls and that's <U>all</U> they will be. Simply stay away from
them, for you don't really want to inspire them to return and 
they <U>will</U> return, often enough with reinforcements in the
form of their friends and minions. (tip: the "<font color=blue>SCRIPT</font>" and
"<font color=blue>/SCRIPT</font>" HTML tags can be <U>very</U> helpful if you know how to
use them on a MB ~_^!)
<br><br>
Most arguments in MBs or BBS or on Usenet cannot be properly
explained anyway, for the simple reasons they:
<UL><LI> <U>do not</U> happen in real time thus rendering them
quite hard  to manage
<LI>people tend to drift from the main point they were trying to
make into details or name calling
<LI>arguing is <a href="trolls.htm#troscho">an art in itself</a>, but when 
was the last time you
met somebody who knew how to do it properly using correct
deductive VS inductive arguments and True/False statements? (yeah,
I <U>thought</U> so)</UL>

Take the case of Linux VS Windoze for example. Yes, Windoze is
very easy to use, specially designed to be for the average (or
below average intelligence) person. Yes, Windoze's  easy use has
nurtured the explosive growth of the Internet. But so what? Linux
nowadays includes the K Desktop Environment which is as easy to
use as Windoze, actually much easier. With Linux, you have the
freedom of knowing <U>exactly</U> what is going on with your
system, and Linux is cheaper to buy, use and
maintain and most of the apps are free of charge too. So if
somebody tells you about Windoze's benefits, just listen to them
and them tell them: "Well, that's all fine and good, but your
arguments are nothing but words in the final run. Linux is
definitely better than Windoze in many aspects and I can list
them."</p><p>

<P>Confronting people directly is the <U>worst</U> thing you can
do. Take your time first and observe them. Read their responses,
watch their reactions. Do this for a week or for a month if
necessary.</p><p>

<A NAME=email>
<H3>Free e-mail services</H3>
Yahoo, Opera, Microsoft and many others offer "free email
addresses" that you can use and give to online friends instead of
your "real" email. Here are some more companies offering "free
email services: <A  href="https://www.PrivacyX.com">https://www.PrivacyX.com</A>, 
<a href="http://www.ziplip.com">http://www.ziplip.com</a>, 
<a href="http://www.1on1mail.com">http://www.1on1mail.com</a>,
<a href="http://www.myownemail.com">http://www.myownemail.com</a>,
<a href="http://www.hushmail.com/">http://www.hushmail.com/</a> and
so on. This is only a short list. Use them. Of course, when
filling the information, and always lie like a mattress. (the same applies
when filling up forms for free soft or/and registering for ANY
free services). Last time I was from Israel. Before that I was
from Shri Lanka. The funkier the names the better too. I get
really creative there, but not <U>too</U> creative as to stand
out. Arabic sounding names are a no-no-no right now. Of-course I also
only use such services for a limited period of time. I change them every
year or as often as needed. It's still amazing to me how many
spammers find me, though. If they can find me <U>so easily</U> what about
the rest of the world I wonder??</p><p>
<BR>




<A NAME="personal"></a>
<H3>Personal relationships online</H3>
Let' me tell you from experience, people sure behave differently
online. I dunno what it is, mebbe it's the <U>illusion of
privacy</U> or something, but people really let EVEYTHING hang out
online. I have been told secrets people will never tell me in
"real life" or  face to face.<br>
So let's say you met somebody online who was really "cool and
interesting" and you wanna develop some kind of friendship with them. How do
you start?</p><p>

First, you must go slow. Don't head rush into anything and you
won't get hurt. Think about what you want to get out of the
"friendship". Is it for fun, or do you share similar interests, or
is it for a little bit of, AHEM, cybersex ^_~??
<br>
Begin by giving them that throw-away email Hotmail or Yahoo email
address.</p><p>
Test them. Do they make sense when talking?</p><p>

If the relationship doesn't work out, tell the person in no
uncertain terms NOT to contact you anymore. Tell them you do not
wish to communicate with them anymore. Do not accept their emails.
if they are one of your contact on ICQ place them in your
invisible folder, so they won't know when you are online anymore.


<HR>


Final tips:   Learn how the Internet works  and apply that
knowledge when online. Technical know-how is a wonderful weapon, 
actually a whole quiver full of weapons, 
and it can probably save your skin.
