<h2 align="left">Introduction</h2>
<p align="justify">Searchers usually have a fairly good idea of what
they want to search, but words often have several meanings, or are used
in several contexts, and spammers and SEOs take advantage of that to
push their crap, by building pages tangentially related with your
search terms, hoping that you would click on the ads crammed on those
pages. Of course we can exclude the main keywords pertaining to the
contexts we do not want, although that is easier said than done.
</p>
<p align="justify">
The purpose of this essay is to give you the means of finding those excluding keywords 
in a fairly 
easy way, in order to get ride of the spammed results on your own, without any 
need to trust the anti-spamming algos used by the search engines themselves.
The idea is to <font color="blue">reverse the SEO-spammers approach</font> and build a list 
of the most common terms appearing in the spammed search results, 
with their relative frequency, so that you can spot at once the most spammed, and hence 
the <b>most unwanted</b> 
keywords for your query.
</p>
<p align="justify">
You can do just that at the <a href="oracle.htm">Seekers' Oracle</a>,
which builds a list of the most common terms appearing in the spammed
search results, with their relative frequency, by using web or image
[for each image, Yahoo offers a <a href="alltheweb.htm#intermediate">snippet of text around the image</a>]
search APIs. For those interested in knowing how the tool was made, view my essay <a href="json.htm">JSON for the masses</a>; for the others, just use it.
</p>
<a name="quarry"></a>
<h2>Our quarry</h2>
<p align="justify">
I guess that you are reading this essay because you want to learn <b>web search strategies</b>. To get better results it is better to expand our query adding some terms. You can do it by yourself or using <a href="oracle.htm">our tool</a> to get terms frequency tables:
</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li><a href="yahoo-web.htm" name=yahoo-web>web</a>: web, find, internet, tips, searching, documents, file, tip, files, document;
<li><a href="yahoo-search.htm" name=yahoo-search>search</a>: internet, tips;
<li><a href="yahoo-strategies.htm" name=yahoo-strategies>strategies</a>: search, strategy, web, internet, tips, techniques, files;
</ul>
</div>
<p align="justify">
or using online tools to get synonyms such as:
</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn">WordNet</a>
<li><a href="http://www.synomizer.com/">Synomizer</a>
<li><a href="http://dico.isc.cnrs.fr/dico/en/search">English Synonym Dictionary</a>
<li><a href="http://www.synonym.com/synonym/">Antonym Finder and Synonym Thesaurus -- Synonyms and definitions for English words!</a>
</ul>
</div>
<p align="justify">Given that, our query can be expanded to the following one:
</p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#0022ff">(search OR searching OR seek OR seeking) AND
(web OR internet OR document OR documents OR file OR files OR webpage
OR webpages OR "web page" OR "web pages") AND (tips OR hints OR
strategies)</font>
</blockquote>

<p align="justify">In the good ol' days, before <a href="http://searchengineshowdown.com/features/av/">AltaVista</a>'s
demise, it was easy to refine this query, because we also have a fairly
good idea of search terms proximity: --(search, searching, seek,
seeking) and (web, internet, document, documents, file, files, webpage,
webpages, web page, web pages) for grammatical reasons should be quite
close one another, lets say at maximum 2, 3 words away; whereas the
context terms (tips, hints, strategies) should gravitate in the
neighborhood of the previous two sets, lets say at maximum 50 words
away--. Thanks to AltaVista flawless support of boolean operators,
distributive NEAR operator and variable size proximity search before
AltaVista's demise, it were possible to use the following query </p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#0022ff">(search OR searching OR seek OR seeking) within
3 (web OR internet OR document OR documents OR file OR files OR webpage
OR webpages OR "web page" OR "web pages") within 50 (tips OR hints OR
strategies)</font>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">
Nowadays <a href="http://www.exalead.com/">exalead</a> (variable size proximity search) and <a href="http://search.yahoo.com">Yahoo</a>
(fixed(?) size proximity search) are the ones which are closer, but
they still have flaws concerning distributive NEAR operator or variable
size proximity search... so there's no way of using the <b>cloud search strategy</b>,
which is quite unfortunate, because nowadays search results are
polluted by big documents which, by chance or design, have our search
terms. The best we can is excluding terms.
</p>
<a name="statistics"></a>
<h2>Word statistics</h2>
<p align="justify">
We start our analysis by spotting the most troublesome terms for our expanded query using <a href="oracle.htm">our tool</a>
and inserting each search term one by one in order to get the most
unwanted terms clinging to our query with their respective frequency. I
only show words appearing ten or more times:

<p align="justify">It's interesting to compare the idiosyncrasies of
each keyword... words are not made equal, even synonyms! Lets squeeze
all this information and get the list of our own stopwords.

<h2>Stop words</h2>
<p align="justify">
With the exception of <a href="http://www.exalead.com/">exalead</a>,
all other search engines only allow a more or less limited amount of
keywords per query, so our list is sorted and split by main offenders /
quarry specific offenders and for each category I have chosen the
keywords which offered the biggest bang with the least amount of
gunpowder and collateral damages.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><b>Main offenders</b>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><b>business</b>: business, service, services, buy, price, products, shop, shopping, product, store.

99% of search results is weeped out by excluding these troublesome

ubiquitous and excluding them in other search queries often cuts quite
some mustard. Lets see an example for a research I made a long time ago

where some keywords were not excluded, as they might have significant
collateral damages (buy, price, travel, god, church, legal, law):

specific offenders (genealogy, for instance), the previous set is
