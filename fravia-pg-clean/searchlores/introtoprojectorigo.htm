<font size=+1>
 I have decided to give my own lasting contribution to the web. 
  Just an attempt, anyway. Might as well throw it up in the air to see how well it gets shot down.<br><br>
Fittingly with my <a target=_top href="http://www.searchlores.org/whoiam.htm">past studies</a>, my contribution 
will consist in the accurate scanning of some great early medieval
sources. I have decided, to begin
with,  to spread into the deep Web the complete collated  version of the <font
color=blue>Origo Gentis Langobardorum</font>, that I have 
 scanned from Georg Waitz's "massgebende" (authoritative) edition, in MGH
(Monumenta Germaniae Historica)
 SSrrLang (Scriptores rerum Langobardicarum et Italicarum saec.
VI-IX), Hannover 1878. This text was not available on the web (until now) together with its fundamental footnotes and variants.   
<br><br>

<font color="#0080ff">Added Juny 2006: There's now a "<a href="http://www.dmgh.de/">digital Monumenta Germaniae Historica</a>" site with a scanned reproduction of 
Waitz, Georg: Scriptores rerum Langobardicarum et Italicarum saec. VI-IX, Hannover 1878.  You may begin at 
<a href="http://mdz1.bib-bvb.de/~db/bsb00000858/images/index.html?seite=2">Page 2</a> and play the number game with the URL. The Origo 
begins       at <a href="http://mdz1.bib-bvb.de/~db/bsb00000858/images/index.html?seite=9">page 9</a> 
(<a href="http://mdz1.bib-bvb.de/~db/bsb00000858/images/bsb00000858_00009.jpg">here</a> the complete scanned image).</font>

 <br><br>The importance of giving <font color=blue>anybody</font>
full access to <font color=blue>THE</font>  authoritative editions 
 of all fundamental sources for medieval -and more generally historical- studies doesn't need
much underlining:  Seeking the
 web (or perusing most universities' libraries) you can and will  find
-&nbsp;Alas!&nbsp; -
only 
<a target=_top href="http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/anonymus/origo_lang.html">superficial</a>, 
<a target=_top href="http://www.oeaw.ac.at/gema/lango_origo.htm">almost</a>
<a target=_top href="http://www.melegnano.net/spie0007a.htm">useless</a>, <a target=_top href="http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/origo.html">editions</a> of the original 
latin texts... provided 
 you'll find latin editions at all, since most (so-called)
"universities" now teach history of
the middle ages using just  <a href="https://searchlores.nickifaulk.com/intrototheorigo.htm#englishtranslation">translations</a> instead than 
 <a
href="ORIGOGENTISLANGOBARDORUMWAITZ.htm">the real</a> collated texts.<br>To-day
universities are, at least for early medieval studies,
 in a phase of complete decadence: incompetent teachers and an absolute
lack of
 basic knowledge wherever you look. In fact the average university of today is, from a knowledge and competence point of view, in a situation waaay
 worse than any average "gymnasium" from 150 years ago&nbsp;:-(<br>150 years ago 
 a good gymnasium professor -geschweige denn a university professor- knew latin, greek and maybe Sanskrit as well: 
 today university professors, in comparison, don't know shit from shinola.
 <br>
 <br>Take, for instance, the names variants  in the footnotes of any
authoritative edition of the sources (like this very <a
href="ORIGOGENTISLANGOBARDORUMWAITZ.htm">Origo Gentis Langobardorum</a> now in your hands): such variants 
 possess an incredible importance, especially
 when trying to understand which may have been the correct
spelling of a given name, since names
  are among the words most prone to errors when copying: the copists
imprecisions being 
 due to the linguistic and historical gap vis-à-vis the events they are
writing down. Imagine what 
 you yourself would actually write down, if someone would suddendly dictate for  
 you  a list of -say- medieval polish names&nbsp;:-) <br>
 Unfortunately today "historians" often enough do not really *use* (nor mostly would know how to use) the authoritative sources. 
 Ok, they do cite them allright, since they "must" be cited, but they seldom use them. Yet sources (massgebende Quellen) must 
  not only be just regularly used, but rather thoroughly "squeezed", in order to extract out of them even their lightest and smallest hints, each one 
  of which is more worth than a 200 pages long 'trendy' secondary study.
 <br><br>
Once again, names and names variants are for the early medieval centuries (and, come to think of it, <a href="nomomen.htm">for today's web</a> 
as well), one of the very few historical crumbs we may be able <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&hl=en&lr=&q=F%C3%B6rstemann%3A+Altdeutsches+Namenbuch%2C+Bd.+1%3A+Personennamen&btnG=Search">to chew</a>. 
Their importance, 
especially for the historical timespan described in the Origo, is paramount. For, in the early 
middle ages, Parchment (Pergamene, Pergament, Parchemin, Pergamena) was used, which 
 is somehow similar to the web-bytes I'm writing this onto:  it is in fact <font color=blue>re-writable</font>! 
 Yup, scripts may disappear, not unlike our ephemerical web of bytes! <br>
 You can indeed scratch a parchment text
-with a stone- back to white, deleting (almost completely) the original text -or any previous writing- in the process. That's the reason 
so few early medieval sources have survived. And the Origo is one of those few.<br> 
The story of the Longobards is  but an example. But a very interesting one: Once you have read the Origo, 
 (together of course with at least the Codex Gothanus and Paul's Historia Langobardorum)  you will know almost 
 <font color=blue>as much as anyone else can</font> 
 about a decisive historical span of almost 300 years, over an area as big as half Europe.<br> The 
problems will begin when you'll try to squeeze such few lines into a coherent interpretation&nbsp;:-)<br>
<br>But even the six pages of the Origo alone will allow us to gather rock-solid data with some simple exegesis techniques, as I hope to show.
For these reasons I might soon or later 
add to this edition of Waitz's Origo  an <font color="#0080ff">introduction to the Origo</font> that I will
 write down and whose purpose, as stated, will not only  be to 
 "<font color=blue>illustrate some basic text exegesis techniques</font>", which were as useful yesterday, as they are today and will be tomorrow, 
 but also "<font color=blue>to spread old half-forgotten lore in times of decadence</font>", 
teaching how history of the early middle ages <font color=blue>should</font>  be studied (but, alas, isn't). 
<br><br>
For instance the Origo has only six pages, but six pages of historical primary DATA, not of opinions of somebody that may - or may not- 
have read the sources and their variants. 
Armed with such DATA,  you yourself will be able to check, or confute any historical interpretation of those times, or even 
propose a new (and probably rather solid) one. Welcome to concrete "hard bricks" history.
<br><br>
 Of course when I published this I was aware of
the fact that the
Monumenta Germaniae (MGH) themselves
have   decided to scan and publish all the sources, and have promised to do
so before 2010. So sooner or later Waitz's work would have been published on the web anyway.  
<br><br> 

    <font color="#0080ff">Added Juny 2006: There's now a "<a href="http://www.dmgh.de/">digital Monumenta Germaniae Historica</a>" site with a scanned reproduction of 
Waitz, Georg: Scriptores rerum Langobardicarum et Italicarum saec. VI-IX, Hannover 1878.  You may begin at 
<a href="http://mdz1.bib-bvb.de/~db/bsb00000858/images/index.html?seite=2">Page 2</a> and play the number game with the URL. The Origo 
begins       at <a href="http://mdz1.bib-bvb.de/~db/bsb00000858/images/index.html?seite=9">page 9</a> 
(<a href="http://mdz1.bib-bvb.de/~db/bsb00000858/images/bsb00000858_00009.jpg">here</a> the complete scanned image).</font>
<br>
<br>There is an added reason to publish this despite the real MGH publication: some of these good-starting
entreprises seem to turn soon or later into just another crippled 
<a target=_top href="http://www.mgh.de/dmgh.htm">commercial project</a>,
similar to the project some clowns developed, through Proquest, for <a target=_top href="http://www.proquest.co.uk/products/pld.html">Migne's
Patrologia latina</a>. Often on the web a series of broad public initiative become 'cannibalized' by commercial vultures.<br><br>

While I'm confident that soon or later all important medieval
sources will be
freely available on the web (legally or illegally&nbsp;:-) I'm at
the same time
worried that the beastly commercial morons may want to call
the rules of the game, and -as usual- choose irrelevant crap over fundamental
texts. Hence  I am gladly throwing  two "perennial" cents of mine 
into
their grinding wheels.<br>
Since no copyright whatsoever can be imposed on books edited in
1878, I have decided to
publish these texts myself brevi manu :-P
 <br><br>I have decided to port everything to plain good ole
 HTML, respectintg the original edition formattings by Waitz.
Read, or Print, and enjoy, it's now free for all!<br><br>Don't forget
that the punctuation
is from Waitz, and does
NOT appear, of course, inside the original codici. <br>This is important:  the position <u>of a single comma</u> may
change everything!
As Sielaff pointed out, the following passage from the Origo (later used by Paul  for
his Historia): "<font color=blue>...et nomen secundae Walderada, quam
habuit uxorem Scusuald rex Francorum, quam odio
habens, tradidit eam Garipald in uxorem. Filia regis Herulorum
tertiam uxorem habuit
nomen Silinga; de ipsa habuit filium nomine Waltari...</font>" can
be read
differently if we just change Waitz's punctuation and use a
different (and probably more solid</i>&nbsp;:-)<i> variant:
"<font color=blue>...et nomen secundae Walderada, quam habuit uxorem
Scusuald rex Francorum, quam odio
habens, tradidit eam Garipald in uxorem, filio regis Herulorum.
Tertiam uxorem habuit
nomen Silinga; de ipsa habuit filium nomine Waltari...</font>"
("Filio", instead of "filia" in the
codex Matritensis, see <a href="ORIGOGENTISLANGOBARDORUMWAITZ.htm#pag4">Waitz edition</a>, and note that the possibility of a direct connection between 
Erules and Bavarians is not *that* far-fetched: the Langobards conquered the Erules in 505 ~ 512 and occupied 
Bohemia immediately thereafter).</i>

 <br><br>

 This is of course a long-winded project, that will remain <font
color=blue>in fieri</font> for some time.<br><br>
HTML format, font sizes and colors have been chosen in order to be optimally seen ON LINE with a <a href="tuttiope.htm">Opera browser</a> 
with the option "full screen mode" (just press the taste <font color=blue>F11</font>). <br>
Use such option and each page with all relative notes will be perfectly visible on a single 17' screen. 

Just align the brown bar that precedes each page with the top of your screen.<br>
The white gaps between the pages have on-line aligning aims and also the purpose of allowing a neat separate printing on A4 standard sheets.<br><br>
I have used my own (massgebend) sources of the original texts. For scanning purposes 
I have used Omnipage Pro 12 Office.  After having scanned the texts I have
accurately checked
 everything more than once (however I would be grateful for any nit-picking). 
 I think I am fully qualified for this kind of work: After all I have a University Diplom in History of the early Middle ages <u>and</u> 
 a German University Doctorat 
 in Geschichte des früheren Mittelalters. Moreover  my mentor's <a target=_top href="http://www.searchlores.org/evaluate.htm#siela">Sielaff</a>'s
lessons have not been forgotten.<br><br>
