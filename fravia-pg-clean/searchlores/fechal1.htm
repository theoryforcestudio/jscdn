A possible solution, by ~Veliti~
<pre>
For Mp3s' there's many different ways of finding them.
You could just go to Napster, but I figure you want us to try it
out on the web, which makes it a bit harder.  
First thing wouldc be to figure out what search engine.  
Lets try good old Google. We could also use a specialized 
engines (à la Geocities), though.
   
Next is the search string. Just to start out, I have never heard
of the song nor of the group.  
          1)+"Aqua Barbie" +mp3   
recieved many pages + w/ barbie girl as the title so...

          2)+"Aqua Barbie" +mp3 -girl zip   
used -girl to get rid or the barbie "girl" part then remembered 
that alot of times on the web they place mp3 files in zip format!  

Bingo! From the many thousand (1) I narrowed it down to about 40 (2)

The first few look like the typical useless "list pages" so just keep 
looking...  looks like from the 7th site downwards could hold some signal.  
There it is right there (in zip format nevertheless)

 First Test: clues...Aqua Barbie, mp3
 Solution: Google.com
            +"Aqua Barbie" +mp3 -girl zip
<a href="http://members.nbci.com/abi98nkg/abi98.html">http://members.nbci.com/abi98nkg/abi98.html</a>

*** isn't that a Geocities-type web site farm? "NBCI" ;)</pre>
<i>No, it's a concoction of xoom and snap</i><prE>
*** of course, if your in a hurry, NAPSTER (for any mp3)

<br>1) [mp3] mp3 searching
<br>Elementary inference skills ('few elements' searching) &amp; crap-sites
 elimination basics
<p>Aqua Barbie, the hunt: in search of the blue doll
<p>I must admit that I have probably only downloaded about (3) three&nbsp;
mp3's in as many years
<p>It was probably just my bad searching techniques but I do recall at
the time it was very frustrating to locate the song that I wanted.
<p>It was even more frustrating to finaly find the dam song and to find
out that it was only a 30 second clip
<p>I have read at searchlores only yesterday, while hovering around the last section 
of +fravia's site, that nowadays the songsters feed you 
portions
 of a song and as you are listening to it it is <a href="fu_softi.htm#gathe">dumping the content</a>
so that you can not even save it... I read about what happened to this place called Napster too; I had never visited napster before...I guess
 you can put it down to my rarely being interested in searching for
and procuring mp3's...
<p>Wanting to avoid finding 30 second clips and downloads that you can
not even save anymore I asked myself WHERE can I probably find a FULL version of this barbie song that I can also download?
<br>The answer that came to me was the classical 'combing' strategie: 
to find someone else who had already found it and saved it
<p>So I went to google and requested her to find me
<br>index +of/ Aqua Barbie mp3
<p>I get myself 248 hits
<p>(note that I typed in ( index +of / ) ... google will get me returns
in this way of peoples exposed/ Open directories... If you think about
it, and it's possibilities, I'm sure you can come up with a major list
of snooping-keyword-exploits :)
<p>but back to the blue doll
<br>the third link is what I am looking for it seems to me...
<br>Index of /vascoant/mp3
<p>Index of /vascoant/mp3. ... 20:42 3.7M All_Saints__Pure_Sho..>
<br>08-Sep-2000 21:30 6.0M
<br>&lt;b>Aqua - Barbie Girl.mp3 &lt;/b>28-Mar-2000 17:11 3.0M Aqua - Doctor
Jones
<br>...
<br>digilander.iol.it/vascoant/mp3/ - 2k - Cached - Similar pages
<p>now i can just step into vascoant's mp3 directory and have a look
<br>around, where i see:
<br>Aqua - Barbie Girl.mp3&nbsp; 28-Mar-2000 17:11&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.0M a 3 meg download... I assume that this is not a 30 second clip then
<p>The word Girl though is throwing me off... (IF I KNEW the name of the 
band and the name of the song I was looking for this would not have
been a problem in this search...but I better make sure)
<p>I look at the fourth link and go to
<br>it...<A href="http://home-1.worldonline.nl/~ac57216/mp3/lyrics/" target="_blank">http://home-1.worldonline.nl/~ac57216/mp3/lyrics/</A>
 and it also says... Aqua-Barbie Girl&nbsp; ... and it has other songs
next to the Aqua name so now I presume that Aqua is probably the name of the group and that 
Barbie (GIRL) is the full name of the song
<p>(assume and presume are not real great things to have in my vocabulary 
but one day as knowledge and practice take over I will <i>presumably</i>
 be able to throw those keywords out of my writtings&nbsp; :)
<p>Time to find:...1-2-3 minutes

<font color=blue>[</font>An example of possible solution</a>
<font color=blue>]</font><br> 
~Veliti~'s approach, slightly edited by fravia+
<br><br>I know the first two tests are quite easy; so I hesitated 
to write this but I figured out that if I write something then 
maybe others would write too.  The second Quest's Clue:<br> 
"Ingenium quondam fuerat pretiosius nuro
 At nunc barbaria est grandis haber nihil"<br>
Well the first engine to use when searching for text should be
 Raging, shouldn't it? <bR>So off to raging I went.<br>
Now, when searching for a quote: should we use the 
entire quote or just fragments of it?  Well for this 
search we can start with just fragments. <br> 
First Fragment: +"Ingenium quondam" Gives me 1 page :) <br>
It's a "fisherman" page at www.grenadines.net/carriacou/johnsmithhomepage.htm :( <br> 
Well before we give up, lets try a different variation!
Second Fragment: +"fuerat pretiosius" Gives me 2 pages :)<br> 
The first one seems to be that same "fisherman" page. <br>
I wonder why?? THIS IS A LAB so we should figure out why it keeps appearing. 
It doesn't seem to have anything to do with what we are looking for 
(of course I checked the source code).<br>
Probably just the "messed up" way engines do sort things.  But why does this happen?<br>
Is it possible that these words have been previously on those pages and now disappeared?<br>It 
seems highly unlikely given the content of the page, but let's see: 
if so these words might have been there when Google, <u>with its glorious cache</u>, catalogued them.
Let's see:<br><font size=-1>
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=30&meta=hl%3D%26lr%3D&q=%2B%22Ingenium+quondam%22">http://www.google.com/search?num=30&meta=hl%3D%26lr%3D&q=%2B%22Ingenium+quondam%22</a>
</fonT><bR>Woha! I was wrong! Google is definitely MUCH better than raging for this specific 
snippet example!<br>
<br>Ok, next time I'll start by Google when searching snippets. (After all for <font color=blue>+"Ingenium 
quondam"</fonT> Altavista & Raging give only 1 result, 
Hotbot and Fast give 6 results each, but google gives 12 different results!).
<bR>Anyway let's keep on track! I was investigating Google's cache to see if we can find 
an older copy of this strange Fisherman page:<br><font size=-1>
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:www.grenadines.net/carriacou/johnsmithhomepage.htm+Grenadines.net+Whale+Sighting+Network">http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:www.grenadines.net/carriacou/johnsmithhomepage.htm</a>
</fonT><bR>Nope, it must be a raging quirck then. Or maybe google re-indexed its cache recently, 
after those world were taken off the source code... unlikely... Is there any other 
reason for Raging indexing that page that doesn't have a single latin word in it?<br><br>

I wonder how anyone would possibly ever find that nice man "fisherman" page.<br>
(unless they were specifically looking for it!)
<br><br>
Anyways where were we?  The second page in Raging seems to carry very strong signal.

<DIV>Dear Fravia,</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>after&nbsp;finally getting to the classrooms/lab1 on your a(maze)ing site, i feel the solution to the second task: referenced text searching, presented there is not complete.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>It seems to me not only important to find the referenced text, but also&nbsp;the translation thereof. I admight it is a shortcoming not to know latin, i think i'm not the only one though. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Below are the notes i wrote will trying to find the text and the translation. Please excuse the unshaven format, and do with this text as you see fit.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Sincerely,</DIV>

<DIV>ok enough, lets try and find the full name of this book by Ovidius then:</DIV>
<DIV>google: +Ovidius +amor +(book OR text) : 500+ results<BR>+Ovidius +amor +(books OR texts) : ~300 resuls<BR>most results here are about (meth(amor)phosis), this is not what we're looking for.</DIV>
<DIV><BR>i didn't mention it earlier, it becomes important now though:<BR>in the directory Ovide/ ( see above) there are also text files with names like: met&lt;number&gt;.txt i have taken these files to be the methamorphosis texts, therefore the amor(es) texts are not from the methamorphosis (fair enough?)</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>ok, not getting anywhere, lets try:<BR>+Ovidius +amores +(books OR texts)<BR>right: even more (391) results, however from the results it is clear that the title of the book is amores,<BR>on the first result page, lets try: <A href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/ovid/lboo/" target="_blank">http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/ovid/lboo/</A></DIV>

<font color=red>3)</font> [Text] Easy introduction to "plagiarism" seeking<br>"The secret of the many words" searching<br><br>
"<font color=blue>The professional industry standard remains Adobe Photoshop (version 5 is now available), 
a full-featured image editing application. However, if you work on a PC, you may want to 
try Paint Shop Pro, which has some of the same features for a fraction of the cost</font>"<br>
</font>
    <br>
Possible solution for the 3rd "challenge" of the first classroom 

<br><br>
After I tried the first 2 tests of this lab, i realized those were 
for real newbies [I'm not that expert myself, I'm a newbie too]. 
It took me only one second to find relevant results (using google). <br>
In the third one It me took a little more than that. I thought I should write 
this because there were no solutions published.<br>
First what does the word <b><i>plagiarism</i></b> mean?<font size=-3 color="#015000">
(As you may have realized, english is not my first language, it's neither the 
2nd)</font> <br>
I looked it up in the dictionary, for those who are lazy and who doesn't 
know, <i> it's the act of plagiarizing, which means to steal and
 pass off (the ideas or words of another) as one's own.</i> I have no 
clue what does it have to do with searching (not yet at least) perhabs we'll 
learn during the solving of this essay... <br>
<br>
Back to the test:<br>
I assumed that I am searching for a page containing the text: <br>
<font color=blue><i>"The professional industry standard remains Adobe
 Photoshop (version 5 is now available), a full-featured image editing application. 
However, if you work on a PC, you may want to try Paint Shop Pro, which has some of 
the same features for a fraction of the cost"</i></font><br>
I doesn't make sense to copy the whole text to the search engine of your choice 
(google was my first choice- and lazyness plays a big role in that, because as you
 may know the opera browser (ver:6) uses(by default) google as the 1st choice when 
we search using it) so I had to choose a part of the text to copy.[BTW most search 
engines support a limited number of search words, google supports 10 , correct me 
if I'm wrong.]<br>
I chose the first time "professional industry standard remains Adobe Photoshop 
(version 5 is now available)" that's a lot, but who cares I'm just copy/pasting.
 Too bad no result (except fravia pages and mirrors which are scattered all over
 the net [that's real good having your pages all over the net])
So I removed some part of this long query, I tried [ "Adobe Photoshop 
(version 5 is now available)" -fravia ]  but still no luck. Well google
 didnt do it perhabs others can.<br>
I tried alltheweb.com, altavista... still nothing. If you're getting 
the wrong answers chances are that you are asking the wrong questions.
 Change the query.<br>
Now I used (back to google) [ "Adobe Photoshop" +"Paint Shop Pro" ] 
 and I got sooooo many results, much more than I need (that's logical
 these two softwares are really old and you rarely mention one without
 the other). But still that's a good start, much better than before. 
(BTW when using opera search features you can get the results from both 
google and alltheweb each in a different browser window by selecting
 "super search" from the search engines dropdown list.)<br>
So now I must narrow my search results. I added to the previous query 
"professional industry standard". I got three results.<br>
The search querry was: <br>[ "Adobe Photoshop" + " Paint Shop Pro" +"
 professional industry standard" -fravia ]<br>
The second result seems to be the good one.
 <a href="http://tony.radio-esperanto.com/web_docs/wdesign/ch19_05.htm" target="_blank">Tools Overview (Web Design in a Nutshell, 2nd Edition) 
 "http://tony.radio-esperanto.com/web_docs/wdesign/ch19_05.htm"</a> 
I opened it and I found the following text:<br>
"<i><b>The professional industry standard remains 
Adobe Photoshop (Version <font color = "#9f0000" >6</font> 
is available<font color = "#9f0000" > as of this writing</font>),
 a full-featured image<font color = "#9f0000" >-</font>editing application 
<font color = "#9f0000" >(see http://www.adobe.com for more information)</font>. 
However, if you work on a PC, you may want to try Paint Shop Pro, which has some 
of the same features <font color = "#9f0000" >at a lower </font>cost.</b></i>"
 <br>
I tried to colorize the differences between what I was 
supposed to find
 and what I found. It seems I found an updated version
 of the text.[it seems that Adobe Photoshop was still in Version 5] 
That was the best I could do. If anyone can do better 
and find the exact text, or maybe find a copy of the 
older text still unupdated, that would be good. 
I hope you can describe How you did it.
<hr>
Now what did I learn from this essay?<br>
First : try different search engines.(I did't learn it now 
I already know it, I've read too many fravia's;)<br>
Second: try different querries, if too many words give no result, 
shorten your querry and than narrow it bit by bit.<br>
Third : it's a good idea to understand what are you searching for 
and analyse the results, why are they many and/or why are they 
little and/or what are the most frequent results. This will 
help filtering the noise and focus on the relevant results.

I'm not suffering from insanity, I'm enjoying every minute of it. 
(That's not mine. That's plagiarism:P [greetings to the 
author who ever he is])

<br>- decoration, medal, badge, pin
<br>- 300
<br>
<br>Usually I start a search with alltheweb.
<br>
<br>First search:
<br>Keywords: russian+navy+decoration
<br>http://www.bos2.alltheweb.com/cgi-bin/advsearch?terms=3&type=any&query=russian+navy+decoration&exec=FAST+Search&lang=any
<br>7400687 documents found - 0.336 seconds search time
<br>Too many.
<br>
<br>Second search
<br>Keywords: russian+navy+decoration must contain 300 in the text
<br>http://www.bos2.alltheweb.com/cgi-bin/advsearch?terms=3&type=any&query=russian+navy+decoration&exec=FAST+Search&lang=any&enco=iso-8859-1&A1=%2B&B1=300&C1=&A2=%2B&B2=&C2=&A3=-&B3=&C3=&dincl=&dexcl=&hits=10&nooc=on
<br>541632 documents found - 0.41 seconds search time
<br>Still too many.
<br>
<br>Another approach is in order. On the WWW most websites are in English.
<br>To reduce the hits, lets try a new search in another language. In this case: French.
<br>
<br>Third search
<br>Keywords: décorations+russes
<br>http://www.bos2.alltheweb.com/cgi-bin/advsearch?terms=3&type=phrase&query=d%E9corations+russes&exec=FAST+Search&lang=any
<br>4 documents found - 0.022 seconds search time
<br>Good&#33;
<br>The "Bibliographie sur la phaleristique russe" seems promising.
<br>It has a link page to russie/embleme/html/stg/liens.htm It's well organised, with a subdivision to Soviet Russia from 1917-1991. Lets see there:
<br>
<br>1- The Soviet Military Awards Page
<br>members.xoom.com/abates/
<br>2- Réunions des musées russes
<br>www.museum.ru
<br>3- Collectrussia
<br>www.collectrussia.com
<br>4- Soviet Orders & Medals Links
<br>members.aol.com/sovietuk/links.htm
<br>5- Historicalresearch
<br>www.historicalresearch.com/
<br>6- Orders and Medals of the USSR
<br>http://www.acadiacom.net/adimag/
<br>
<br>Link 1,2 did not give good quick results.
<br>Link 4 points to another links list. The Soviet Militaria Site catch my attention because there is a Navy and Marines Badges page (/badges.html#NAVY) with a slightly different picture of the badge.
<br>Bingo?

<br>
<br>Link 3, a commercial one, was followed after discovering the value of "300". There is a pic identical to 183-2-01.jpg but with a different background and another name.

<br>===========================
<br>
<br>1.How easy (or difficult) was it to figure out the correct approach? 
<br>Surprisingly easy. I have tried 2/3 times some time ago using the file name(183-2-01.jpg) approach without any results.
<br>
<br>2.Was the formulation adequate to help you plan your search?
<br>No.
<br>
<br>3.Which search-approaches and strategies did you choose?
<br>First take the clues from the image itself. Second, use keywords in a language other than English.
<br>
<br>4.Did you use any "classical" search engine? If so which ones?
<br>Alltheweb
<br>
<br>5.Did you use any "special" search engine? If so which ones?
<br>-
<br>
<br>6.How many results did you retrieve? 
<br>First 7.400.687 then 4.
<br>
<br>7.What proportion of the results were relevant to your perceived information requirements?
<br>One.
<br> 
<br>8.How current were the results? How many 404s? 
<br>The first good pointer was recently updated. No 404.
<br>
<br>9.Was the amount of detail displayed with the results enough to allow you tho evaluate? 
<br>Yes, because the search was related to a narrow field: russian naval decoration.
<br>
<br>10.Was the order in which the results were displayed evident or apparently illogical? 
<br>Logical.
<br>
<br>11.What other features contribute to (or detract from) the utility of the tools and approaches you choosed? 
<br>I had a low level of concentration, as the kids were playing hide and seek all over the place. The last pic was found while 2 kids hiding right at my feet.
<br>
<br>12.Did you time your query? 
<br>Total search time: 01:00:40
<br>
<br>Summary
<br>The specific 183-2-01.jpg was not found. The search was cancelled when 2 
similar badges were found, and after I discover the why and when there it was 
minted.<br>(ie)faf<br>

...continued from my <a href="http://www.2113.ch/phplab/mbs.php3/mb001?view=extend&num=982701410&thread=981302846" target=_blank>postings</a> at The Seekers messageboard
(note: i didn't post this afterall ---I'm not sure if its a secret thing
--- or if its suppossed to be OPEN to a person or group effort so I 
won't post till I find out)<br>
so as you can see my search began looking for other pins that might 
have some of the same symbols on them---instead of trying to find the exact
pin from Lab1--- had i stumbled on it all the better (but I wouldn't
have learned much)--- after I realizeed my mistake in thinking these
were WINGS under the single STAR and finding a match of this particular
symbol at: <a href="http://www.icbm.com/ss-508.jpg" 
target=_blank>a similar pin </a> 
<br>
it wasn't but a few more moments looking at this sites additional links
that I saw the Blue X on white background Flag
<a href="http://www.icbm.com/sovsub1.htm" target=_blank>found the flag </a> 
<br>
so ok...I have probably identified the flag (but not its meaning), the
Country (Russia), and which unit of military (Submarine) that this (pin) 
probably belongs too by looking at other similar pins...
<br>
lab1 additional
having now gathered some more keywords
google
I search for:

me...
<br><br>
now this one looks familiar eh? I see nothing on PINS but I see a link
to 'badges'--- I was wonderin' why that 'badges' reference was there
from ~M Scuba diving post...I figured I'd keep my eye pealed for that
word in case it was an additional humph clue...I am wondering now 
though
<br><br>
weather I would have clicked on this link if i had not been focused in
on trying to unravel that scuba diving message...if it had the word PIN
in it I would have for sure...but now I am interested in what IS a
soviet badge?...

hummmm... no search engine here ---but these certainly look like
'pins'!!! ---so a badge is similar to a pin---might have to look up 
what
<br>
the difference is between the two--- but I can add 'badges' to my list
of keywords now for sure!~

so there are many images here and I am gona have to look thru many

          This Russian official submarine badge made out of brass and
enamel, approx. size 1.5"<br><br>

This seems to be the one...

Time to find image with the above search keywords...aprox 5 minutes

total time to gather words -ideas- other false ideas---searching
flags/pins/ ect... probably 3-4 hours plus 5 minutes :)<center>

additional: it seems to me now, that the flag was not a COUNTRY flag;
which was why I could not find it because I did not expand my thinking

Military flag??? well--I'll have to look it up and see...

Example 1
<br>by Loki, January 2001,<br>
<br>www.gametime.com is unrelated.
<br>
<br>Our program seems to have been written in DOS ( ascii art ).
<br>The gametime name could refer to some coding group.
<br>
<br>Search for gametime+DOS gives nothing ( some BBS respond, but too long to answer )
<br>
<br>Why not using ftpsearch to find the whole package ? 
<br>How could it have been named ? Wich packager ? 
<br>pfinder.arj ? pfinder.rar ?
<br>pathfinder.zip ?
<br>pathfind.zip ?
<br>
<br>trying the following one
<font size=-1> 
<br><a href="http://ftpsearch.lycos.com/cgi-bin/search?form=lycosnet&type=Case+insensitive+multiple+substrings+search&filetype=All+files&query=pathfind.zip&hits=10">http://ftpsearch.lycos.com/cgi-bin/search?form=lycosnet&type=Case+insensitive+multiple+substrings+search&filetype=All+files&query=pathfind.zip&hits=10</a>
</fonT>
<br>Downloading the first one
<br>Reading pathfind.doc 
<br>
<br>--------------------------------
<br>* * PATHFIND version 1.0 * *
<br>
<br>PATHFIND looks at the PATH in DOS and returns all files with the
<br>filename that you specify.
<br>Usage:  PATHFIND filename.ext
<br>----------------------------------
<br>
<br>not the same ascii art ... is it another path-finder ? It's not the same name too
<br>
<br>but :
<br>
<br>-----------------------------
<br>We at Gametime, have also written other programs:
<br>Which include some fantastic CGA games, Educational software,
<br>as well as some quite valuable utilities&#33;

<br>-----------------------------
<br>
<br>it is the same coder &#33;
<br>
<br>
<br>Ok, so the given ascii in the lab is the header when u run the program :)
<br>PATH-FINDer version 1.0 &lt;= PATH-FIND is in caps
<br>
<br>we're done :)

<a name="exa2"></a>
Example 2
<br>by Loki, January 2001,<br>
My first approach was a brutal raging search. Maybe during 5 minutes. 
<br>But the fact that the group was named Gametime create lots of noise to use this kind of approach : lots of game docs, lots of tools for rpg.
<br>
<br>This was the (M) Mechanical mode ( using the information given on the seachal page ), queries like "Gametime Products present's" or "PATH-FINDer version 1.0"
<br>I think that mode has the particularity to be easily coded.
<br>
<br>The next approach uses more of our brain, the (I) Intelligence Mode.
<br>Let's think a little, what we have is an ascii art ( -&gt; DOS ? ), of a tool written by Lawrence Daniels ( a programmer ) in the Gametime group/company/sect.
<br>Why not trying to find a coding team called Gametime, maybe an oldsk00l group :)
<br>The search for gametime+dos gives some noise. Maybe the BBS related answer are interesting.
<br>5 minutes later ... maybe it is possible to find that portion of text ( seems to be a header ==&gt; "No wild cards ('*','?') or backslash ('\') in file" ) using the (I) mode, but the digging could be long
<br>
<br>That let me introduce the (U) Mode ... it's a "de-mode". A little similar to the (I) one, but maybe, more organic ? Call it zen if u want :)
<br>We need a proggy, maybe written some years ago ( few ones write dos programs in our days ). It must be on some server .. ftp one &#33; 
<br>Okay, why not FTPSearch.
<br>
<br>But for what ? :) Read the <a href="http://www.searchlores.org/nomomen.htm">nomomen lessons</a>
<br>
<br>DOS tool, must have a readme file no ? so it must be packaged. Zip, rar, arj ?
<br>The most common : zip. Anyway, we can make searches without firstly.
<br>It must be a 8 letters max file. 
<br>pfinder / pafind / pathfind ?
<br>pathfind looks the most ... real :) And it is in caps (PATH-FINDer)
<br>
<br>I tried pathfind in first, and it was the good one.
<br>pathfind.zip to clean the list
<br>http://ftpsearch.lycos.com/cgi-bin/search?form=lycosnet&type=Case+insensitive+multiple+substrings+search&filetype=All+files&query=pathfind.zip&hits=10 
<br>
<br>
<br>Total time : ~15 minutes
<br>
<br>
<br>The M, I, and U mode were taken from the GEB ( "Goedel Escher Bach an Eternal Golden Braid" ) of D. Hoffstader.
<br>He used them to represents 3 different approach of an enigm in a formal system.
<br>What suprised me is that the U mode IS written to be the zen approach :)
