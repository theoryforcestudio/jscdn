Well, I didn't know *<u>anything</u>* was already in the public domain! </i>

<br><br>
</center></center></center></center>

Please excuse my English, and please excuse my excessive lack of political correctness. That -and my disdain for 
all commercial aspects- is probably 
also one of the reasons I'm the only one 
here, together with my good old <a href="photos.htm#dange">friend</a>: The <a target=_top href="http://www.hack.lu/index.php/List#The_grugq">Grugq</a>, 
who prefers to use a 
pseudonym&nbsp;:-)<br>
<br>Thank-you for inviting me. I kinda like Luxembourg: klein aber fein. 
<br>
I also like reversers, and crackers and hackers. Always did. Sons of the light: deserve some cosmic searching power.
<bR>
<br>
We'll examine some 'alternative'  
       searching techniques: On today's menu: music and books � la carte.<br>As a proof of concept we will search  
        some <a href="Luxembourg_2006.htm#analiz">mp3s</a> and some 
       <a href="Luxembourg_2006.htm#quarry">books</a> (today about the python programming language). 
       <br> 
       <br>Searching such simple targets (music and books) 
       we will, maybe, demonstrate 
      <ol type=a><li> that everything is on the web; 
      </li><li> that you can  search rather effectively <u>without</u> using google; 
      </li><li> that  some "alternative searching paths" can be quite useful for seekers.</li></ol>
   
       Of course our searches are not limited to just music and books. 
       <br>Seekers can always find anything: whatever. Any image, any journal, any film, any software you fancy is somewhere
       on the nethervoid at your disposal. <bR>
       In fact <font color=blue>anything that may have been digitized</font> <u><b>is indeed</b></u> 
       somewhere out there (one of the 'optimistic' laws of searching). <bR><br>
       
       <center><table border=1 width=86% cellpadding=4><tr><td>
       Even more important is the fact 
       that not only  "tangible" and "digitized" targets are available to anyone, 
       but also  all kind of 
        <u><font color=blue>solutions</font></u> are there, at your disposal. And I don't mean just messageboard solutions 
        on -say- how to port a proprietary driver to GNU/Linux.<bR>
        I mean real <u>concrete</u> solutions:  
   <ul><li>
        You want to counter a specific politician?<bR>  
        Find out and document all his nasty deeds during the last 10 years. A little <a href="stalking.htm">stalking</a> and 
      a moderate amount of searching skills are probably all you need to send him in Jail.</li><li> You want to 
        counter and diminish those annoying ubiquitous advertisement panels?<bR>
             Someone, somewhere has posted experiences, <a href="realicra/as_billi.htm">best practices</a> and ideas.</li><li>

      <br>A propos mp3 and books: <font color="#400080">a small caveat: Somebody  told me     long ago
      -politely- that we should not download  songs or books that  are patented, or have not  yet 
       been released in the public domain. OK. I can understand that,  as strange as it sounds</font> (because, silly me,
        I  always understood copyright as 
       the right to copy).
        <bR>Anyway we will just have an innocent look at our targets <u>on line</u>. 
        If your local political clowns forbid it, <u>don't download forbidden fruits</u>, please, (or if you do it,       
        you should practice some basic <a href="noanon.htm">anonymity</a> precautions...<br>

<br><br>
 Your browser (should be <a href="tuttiope.htm">Opera</a> btw) is of tantamount importance for searching purposes, 
and can do wonders, if correctly trimmed...<br>

And now let's begin... 
<br>
<br>
<br>         
   <a name="recallprecision"></a>

<center><i>Almost everything but also a lot of junk... <td>&nbsp;</tD><td><center> <i>...or just a few mostly relevant results?</i></td></tr></table>
<br><br> </center>



The real problem -when searching- is not even anonymity and it is not even speed: it is the 
<font color=blue>relevance</font>, 
<font color=blue>coherence</font> and 
<font color=blue>reliability</font> 
of our searching results.<br><bR>In order to obtain such relevance, coherence and reliability you need  some sound
<a href="evaluate.htm">evaluation</a> techniques, but  a more methodological approach to searching can help as well.<bR>
Two important concepts you must be aware of, when searching, are those of <font color="#0000ff">RECALL</font> and 
<font color="#0000ff">PRECISION</font> ("precision" is the accepted terminology, but "relevance" would probably be 
a better term).
<bR><bR>
 <font color="#0000ff">Recall</font> is the ratio (%) of 
		   the number of relevant records retrieved to the total number of <b><u>relevant</u></b> records that might exist 
		   (hard to calculate how many might really exist, of course, but 
		   we are just using indicative parameters).<bR> Hence recall is <u>relevant retrieved documents</u> / relevant documents.<bR>
		  <br>
<font color="#0000ff">Precision</font> (or "Relevance") is the ratio (%) of the number of relevant 
		records retrieved to the total  
		number of <b><u>all</u></b> (irrelevant and relevant) records retrieved (this might be calculated, anyway note that
		in reality there is not such a clean "objective" distinction between relevant and irrelevant, a lot depends on your taste). 
		<bR>Hence Precision is <u> retrieved documents</u> / relevant documents.<br>
		   <br>
		   Here two graphic attempts to explain this: in the  void of the <font color="#0000ff">irrelevant blue</font> results,  
		   there are some  <font color="#ff0000">relevant red</font> results.<br>
		   Different kind of queries, here imagined as a transparent layer, (but you can see some real life examples -for mp3 
		   searching- <a href="Luxembourg_2006.htm#analiz">below</a>)  
		   will give <u>either</u> recall <u>or</u> precision. <br><bR>
		       <center>
         <table border=0>
         	<tR>
         	<td><center><u>Broad</u> (<font color="#0000ff">Recall</font>) Query</td>
         	<td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
        <td><center><u>Narrow</u> (<font color="#0000ff">Precision</font>)  Query</td></tr>
         	<tR>
         	<td><IMG src="images/precision7.jpg" height=300 width=300></td>
         	<td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
        <td><IMG src="images/precision6.jpg" height=300 width=300></td></tr></table> </center>

   <br>Add synonyms to your query (or use our <a href="synecdoc.htm">synecdochical searching method</a>) and your precision will suffer (but 
   your recall will increase). Use a proximity operator (like the NEAR operator in altavista) and your precision  (may/will) increase (but also, 
   of course, your 
   recall will/might suffer).       <br>
   There are differences between the <a href="main.htm">main</a> search engines as well: for instance google has a (slightly) higher precision than
    yahoo, yahoo has a (slightly) higher recall than google. <br>
   <bR> 
    
    
    <br><table border="0" width=88%><tR><td><font size=+1>
    	Also  always consider that the  <a href="main.htm">main</a> search engines DO NOT overlap too much and yet 
    that they cover together (at best) only 1/4 of the web, 
    this may be quite significant when deciding your search strategies.<br> 
Many clueless zombies consider "searching the web" tantamount to digit one term inside google and then clicking enter.

Such a simplistic approach is wrong, and not only for the "one-termness" of it.
The real problem is that google <font color=blue>covers only a small part</fonT> of the web. 
<bR> 
In order to access a bigger part of it you will need to use techniques that go from <a href="stalking.htm">stalking</a> to <a href="luring.htm">social 
engineering</a>, 
through <a href="trolls.htm">trolling</a> and <a href="password.htm">passwords breaking</a>.</td><td> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</tD><td align=right><center>
<IMG SRC="images/searchenginescoverage.jpg" ALT="coverage" WIDTH="283" HEIGHT="283" ></tD></tR></table>  
     <br><br>
   <bR>Back to Recall and Precision: 
   as a seeker, you must decide beforehand the aim of your search:
   do you want to find everything on a given topic, or do you want just the most relevant texts? 
   Or do you instead want <u>almost</u> everything? Or just <u>some</u> 
   texts?<bR> 
   This will determine what searching <a href="longtermsearching.htm">strategies</a> you'll have to use. 
   Many search techniques 
     may be used to gain either more recall or more precision (in fact there are even techniques that will 
     allow you to increase BOTH, despite the fact that recall and precision are -usually- inversely related).  
     <br><br>
     This said, as the two graphics above point out, there's absolutely no way you can cover ALL relevant results, due to the fact that even 
     using the best searching techniques (remember that 
    the <a href="main.htm">main</a> search engines  cover just about a  
     third of the indexed web) you will never be able to cover the whole web. <bR><br>
     Our aim as seekers is to have BOTH precision and recall. We want (ideally) to retrieve everything that is relevant, 
     and everything that has been retrieved should (ideally) be relevant. We'll now use some tricks  to (try to) do this.

        <bR> <font color="#0000ff">MSN Live's  operators:</font> <br>
        	                <font color="#0000ff">contains:</font>
Restricts results to sites that have links to the file type(s) you specify. 
For example, to search for websites that contain links to mp3 files, type music contains:mp3.
 
<font color="#0000ff"> filetype:</font> 
Returns only web pages created in the file format you specify. 
Live Search recognizes html, txt, and pdf extensions. 
Live Search also recognizes the extensions for primary 
Office document types. For example, to find reports created in PDF format, 
type your subject, followed by filetype:pdf. For example, 
type information filetype:pdf.
 
 <font color="#0000ff">inanchor:, inbody:, intitle:, inurl: </font>
Returns pages that contain the specified term in the anchor, 
body, title, or web address of the site, respectively. 
Specify only one term per keyword. You can string multiple keyword entries as needed. 
For example, to find pages that contain google in the anchor, and 
the terms black and blue in the body, type inanchor:google inbody:black inbody:blue.
 
 <font color="#0000ff">ip: </font> 
Finds sites that are hosted by a specific IP address. 
The IP address must be a dotted quad address. 
Type the IP: keyword, followed by the IP address of the website. For example, type IP:80.83.47.151.
 
<font color="#0000ff"> language: </font> 
Returns web pages for a specific language. Specify the language code directly after the language: keyword. 

 
 <font color="#0000ff">link:</font>  
Finds sites that have links to the specified website or domain. 
This is useful for determining who links to whom. Do not add a space between link: 
and the web address. For example, to find pages that contain the word games 
and that link to searchlores.org, type <a target=_top href="http://search.live.com/results.aspx?q=games+link%3Asearchlores.org&mkt=en-IE&form=QBRE&go.x=0&go.y=0">games link:searchlores.org</a> &nbsp; 
 
 <font color="#0000ff">linkdomain: </font> 
Finds sites that link to any page within the specified domain. 
Use this keyword to determine how many links are being made to a 
specific page, as well as how those links are made. For example, 
to see pages that link to searchlores, type linkdomain:searchlores.org.  
 <font color="#0000ff">linkfromdomain:</font>  
Finds sites that are linked from the specified domain. Use this keyword to determine how many 
links are being made from a specific page, as well as how those links are made. 
For example, to see pages that are linked from my site, type <a target=_top href="http://search.live.com/results.aspx?q=linkfromdomain%3Afravia.net&mkt=en-IE&form=QBRE&go.x=0&go.y=0">linkfromdomain:fravia.net</a> &nbsp;   
 <font color="#0000ff">loc:, location:</font> 
Returns web pages from a specific country or region. Specify the country or region code directly after the 
loc: keyword. To focus on two or more languages, use a logical OR 
and group the languages. For example, <a target=_top href="http://search.live.com/results.aspx?q=%22core+python%22+%28loc%3ARU+OR+loc%3ACN%29&mkt=en-IE&form=QBRE&go.x=0&go.y=0">"core python" (loc:RU OR loc:CN)</a> &nbsp; 
 
 <font color="#0000ff">prefer: </font> 
Adds emphasis on either a word or another operator. For example, type <a target=_top href="http://search.live.com/results.aspx?FORM=QBRE3&q=searching+prefer%3Ainternet&go.x=0&go.y=0">searching prefer:internet</a> &nbsp;
 
 <font color="#0000ff">site:</font>  

Returns web pages that belong to the specified site. To focus on two or more domains, 
use a logical OR and group the domains. Do not add a space after the colon (:). 
You can use site search for web domains, top level domains, 
and directories that are not more than two levels deep. For example, 
to see web pages about media reporting from the BBC or CNN websites, 
type "media reporting" (site:bbc.co.uk OR site:cnn.com).

You can also search for web pages that contain a specific search word on a site. 
For example, to find the library pages  
on searchlores, type <a target=_top href="http://search.live.com/results.aspx?q=site%3Awww.searchlores.org%2Flibrary&mkt=en-IE&form=QBRE&go.x=0&go.y=0">site:www.searchlores.org/library</a> 

 
 <font color="#0000ff">feed:</font>  
Finds RSS or Atom feeds on a website. For example, to find RSS or Atom feeds about web searching, 
type <a target=_top href="http://search.live.com/results.aspx?q=feed%3A%22web+searching%22&mkt=en-IE&form=QBRE&go.x=0&go.y=0">feed:"web searching"</a> &nbsp; 
 
 <font color="#0000ff">hasfeed:</font>  
Finds web pages that contain an RSS or Atom feed on a website. You can add search words to 
narrow your search. For example, to find web pages 
on the Guardian website that contain RSS or Atom feeds about google, type <a target=_top href="http://search.live.com/results.aspx?q=site%3Awww.guardian.co.uk+hasfeed%3Agoogle&mkt=en-IE&form=QBRE&go.x=0&go.y=0">site:www.guardian.co.uk hasfeed:google</a> &nbsp;
 
 <font color="#0000ff">url: </font> 
Checks whether the listed domain or web address is in the Live Search index. 
Do not add a space between url: and the domain or web address. For example, 
to verify that searchlores is in the index, type <a target=_top href="http://search.live.com/results.aspx?q=url%3Asearchlores.org&mkt=en-IE&form=QBRE&go.x=0&go.y=0">url:searchlores.org</a> &nbsp;

	<li>
The <font color=blue>"group"</font> (or singer name) is mandatory. 
</li><li>Simply specifying a <font color="#0000ff">"title"</font> adds precision and 
loses recall (precision and recall are -most of the time- inversely proportional). 

(This means that if you add your target's <font color=blue>title</font> you diminish excessive noise but may miss some target sites).
</li><li>
The <font color=blue>"format variants"</font> will guarantee a broader spectrum. If the search engine you are using is heavily censored (as 
it happens more and more often) just <u>eliminate the <font color=blue>mp3</font> parameter</u>. Chances are that 
some (yet) 
uncensored
ma4 or some ogg file will be present inside our "real target" (mp3 censored music lists), and that these "ogg oddballs" will allow their retrieval.
When they will censor ma4s we'll invent something else&nbsp;:-)
</li><li>
The <font color=blue>intitle:"index of"</font> (or <font color="#000080">intitle:index.of</font>, which is the same but avoids 
two key-presses) is mandatory, and -spammers notwithstanding-
still allow fairly decent results. Of course the <font color=blue>intitle:</font> operator is to be used with 
google and yahoo, 
check the different operators for the other search engines, or just use a more simple (and spammed) 
<font color=blue>"index of"</font> string snippet.
</li><li>
The <font color=blue>-metallica</font> (or -beatles, or whatnots) serves as a <font color=blue>spamkiller</font>, because many clowns still try 
to fish zombies out of the knowledge web uploading huge lists of groups' names. If you'r going for high recall, then re-launch 
the same query with a different 
 singer acting as spamkiller.
</li><li>
Finally we come to the <u><font color=blue>LENGTH</font></u> parameter, which not only guarantees the 
presence of at least some Megabyte heavy mp3, thus cutting away all the irrelevant noise of those 
bogus "index of" spammer sites with "small snippets" of music, but also can be
varied  <i>ad libitum</i> and will thus guarantee you hours of fishing pleasure. You may try for instance all variations
in the range <font color=blue>1.6M - 6.4M</font>. I suggest starting in the range 3.5-4.5 (which is a good signal ratio for mp3s) and 
moving upward if you are an optimist and downward if you are a pessimist.

Note the useful spamkiller <font color="#0000ff">-download </font> and the fact that we search only for 
<font color="#0000ff">(mp3 OR wma OR m4a)</font>. You may add <font color="#0000ff">ogg</font> files as well. In fact there's no point 
in searching those infamous Ipod's  <font color="#0000ff">m4p</font>. However, 
should you happen to download some of those <font color="#0000ff">Ipod</font>'s "fairplay infected" AAC files, you may use 
a program like <a target=_top href="http://hymn-project.org/">JHymn</a> to play them wherever and whenever despite their ridiculous patents, 
and/or  converting them on the fly to a more useful (and unprotected) m4a format.

     <bR>
     Here a very simple, extremely short and yet quite useful query. You can launch this (or a very similar one) 
     with any good search engine... even 
     with google...<br><a target=_top href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&hl=en&lr=&q=shakira+%224.6m+%2A+snd%22&btnG=Search">shakira 
     	"4.6m * snd"</a><br>"Grown up" humans will probably substitute 
     "<font color="#0000ff">shakira</font>" with -say- "<a target=_top href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&hl=en&lr=&q=bach+%224.6m+%2A+snd%22&btnG=Search">bach</a>"&nbsp;:-)
     <br>
     Note -again- the added "variable" parameter +"4.6m". 
which is quite important in order to reduce noise and spam (again: you can  modulate as much as you fancy: 4.5, 4.6, 6.2 etc.)

<br><br><i>How to get inside libraries at night</i>
<br><br>
</center>Ah, Python! Maybe the most powerful programming language for the web.<br>
The following books about  python    
will today serve as "example queries".<br>
<br> 
 Note that finding <a href="books.htm">books</a>   on the web 
 is extremely <a target=_top href="http://digital.library.upenn.edu/books/search.html">easy</a>.   <br><br>
       In fact there's even a direct relation between the "celebrity" of a target and how easy it will be to find it on the web. 
       <br>For example: if you want <i>hic et nunc</i> 
       the "Lord of the ring", you just search for a passage of it: <a target=_top href="http://search.ask.com/web?q=%22At+last+the+voice+of+Faramir+ordered+them+to+be+uncovered%22&qsrc=1&o=0">At 
      last the voice of Faramir ordered them to be uncovered</a>. See? Even the heavy censored 
      <a href="http://beta.search.msn.com/results.aspx?q=%22At+last+the+voice+of+Faramir+ordered+them+to+be+uncovered%22&mkt=en-US&form=QBRE&go.x=8&go.y=12">MSNSearch</a> gives us 
      	some results. This is true for all books:  <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=opera&rls=en&q=%22But+few+of+any+sort+and+none+of+name%22&sourceid=opera&num=100&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8">"But few of any sort and none of name"</a> 
      	and you immediately have Shakespeare's "Much ado about nothing" 
      	(and, I may add, you discover <i>en passant</i> a lot of book repositories as well).

<br>
<br>
Hence finding books, patented or not, is extremely easy. Yet today's  "examples"  will give us -I hope- 
an opportunity to investigate  some alternative searching methods... some 
different ways of cutting the noise and getting the signal <u>without</u> just using google (or anyone of the many <a href="main.htm">main 
search engines</a>).<br><bR> 
The following three books will be our '<font color="#0000ff">virtual targets</font>':<br>
   <ol><li>                                                                               
<i><font color=blue>Core Python Programming</fonT></i> by Wesley J. Chun<br>   
	First Edition, Prentice Hall, December 14, 2000
ISBN: 0-13-026036-3, 816 pages. <br>Note that the new 1120 pages - September 2006 - second edition (Prentice Hall, ISBN: 0132269937) 
is too new to have already "percolated" the web, it's already 
out there all the same, of course, and you'll have to find it yourself (see the <a href="Luxembourg_2006.htm#fivee">assignment</a> section), 
but keep in mind that for a book  it takes usually a couple of months after its publication  to "sink in" the web. 
<br>
A good introduction  to python:  explains the language, and does put it in a wider context. (Incidentally: reversers should note 
 the usual tricks with the 
 font sizes: here so big that the book could be condensed to half it's size -or less- 
if the type was reduced to a normal level&nbsp;:-)</li><li>  
   <i><font color=blue>Python Cookbook</fonT></i> by Alex Martelli and David Ascher (O'Reilly,  ISBN: 0596001673),  2002<br>
   Advanced:  a collection of problems, solutions, and practical examples for Python programmers, written by Python programmers.
   In principle this book is for those that already know Python. In practice it's quite useful for anyone.
</li><li>

<i><font color=blue>Python Essential Reference</fonT></i> by David Beazley, (Sams, ISBN: 0672328623), 2006 <br>
Syntax, functions, operators, classes, and libraries. This is first and foremost a reference, yet quite useful if you have 
some experience with other programming languages.</li>
	</ol>
	Now, of course
	we all know that 'printed' books on such matters are often both obsolete as soon as printed and   quite superficial 
	vis-a-vis what you can find for free on the Web, 
	because we also know  that the best knowledge (and material) 
	 is to be found   instead 
	in some 'gray areas' of the web, or visiting 
	<a target=_top href="http://www.programmersheaven.com/c/MsgBoard/wwwboard.asp?Board=64">ad hoc  
	messageboards</a>  or   perusing <a target=_top href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.python?lnk=sg">Usenet</a> 
		emails. 
		<br>
		Moreover there is such a wealth of <a target=_top href="http://gnosis.cx/TPiP/">free useful texts</a> on the web that this fact alone 
		(<u>not</u> the fact 
		that you can easily find all these patented books for free) makes one wonder whether  nowadays
		  it makes   any sense at all to "buy" a book.
	<br>	
	<br>Again a caveat: the following queries are just a proof of concept,  showing 
	how we <u>could</u> search for books... the specific "quarries" (in this case our three 
	python books) don't matter that much: you'll be able to adapt the  following 
	approaches to OTHER, different, targets of yours...  
	
	    replace for instance "python" with -say- "assembly" or "digital photography" 
	    and you'll obtain a different complete library instead. <bR>
	    The approaches and the techniques we are examining together 
	    are important, the targets themselves are irrelevant.<center>
	<bR>    <font size=+3>Proximity galore</fonT></center>
	<bR>Another interesting side effect of a correct web-seeking approach 
	is  that often, when searching for something, you will find on the same servers 
	<font color=blue>many other targets related to your topic</font>, targets that you did not even know existed. While this is  true for many different targets and only for books, we call this 
	the "<font color="#0000ff">being inside the library</font>" effect. Imagine  you are  not filling out  
	a request form at the counter, imagine you are physically  
	retrieving a book <b>inside<u></u></b> a library,  with 
	shelves and shelves of books around you and within your immediate reach. 
	Thus you can scan with your eyes all <u><b>other</b></u> books in the proximity: books,  
	more or less related to the topic you are searching for, that are, imagine,  
	<font color=blue>located on the same shelf, next to your target book</fonT> 
	and that you can also pick  up  at leisure.  Gee... the amazing power of knowing how to search!
        <br><bR>
        Enough theory! A good <a href="rabbits.htm">webbit</a> for our  
        python books? Here a "regional" one (say: China): 
        <a target=_top href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&hl=en&lr=&rls=en&as_qdr=all&q=python+site%3A.cn+%22index%2Bof%22&btnG=Search">python site:.cn "index+of"</a>
<br>

       <br>Yep: searching for <a href="books.htm">books</a> on the web is -most of the time- extremely simple, especially if you 
       have the exact title, the name of the author, the ISBN number and/or some snippets of text.
       <br>

<i><font color=blue>Core Python Programming</fonT></i> by Wesley J. Chun<br>  <br>
       Please note that -in general- you find most books just inputting a title "tel quel" in any search engine: for instance a simple 
       query on the good (and still commercially not infected)  
       <a href="compound.htm">compound</a> search engine <a target=_top href="http://www.seekz.com">seekz</a>

       (note the underscores between the words)   
      will  almost immediately give us aplenty locations with the 
      complete version of <a target=_top href="http://lab.lpicn.org/pub/books/">Chun's nice book</a>.
      <br>On this same <a target=_top href="http://lab.lpicn.org/pub/books/">repository</a>   we register 
      the  "inside the library" phenomenon we discussed before: <u><b>19 further books on python</b></u>, 
      some of them crap, some of them good.<bR><br> 
       Alas! This "Core" target is  the old "2000" edition. 
        The new 1120 pages - September 2006 - second edition (Prentice Hall, ISBN: 0132269937) 
is more difficult to find, because too new to have already percolated the web: it takes (at most) a couple of months: 
you'll be anyway easily find it easily around December... but you may want to find it right now in order  
to solve today's <a href="Luxembourg_2006.htm#fivee">assignement</a>.</li>

<i><font color=blue>Python Essential Reference</fonT></i> by David Beazley
       <br> We start with a simple yahoo query:
       <a target=_top href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=%22Python+Essential+Reference%22+rapidshare&prssweb=Search&ei=UTF-8&x=wrt">"Python Essential Reference" rapidshare</a>
       and we almost immediately get (inter <u>many</u> alia) 
       <a target=_top href="http://doci.nnm.ru/it_ebooks_digest">a Russian promising URL</a>, 
       http://doci.nnm.ru/it_ebooks_digest,     that 
        gives us     on a silver plate 
       our third target (and many other as well, btw) . 
       <br>Bingo. Done. Finished. We could stop here.
       <br>
       As many among you will know, rapidshare is (an important one) among <a href="local.htm#reposi">HUNDREDS of file repositories</a> 
       services which  
       make money hosting porn crap and patented material 
       anyone can upload (they will 'remove it due to complaints' if needed) 
        fooling idiots into buying "special accounts" in order to download this 
       pirated and patented stuff/porn at leisure.
     <br>  However, the logic is that in order to fool the zombies they HAVE TO be known and HAVE TO lure people 
     into using them.<br>Therefore they HAVE TO provide a (often penalized and slower) 
       free download opportunity for everyone and his leeching dog. Apart from the many simple possibilities to bypass these 
       simple  penalizing scripts 
       (mostly written in php), the fact that there's now a huge industry thriving on the selling of patented  software/porn/film/music 
       material is very bad news for the poor & suffering patent holders.  Not that anyone would give a dead rat, he :-)

       When you search the web, the biggest problem is noise. Your target, your signal, will be often half-drowned underneath it.<br>
        And  today's web has  a lot of commercial noise.<br>    
        If you search for an image for instance, say a picture of a famous painter,  you will immediately find
        a gazillion spammers who want <u><font color="#000080">to sell  you</font></u> those very images  you could easily find for free.  
        <br>
         So you'll find thousand of low resolution images, or images defaced with an ugly watermark,  put on line 
         by "snake oil" sellers.  So "<font color="#0000ff">cutting the noise</font>" is crucial.
        <br> This holds true for everything, and for books as well.
        Hence we must "clean up" our queries a little, and, as the title of this conference: "searching underneath the commercial web" implies, a
        simple apprach is for instance to limit 
        our searches to "edu" and "org" sites.       
<br><br>
        The first query above will give us <a target=_top href="http://www.miex.org/book.html">this link</a> that brings 
        us in <a target=_top href="http://www.miex.org/python/">this
        subdirectory</a>, 
        and the second query will give us this  
        "<a target=_top href="http://forum.hackinthebox.org/login.php?redirect=viewtopic.php&t=11281&start=550&sid=875c400344e6ca492b54c1759e5f92f7">blocked link</a>", 
        yet  through google's <a href="http://66.249.93.104/search?q=cache:sgbriBuXbeoJ:forum.hackinthebox.org/viewtopic.php%3Ft%3D11281%26postdays%3D0%26postorder%3Dasc%26start%3D550%26sid%3D6fcb0d167424b24ebcdefb53e18597bf+Python-Cookbook+Python-Essential-Reference+%22Core+Python+Programming+%22+site:.org&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=3">cached copy</a>
        	 
        we will still be able to find  this nice 
        <a target=_top href="http://slav0nic.xss.ru/books/python/">Russian site</a>.  
        <br>(Note in this example <font color="#000080">the importance of cached copies</font>. 
        In fact most search engines offer them: Ask, MSNSearch, Yahoo, 
        Google, Alexa, Baidu, Gigablast...).
        	
        </ul>
<br><br>  
   
     So, that's it:  as you have seen, any and every book is at seekers' disposal.
       <br><br>
      

   <font color="#400080"> (<u>Caveat</u>: <font color="#191970">Download your targets only if you are positively sure they have been released 
on the public domain. 
Real seekers do not need to waste harddisk space downloading doubtful stuff. This could even be constructed as 'illegal' by the patent  
holders and their political lackeys. <font color=blue>Downloading is not necessary!</fonT> Seekers will always find again and again on the fly 
-and consult on line- 
whatever they fancy</fonT>).</font>
<br>      




<br>Ok, ok. It was too easy. Much too easy. In order to continue,  
let's imagine for a moment that it would NOT have been so incredibly easy to find these books through such simple searches. 
Imagine we didn't find them.  Imagine <font color="#000080">we will not</font> find them again on those  URLs. 
<br>After all, <font color=blue>the web is a quicksand</font>, and the specific locations where we found our  targets 
 after today's talk probably will disappear.

                                            		have  the

                                            		you want.     Note also how some <a href="magicfi.htm">guessing</a> can be useful 
                                            		when searching a target on the web. <br>
<br></li>
     <a name="lamers"></a>
<li>We could do it like  the <u>lamers</u>.<br>
  	
  	The lamers' slow way is simple: using <a href="ftp.htm">P2P</a> and torrents<br> Using <a href="p2p.htm#search">P2P specific search engines</a>  
     is a somehow slow, but mostly very simple way to find your targets.<bR>
     Let's <I>exempli gratia</i> give <a target=_top href="http://www.filedonkey.com/search">filedonkey</a> a chance:   
     let's just input <a target=_top href="http://www.filehash.com/search/core+python/::ad">core python</a> and see what we fish. See?<br>
     Another "lame but valid" possibility is of course to check what the 
     <a target=_top href="http://www.bitenova.nl/search.php">torrents</a> can deliver 
     when  searching -say- <a target=_top href="http://www.torrentspy.com/search?query=python&submit.x=0&submit.y=0">python</a>.
     <bR>
     A lot of monty python as you can see, but also all our targets as well. In order to reduce the monty noise 
     you can make the same search and limit the max size of the file to, say, <a href="http://www.torrentspy.com/search?mode=advanced&query=python&submit=Advanced+Search&mcat=0&scat=0&minf=&maxf=150&mins=&maxs=&mind=&maxd=">150 mega</a> 
     (note the <font color="#0000ff">&maxf=150</font> snippet in the searchstring).<br>
     Anyhow real seekers        <font color=blue>deprecate</fonT>   P2P and Torrents "searches". they are considered too slow and vulgar. 
     It is always 
     <font color=blue>much quicker</fonT>  <u>and  more elegant</u>     
     to fetch your targets from locations    nobody is visiting, than to slowly download them from overwhelmed servers together with 
     a zillion other zombies doing the same thing.

Using <a href="ftp.htm#search">ftp specific search engines</a> is in many cases a useful way to quickly find your targets.
Let's give <a target=_top href="http://www.files.lt/?">our Lithuanian friends</a> a chance:   let's just input <font color=blue>python</fonT> 
and choose as format <font color="#0000ff">pdf</font>.<br>
Here we have only three results: <font color=blue>A.D.S.Lessa - Python Developer's Handbook.pdf</fonT>, 
<font color="#000080">Apress.Beginning.Python.From.Novice.to.Professional.Sep.2005.pdf</font>  
and        
<font color=blue>John.Wiley.and.Sons.Making.Use.of.Python.pdf</fonT>. 
<br>
BUT, if we repeat the same search for the <font color="#000080">rar</font> format:<br><font size=-1>  
<a href="ftp://anonymous@202.96.64.144/pub/books/%28ebook%20-%20HTML%20-%20Python%29%20O%27Reilly%20-%20Core%20Python%20%5Bfound%20via%20ww.rar">ftp://anonymous@202.96.64.144/pub/books/%28ebook%20-%20HTML%20-%20Python%29%20O%27Reilly%20-%20Core%20Python%20%5Bfound%20via%20ww.rar</a><br></fonT> 
(and of course all the other books as well).<bR>So, when searching, choosing the "right" format is quite important.
  <br><bR>
  </li>
  
    

     <a name="local"></a>
<li> 
	
	Going <a href="local.htm">local</a> (<a href="local.htm">Homepages, Usenet, topic-related messageboards, blogs, forums & webrings</a>)<br> 
 At times it can be useful to "throw a narrow net" inside the searchscape, going  "specific".<br> 
 Searching <a target=_top href="http://s2.webring.com/cgi-bin/hubsearch?search">webrings</a>  gives no results, but 
on <a href="usenet.htm">usenet</a> you have 
 <a target=_top href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/comp.lang.python/topics?lnk=srg&hl=en">comp.lang.python</a> (a high-volume Usenet open newsgroup for general discussions and questions about 
 Python), 
 <a target=_top href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/comp.lang.python.announce/topics?lnk=srg&hl=en">comp.lang.python.announce</a>

(a low-volume moderated forum for Python-related announcements, useful to keep up to date) 
and <a target=_top href="http://groups-beta.google.com/groups/dir?lnk=srgmb&q=python&hl=en">quite a lot</a> of local or regional python newsgroups.
 <bR>                                              
    
 <br>     
We could also Search private homepages
 like  <a target=_top href="http://us.geocities.yahoo.com/search?p=python+programming">geocities</a> 
 or <a target=_top href="http://search.lycos.com/index.php?adv=1&dfi=tripod.com&src=af&query=python">Tripod</a> 
 for "python".   <br><bR>
 A further very good idea is to spot  
 relevant and authoritative topic-related messageboards <a target=_top href="http://europython.org/">conference proceedings</a> 
 and/or <a href="blog.htm">blogs</a>. There you may even find topic-related fora, 
 like  for instance <a target=_top href="http://python-forum.org/py/index.php">python-forum.org</A> 
 and   <a target=_top href="http://lowlife.jp/cgi-bin/moin.cgi/PythonProgrammersWeblog">programmers' weblogs</a>.<bR>
 It is also worth repeating <i>ad nauseam</i> that on the web much knowledge can be found in "grey areas" that are completely outside the "academic circuits". 
 Indeed, if you are  interested in python, you'll soon realise that the  books we have chosen as targets today are   already quite 
  obsolete, 
 and almost irrelevant, if compared to the free huge knowledge you can gather by visiting the messageboards, usenet groups 
 and fora pointed out above.
 
   <br><bR>

   <a name="regional"></a>
   <li>Going <a href="regional.htm">regional</a><br><table border="0" width=88%><tr><td><font size=+1>  
    Going "regional" is ALWAYS a very good idea when searching. We have already seen how adding a simple <font color=blue>.ru</font> to 
  our queries can help. But why Russia? WHERE should we search? Which are the, how should I say? the "less copyright-obsessed" countries? 
  <a href="images/piracy.gif" ALT="red" align="bottom" valign="bottom" WIDTH="270" HEIGHT="634">Here</a>

      We may as well use these 'scarecrow' data (produced by

      And look! As you can see,      Vietnam, Zimbabwe, Indonesia, China, Pakistan, Kazakistan, Ukraine, Cameroon, 
      Russia, Bolivia, Paraguay and Algeria seem  to have a more relaxed attitude towards   
        patent holders. Good to know&nbsp;:-)<bR>
      Here the relevant <a target=_top href="http://www.iana.org/cctld/cctld-whois.htm">country codes</a>:

             codes, that we could use to <font color=blue>restrict searches</fonT> <u><b>only</b></u> and/or 
             <u><b>especially</b></u> to such relaxed places.
             <bR>
             Of course some of these countries are just tiny local niches, with next to no activity and 
             extremely weak signals, and can be ignored: throwing our clever queries in -say- Zimbabwe or Cameroon 
             we'll probably just wasting our (or our <a href="bots.htm">bots</a>) precious searching time.. 
             <bR>
             Let's say that -in general-    
             <font color=blue>.vn</fonT>(Vietnam),
             <font color=blue>.id</fonT> (Indonesia),   <font color=blue>.cn</fonT> (China),  <font color=blue>.pk</fonT> (Pakistan),
                      <font color=blue>.ua</fonT> (Ukraine) and   <font color=blue>.ru</fonT> (Russia) look promising enough.  We may add
                      -out of our experience-   
                      Iran, Korea, Bulgaria and India (<font color=blue>.ir</fonT>, <font color=blue>.kr</fonT>, <font color=blue>.bg</fonT> and <font color=blue>.in</fonT>).

Searching through <acronym title="Internet Relay Chat -  a multi-user chat system, where people convene on 'channels'">IRC</acronym> channels 
and blogs can be -for specific targets- quite useful.       However the ratio noise/signal is
quite bad on these channels, and therefore IRC-searching and blog-searching is -in many cases- a 
waste of time if compared to more effective searching 
techniques. 
    <br>After all, and behind the hype, blogs are just messageboards where only the Author can start a thread, and IRC channels need, in order to be useful, a lot of 
    social engineering.
<bR>I'll just direct you to some

        At times simply switching to less known (but quite interesting) search engines can cut mustard. 
        <br>Here's a related search with

       <br>
       Finally, since we are speaking of a programming language, we may also  have a look at the recent google codesearch:<br>
       <a target=_top href="http://www.google.com/codesearch?hl=en&lr=&q=return+lang%3Apython&btnG=Search">return lang:python</a> gives 283000

       So we found our targets again and again using a palette of different searching colours. These are all paths that lead into 
       the forest, and you'll be able to find many more on your own. Now let's go back to the theory.

<i>Google alone and you're never done</i>
<br><br>
</center>

     Google's results, after many years of legendary quality, are
now  being spammed more and more.<br> 
Using a plethora of methods (cloaking, doorway pages, hidden text, blog-farms, you name it) 
the  <a href="links.htm#SE0beasts">SEO beasts</a> ("search engines optimizators" 
they have the cheek to call themselves) deny everybody the possibility to gather  real knowledge 
pushing up 
their crap commercial sites into the first positions of the <acronym title="Search Engines Result Pages">SERP</acronym>s.<br>
	<br>
      <table><tr>
      	<td align=left><center>

<td> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</tD>
      	<td>
<font size=+1>  


Of course you can apply some <a href="nemo_SEO.htm">countermeasures</a>: 
users -rather than spammers- should be able to influence the ranking of search results and some 
search engines (MSNsearch's until a few months ago had beautiful 
<a href="http://search.msn.com/results.aspx?q=%7Bfrsh%3D94%7D+%7Bpopl%3D20%7D+%7Bmtch%3D99%7D+rapidshare.de%2Ffiles+google&FORM=QBRE">sliders</a> 
-now MSNlive has  
 <a target=_top href="http://gallery.live.com">macros</a> though- 
and Yahoo still has <a target=_top href="http://mindset.research.yahoo.com/search.php?p=%22advanced+web+searching%22&t=2.00">philtron</a>)  
provide users with the opportunity 
to influence -at least rudimentary- the  ranking algorithms. 
<br>
A notorious case is the infamous 'popularity' ranking criterion. This you should by all means avoid or slide to insignificancy, since 
it is <i>eo ipso</i> tantamount to crappiness.
<br>
 Contrary to 
what search engines' algos designer still seem to believe,  <font color=blue>TURNING POPULARITY DOWN</fonT> if given half a 
chance, is very important, since for  humans with brains what -say-  some idiots in Idaho are massively looking for 
has no relevance whatsoever.   "Sites popular for zombies" are exactly those sites that you will never need. Remember the beautiful 
 old trick of adding a <font color=blue>site:edu</fonT> or <font color=blue>site:org</fonT> specification to all your searchstrings per default: 
 all the "<font color="#000080">com</font>" sites will disappear: good riddance.


</td></tR></table>  
 <bR><br>
 For search engines that do not allow any algo fine-tuning, a possible defensive approach is the "<a href="yoyo1.htm">yo-yo</a>" approach: 
 jumping  from the start 
 onto lower <acronym title="Search Engines Result Pages">SERP</acronym>s and then going slowly back up.
<br><br> 
Such methods can soon prove 
even more crucial for Internet searching purposes:
 while google may not be yet a sinking boat, anyone can  
see how much water is already leaking through its many spammed holes. <br><br>
So we have <font color=blue>to refine our seeking techniques</font>.
<br>
Instead of just using google again and again, every time  we 
begin a search, we should 
carefully consider <font color=blue>how and where</font>  we start our searches, delve a little more 
inside 
our own specific requirements, and avoide wasting too much time 
on irrelevant side paths... <IMG SRC="images/bulletr.gif" ALT="red" align="bottom" valign="bottom" WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="13">&nbsp; &nbsp;

<br><br><i>
Quaeras ut possis, quando non quis ut velis</i>
<br><br>

<br>There are various strategies you can use when searching the web.
Some are more relevant for <a href="longtermsearching.htm">LONG TERM</A> searching, some 
on the contrary, for <a href="tips.htm">SHORT TERM</A> searching.
<br>  But even the various simple techniques we used today (searching 
for mp3s and books) can and should be used together with the <a href="quickforms.htm">main</a> 
search engines.       On the ever moving web-quicksands 
it does not make much sense to give a list of links to places where you can 
"search alternatives". It is better, I believe, to  (try to) show directly how to "search alternatively". 
<br><br>
Of course there are various important <u>non commercial</u> databases, like Infomine (<a target=_top href="http://infomine.ucr.edu">http://infomine.ucr.edu</a>), 
Librarians Internet Index (<a target=_top href="http://lii.org">http://lii.org</a>), The Internet Public Library (<a target=_top href="http://www.ipl.org/">http://www.ipl.org/</a>) Resource Discovery Network (<a target=_top href="http://rdn.ac.uk">http://rdn.ac.uk</a>), 
Academic Info (<a target=_top href="http://www.academicinfo.net/">http://www.academicinfo.net/</a>), The Front (for journals: <a target=_top href="http://www.arxiv.org/multi?group=math&%2Ffind=Search">http://www.arxiv.org/multi?group=math&%2Ffind=Search</a>)
and finally the best one of all: The Open Directory Project (<a target=_top href="http://dmoz.org">http://dmoz.org</a>).<br>
These are all  
possible alternatives to a single approach limited to the <a hre="main.htm">main</a> search engines.   <br><br>
Yet lists of links  are and remain just that: lists of links. Bound to decay into 
obsolescence. 
<bR>We have seen some alternative approaches. Practice them on your own subjects and interests. Once you learn how to seek, the world is yours. 
Cosmic power for free.

<br>
		An easy assignment for this evening:
(just in order to practice the various techniques explained today, lest you forget everything):  
find <u><b><font color=blue>the new 1120 pages - September 2006 - second edition</fonT></b></u> 
of our target <i>Core Python Programming</i> by Wesley J. Chun,    (Prentice Hall, ISBN: 0132269937)<br>
This search should take you at most 10 minutes if done now (and just a few seconds in a couple of months, 
when the book will have percolated the Web).

<bR><bR>
    And now I'm finished. 
    <bR>Thank-you for your patience. Any questions?
