<B>further observations on <FONT COLOR=RED>advert.dll</FONT> </B>
<br>by Green Newbie<br>
<hr>
<BR>here is what my observations of how advert.dll works and what
it does so far:<BR><BR><BR><BR>tonite I started my News Shark
<U>before</U> I fired AtGuard up and <BR>observed the creation of
a folder named <FONT COLOR=RED>amc</FONT> inside <BR><FONT
COLOR=RED>C:\Windows</FONT> The folder is where <FONT
COLOR=RED><BR>advert.dll</FONT> sent <BR>all the gif ads. here are
the offending places sending the ads:<BR><BR><BR> www.amazon.com  
kansas.valueclick.com  www.cdnow.com  www.teknosurf3.com<BR>     
offline.adsoffware.com   adsoffware.com   aim1.adsoftware.com
and<BR> ads.admaximize.com<BR> <BR><BR><BR>I started adding all
those places to my <FONT COLOR=RED>Hosts</FONT> file, <BR>but the
ads continued appearing. then i suddently remembered the
trick<BR>to make a 0 (zero) bites file called <FONT
COLOR=RED>amc</FONT> with<BR> <U>NO EXTENTIONS</u> -that's
important - and I placed that file inside<BR> <FONT
COLOR=RED>C:\Windows</FONT>. That worked and the ads stopped
coming down.<BR> Apperantly the stupid <FONT
COLOR=RED>advert.dll</FONT> <BR>(you can find it inside  <FONT
COLOR=RED>C:\Windows\System\</FONT>) which <BR>is responsible for
the ads will be trying to create that same folder with<BR> the
same name inside <FONT COLOR=RED>C:\Windows</FONT>, but won't be
able <BR>to, he-he.<BR> NOTE: <U>do NOT</U> try to mess with <FONT
COLOR=RED>advert.dll</FONT>, <BR>that file is needed for <FONT
COLOR=RED>News Shark</FONT> to run.<BR><BR><br><BR><BR>Anyone care
to add more info to this?...<BR><BR>P.S Sorry, my English is
especially bad today.
