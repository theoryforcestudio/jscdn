<i>Ocean shipping may jolly well be "the biggest real-time datastreaming network
in the world", yet 
as most of my readers probably know, it is not (by far) the only case where
hopelessy incompetent
people are happily taking wrong decisions around us (ever visited a bank?) nor
it is the
only case of incompetent
people  happily taking wrong decisions where when
one digit of a number becomes wrong huge sums become lost (ever
visited a bank?). That's the main rule for the commercial world 
around us, I am afraid: survival 
of the 'moronests'. Enjoy this good <font color=blue>reality cracking</font> ~ <font color=blue>propaganda countering</fonT> ~

<TR><TD><center><P><font size=+2>Truth Searching: the Chechnya example</font><bR>by
-IPFreely
<bR>March 2000</P></center>

<P>As an enterprising young peasant, it was a real eye opener when
I began hauling the global economy from a California port with my
own
trucking company. I was exposed to so many layers of lies between
the dock unions, shipping companies, government, and the companies
I
contracted for. It was here that I learned the true nature of
capitalism and the greed that fuels it. My searching for truth on
the
internet began at this time and I learned so much about these
organisations that it made me sick. I sold most of my possessions
including my
business and now spend most of my time planning my escape from
this country and searching for the truth about the world around
me. It is amazing
what truths can be uncovered when one decides to look. Before I
get into the main focus of this essay, I'd like to make a note to
the
technologically advanced readers of this site. The containerised
shipping industry has one of the biggest information technology
systems in the
economy today. It is my experience that the operators of these
systems are poorly trained and the majority of people that I met
in the shipping industry
struck me as pretty low quality low intelligence people. When one
digit of a number becomes wrong the load becomes lost. I have
tried to deliver loads that were supposed to be
delivered thousands of miles away and were only found when they
got to the wrong place. It then takes forever to sort out, hint
hint hint. Explore your world hehe.
Wired magazine did a great piece on it:7.10-October 1999
<font color=blue>[</font><a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/7.10/ports.html">http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/7.10/ports.html</a><font color=blue>]</font> </P>
<P>As my searches began to uncover more and more hypocrisy and
outright lies within the global corporate climate, I began to
investigate the role of governments in all of this.
Recently my attention has shifted toward the Russian genocide of
the people of Chechnya and the cause of the western governments' 
suspicious silence about these matters. By investigating this
situation on the internet it is possible for you to uncover the
lies and vulgarity intrinsic in <u>all</u> the worlds "conflicts" during the last 20
years (and more if you keep digging). I would suggest trying to
focus your own pursuit on the last 20 years so as to stay in touch
with the present issues. By doing this you will begin to see
through all of the crap that youve been fed by corporate media and
will begin to
see it as a giant exploitation by those with money that crave
power. Far from being an 'urban legend' this matter of fact will 
emerge with great clarity, snippet after snippet. Try it for yourself 
if you don't believe me. Find a newspapers coverage of the Vietnam war (any 
western newspaper will do, there are NO exception to the "lies, lies and 
even more lies just in case" rule).<bR> Thousands and thousands of innocent people become the chess
pawns in this disgusting game of monopoly.<bR>
Once more, dont just take my word for
it however: I'll use here 
the war in Chechenya as a "springboard" but you may yourself 
begin your own journey
for truth beneath the hollow layer of all these "dot com" mania. May suggestion is 
to use this site
to sharpen your searching skills, and learn evaluate the world from many
different perspectives.</P>
<P>The following examples contain topics to look for that will
yield many gems for our reversing work. What is most interesting - and striking - however,
are <u>the voices that are absent</u>. They are the ones working "behind
the scenes" and evaluating how to
influence the battle for their own benefit. These silent
voices turn up the heat of carnage.  

<UL TYPE="square">

<P><LI>The Chechens do some reversing.<BR>
"Battered rebels flee ruined Grozny Chechen fighters are beaten
back but remain unbowed, The Times (01 Feb 2000)"<BR> Janine
di Giovanni fails to mention the 'battered' Russians whose '20
losses a day' bodies will soon be shown on insha-Allah web-sites.
 She uses the term 'flee' which is used for cowards,
and fails to mention that in some occasions the Russians 
have 'fled' at such speed that they even leaved
 wounded soldiers behind. She says 'beaten back' but fails to 
remember that the Russian force (ten times their adversaries number) 
was held 
two weeks during the "Minutka Square" battle. Finally, she ends
with 'unbowed', failing to understand that the Mujahideen do
not and will not bow down to anyone except Allah. 
<bR>Moreover history loves to repeat itself again and again, 
and  August
1996 is not a past-forgotten date. In that month 1500 
Mujahideen surrounded 10,000 Russian demoralized 
soldiers, in Grozny, and won the last war.</P>

<P><LI>"I found his style refreshing and open and his priorities
ones that we share."
      British Foreign Minister Robin Cook speaking about 
the Russian premier Vladimir Putin, Moscow, 23 February 2000<BR><LI>NOTE that
Russia has
been receiving enormous amounts of money from the NATO governments
during this war.</P>

<P><LI> International human rights groups are stepping
up their criticism of alleged atrocities committed by
Russian troops in Chechnya.  The French ngos 
<a href="http://www.msf.org/projects/europe/russia/">Medecins sans frontieres</a> 
and   
Doctors
of the World (Medicins du Monde) have denounced 
"massive and systematic war crimes".  The New
York-based Human Rights Watch has published the names
of 50 civilians killed this month in what it calls "a
pattern of summary executions" in the Chechen capital,
Grozny.  V-O-A's Peter Heinlein visited Grozny and
reports that evidence of large-scale killing and
looting is not hard to find.<BR>
<LI>Hmmm and where is the United States' rhetoric and support like
that which was displayed for Kuwait and ethnic Albanians? A search
into the war on Iraq will reveal
that the US set up the whole thing in order to gain control over
the region's oil. In this situation the U.S. government has a
different agenda and therefore it pays to keep low profile 
vis-a-vis the Russians. Not that the United States have much Authority 
to say anything on these matters anyway: the US have been
convicted of <u>war crimes</u> of their own by many 
international tribunals but
you wont know, nor find this truth out, until you dig a lot.<bR>
But once you dig you'll find, and what you'll find out is -at least 
for me - utterly amazing. And I'm not speaking about propaganda sites 
or kiddies with "urban legend"-style conspiration theories.<bR>
There are many well documented
reports written by scholars from all over ther world that have
published on the internet. They tend to support all of their
findings with facts and even provide cross referencing in many
cases. The truth is out there.</P>



<P><LI>The typical Russian snow job.<BR>
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov accused the West
on Thursday of waging an <u>information war</u> against Moscow over its
military campaign in breakaway Chechnya.
   Ivanov said Western media had shown <u>only one side</u> of the situation
in the
region, misleading public opinion.
   ''Ninety percent of Chechen territory has been freed from
terrorists.
Life is <u>returning to normal</u> there. Sowing (for a new harvest) is
underway,'' he said.
   ''Life is difficult, but it is being restored. One should talk
about
this, not about <u>civilian deaths</u>.''<BR>
<LI>You'll find this kind of thetoric all over the wars. "returning to normal", 
"life being restored". Same assertions during the US napalm bombings in Vietnam, 
the NATO "strafexpeditions" in Yugoslavija, the government instigated 
riots in many South-East Asian countries. <bR>
You can bet that if China bombs Taiwan next week, life will be soon 
"return to normal" there too.<bR>
Yet after having see the pictures of what is left in these places, this kind 
of statements are not only worthless, they are cynical, or may be sarcastic.</P>

</UL>




<P>For pictures of death and destruction (a picture is worth a thousand words, eh) 
that you <u>will not see</u> on
regular censorted media, you will have to hunt and dig. I have found that there
are <u>many archives of images</u> but they have to be brought to the
surface using your searchers' skills. Here is an example of one that I have found on
tripod.com<BR>
"This section contains photographs taken by the foreign Mujahideen
in Chechnya during their
operations against the Russian Army" <BR> You will need
to use <u>the keywords from this phrase</u> (or the whole phrase) in order to
bring the images to the surface. By
using "one sided perspectives" that you have gained from your earlier searches,
you may easily come up with an idea of what their descriptions
might be.<bR> Another
way is to try to guess filenames (such as LINK:mujahideen.jpg or
deadivan.jpg) etc. Upon finding images, you should always view the source
to see if they are hosted locally
or <u>if they are being pulled from another address</u>. Sometimes you
can score a whole database this way.<br> Also back up the local url
and see if you can get an index listing of the images file.
If they dont have a default index page for it then you hit payload and 
can see all
the files they have, available for viewing. Remember that searching
is not (yet :-) an exact science. I found the above archive
on one of my digs, however I cant seem to find it again by just
using my preferite enginew (I have found many other related things, though).<bR> 
I
instead had to search my browser history to verify that it is
still there. Im
not going to post the url because these pages may have moved by
the time you read this and they are worth finding on your own.
They even have small movies of their combat actions. I am
confident
that they will be findable in one place or another by using this
sites techniques and following your leads.</P>
<P>Just as a psychic summons the spirits to see into a crystal
ball, a searcher uses qualifiers to see into the crystal box.
Propaganda reversing is an excellent example of why qualifiers are
so
important to the searcher. By determing one sides perspective we
can give the keywords a positive or negative value based on
whether we want to filter out one side while allowing <u>a better
selection of the
other sides' voices to surface</u> or vice versa. For instance, lets say we are
trying to find some of Russia's propaganda sites. In that case we 
would add a + sign
before the keywords <font color=blue>+terrorists</font>, and <font color=blue>+"apartment 
bombs"</fonT> and at the same time, to
filter out the chechen side we would add
 a negative sign to their key words <font color=blue>-jihad</font>, <<font color=blue>-"holy war"</font> 
etc. You dig it.<bR> Our
first querystring might look like this<br><font color=blue>grozny chechnya +terrorist
+"apartment bombings" -"holy war" -allah</font>.</P>
<P>As you can see it is important to work various angles with your
qualifiers to summon the best references to the surface. A
logically planned search can rip through all the garbage and get
you what you want a lot faster. I happen to be
one that appreciates the internet for its audio and video display
capabilities. There are many tricks to find linked file content
and they can be learned by reading other essays on this site. I
encourage you to seek 'photo galleries'
of these wars. It is easy to turn your back when its not local but
when you see for yourself the fresh corpses it is easy to
realize that it could be you or someone you know. The same trick is used on 
tv to 'mobilize' people against the baddies, but here, where you dig on 
your own and FIND OUT on your own, and decide alone which 
parameter you use (so you are guided by your brain and seekers' instinct and 
capacities) the matter is different. You may be fooled as well, granted, 
but it will be MUCH more difficoult: see you are accessing "raw" information 
that you are NOT even "supposed" to see. That's the magic of the web, and while 
this can lead to targeted disinformation campaigns as well (of course) it gives 
a true seeker (which is what you are supposed to be) a formidable 
weapon against the powers that be: some small sparkling snippets of truth.
<bR><bR>For once the dead 
corpses you will find will matter  <u>for you</u>, not 

for the power brokers. As you know, with some exceptions that 
only confirm this well-knownw rule, 
most politicians in our commercial society <u>are owned</u> by
 business forces,  so seek the truth and find on your own (and denounce) 
these "corporate
sponsored" crimes against humanity. <BR>
