Ok, so all the cures I had to undergo for almost two years: two complete and quite debilitating 
chemotherapy cycles, 4 operations, many biopsies, uncounted PET scans and  
MRIs, months spent inside a clinic... <font  color="#0000FF">did not work out</font>. 
<br>The metastases escaped from the throat: my dutch 
professor managed to stop everything but not 
the liver tumour, and my liver is now imploding. So it is a matter of weeks, not even months.<br> 
My remaining choices are to die in a clinic, to die home or to ask for euthanasia 
(the last I will of course do if 
needs arise... fortunately this is a civilised EU-country and religious 
nuts don't have here -at least for now- enough power to nuke my rights just 
to appease and placate the alleged wishes of their dubious godzilla).
<br><br>
I'll go for home: it seems (<a href="spring2009.htm">again: this ubiquitous "seem"</a>) that I will die while 
asleep. I will "just" get weaker (<u>and yellower</u>, gosh: nothing 
like a terminal tumour to become really ugly) until one day 
I won't wake up any more. If so, fair enough: you go with a gentle puff on your final trip, an experience that btw is 
usually reported as unique and unrepeatable</i>&nbsp;:-)<i>
<br><br>
Anyway if universe and time are really infinite (which I somehow doubt), then an almost 
"metempsicotically identical" combination of neurons will 
re-appear again somewhere, e.g. on another galaxy and planet... hopefully one with less imbeciles.

More realistically, I regret not having the time to accompany my kids when they will soon enter university. A part of me should live on 
through them, though, 
and I think I did manage to give them some powerful weapons & parachutes (see below) to prepare for the ugly times 
that anyone with a brain above eggplant level 
can now easily see against the horizon: The powers that be of our "oh so nice" society have managed 
to provoke the biggest pyramid scheme in economic history 
(IMF, 21/04/2009: US bank losses at almost 3 <u>trillions</u>; total world bank losses 4 trillions...  
no small peanuts he!) all money that -&ccedil;a va sans dire- poors and slaves will have now to mend and repay!
<br>As an added bonus in the mean time
they also managed to destroy  
-probably irremediably- 
the whole planet's ecosystem</i>&nbsp;:-|<i><br><br>
 Now, with the deafening chorale of their corrupted politicians and ecstatic media corybants, the only solution they 
all happily propose (further wasting for their own sake hundreds of billions that in fact belong to you) is to kick-start again  
<font  color="#0000FF">the same moronic cycle of forced credit | forced consum</font>... instead 
of questioning a model of development that utterly failed and is already now (and rightly) biting everyone on his ass.
<br>But that's nothing alas: I fear that the massacres, wars and 
concentration camps of the next decades will have us remembering the horrors of the first half of the XX century with mild nostalgia.<br>
Our "oh so nice and oh so democratic" societies (where nowadays only 
soubrettes, body builders, media owners and "the richest bozo in the pond" tend to 
be elected by a population of zombified slaves happy to run inside their guinea pig wheels) 
are headed at full speed on a steep slippery slope   
towards the  
chasm, where they will perform -smirking as usual- their final reverse three-and-a-half somersault, among the hurrahs! and viva! of their  
paid media-lackeys... before splashing aloud on the concrete reality pavement below.
<br><br></i>
<div align="center"><font size="+3" color="#0000FF">~ Sweet ~</font></div><i>
<br>Enough messages of doom: to be angry just because you die would be childish. 
And in fact I am not even angry, just analyzing and rambling 
aloud.<br>
Anyway some (albeit weak) weapons to defend yourself are there for the take, scattered 
on the deep web, our fathomless cornucopia of knowledge. 
<bR>The most powerful ones
are imho a sound knowledge of <a href="http://humanities.byu.edu/rhetoric/Silva.htm">rhetoric</a></i>
(<font size=-1><sup><a href="swansong.htm#note2">Note 2</a></sup></font>)<i><br>Especially 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphemism">euphemisms</a>, which nowadays <a href="images/if-21april.jpg">can betray a comic sarcasm</a>... 
 and <a href="exegesis.htm">exegesis</a>, and maybe also 
some sound (if rough and home-made) <a href="realicra/realicra.htm">reality cracking</a>. <br>
Poetry -and more generally 
a sound general culture- are also quite helpful armors. 
<br>Learn how to find good <a href="books.htm">books</a> (see <a href="swansong.htm#preferred_books">below</a> for 
some suggestions), you'll 
need them -like the medieval monks did once upon a time- while the barbarians burn everything and everyone 
in sight outside the walls. 
<br>More generally, never underestimate all sciences "in decadence", they are often quite powerful 
resources, lowballed (or even forbidden) <u>on purpose</u> by those that want you to just 
work, drool before a TV screen and consume consume consume... <font color="#0000FF">wasting your whole life 
in order to be able to buy slightly sooner a car of a different color</font>.<bR><br>
Two other possible parachutes are knowing <u>how to <a href="softreve.htm">reverse engineer software</a></u> (whose 
role in our societies and their petty 
censorships and sniffing attempts is bound to increase dramatically), and a sound 
learning of 
more than "just that one" <u>foreign language</u>. These "parachutes" could allow many 
readers to (maybe) fall on their feet. 
<br>Good luck anyway. I do wish  all the best  to anyone with a brain.
<br><br>
Yet <font  color="#0000FF">my most cherished advice to all friends</font> is the following: learn to enjoy your contingent present, don't be obsessed by 
the future. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpe_diem">Carpe diem</a>, and enjoy the current emotions: 
a starry sky, a fresh wind, the shells on the seashore, your 
love at your side in the night, a long talk in the evening twilight with a friend, the smile of your kids. 
Substituting *that* with 
a TV -or a computer screen- is a very poor bargain... that is one of the few things I am now pretty sure of.
<br>
<br>
Bye bye to all my readers, a big hug to the many friends I made all over the world. 
A great experience for me! I'll carry on as far as I manage, I'll even try to held 
a last <a href="mines.htm">talk in K&ouml;ln</a> end May, but I doubt I'll manage it, and
anyway soon  
my sites won't be updated anymore, unless my friends will take care and 
devise some sort of wiki/blog (and monitoring & corrections facilities) 
to allow this. We will see.<br>But do not worry in the least: If you did learn how to search you'll find other good resources anyway. 
There are aplenty around after all. 
<br>Yes! There's sound knowledge on the web, 
albeit hidden and buried behind or beneath slimy morasses of useless frills, moving dunes of commercial 
crap and an incredible amount of  
content-empty and utterly useless "bait" advertisement sites. <br>Yet the web <a href="images/indexed_web2009_2.jpg">very 
structure</a> was made for sharing, 
not for hoarding and surely not for "selling", never forget it! Therefore 
searchers may take advantage of this... <font color="#0000FF">A good knowledge of the main 
web-protocols, a good browser 
and our trusted <a href="http://www.wireshark.org/">wireshark</a></font> 
and no one 
is gonna stop a mighty seeker from finding whatever he fancies</i>&nbsp;:-)<i>
<br>
<br>Granted  there's indeed a lot of obsolete stuff on searchlores,  
 and -as already stated- the byzantine-labyrinthine structure of the site should have been streamlined long ago.
<br>However, even if partly obsolete (but real knowledge is seldom obsolete, isn't it?) 
I have decided to leave  on line everything I gathered and offered along many years <font color=blue>as it is and as 
long as it will remain on the web</font>, because I believe there's still a great wealth of free 
searching knowledge here, <a href="index.htm">awaiting</a> those 
among my visitors that are interested in learning and mastering 
the difficult twin arts of searching the web and reversing everything they find.<br><br>If -as some say- people all over our planet  
did and will learn using what I offered, my life was not wasted</i>&nbsp;:=)

I wonder if it makes any sense to publish some "ramblings" of mine like this, "spicing" them with 
some small web-searching examples, tips and links that could even be useful for the educated seeker.

<br><br>

<a name="note2"><font size="+1" color="#0000FF">Note 2</font></a><bR>
Most <u>original sources</u> can be easily found on the web and -frankly- when you can read the 
real sources yourself, why should you read at all what somebody else wrote about them?&nbsp;:-) 

<br>
Here, just two examples... 
<ul><li><a href="http://www.intratext.com/IXT/LAT0377/_P1.HTM">Juan Luis Vives
De Ratione Dicendi</a>, Bruges, 1532 in Opera Omnia, ed. Gregorio Mayans ý Siscar (Valencia, 1782), 2.93-297, 
found in an "unpatentable" edition<br>As a sidenote: the bastards of 
the US-EU patent's mafias managed now to 
bring retroactively patents effects to 70 years, but here we are more than two centuries ago, out 
of their dirty hands, yokes and deeds&nbsp;:-}<br> 
I also observe and constate -with balmy feelings of regret- that despite the patent's mafias best malevolent efforts, of course
 all sources and literature can still be easily found in some "gray" areas of 
the web, for instance using techniques and approaches described everywhere on the web and also 
in my <a href="mines.htm">conferences</a> and in the <a href="books.htm">books 
searching lore</a> section.
<br><br>
</li><li>
Here, fully legit, The Rhetorica ad Herennium: <a href="http://scrineum.unipv.it/wight/herm1.htm">original latin</a>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8226;&#8226; &nbsp;  &nbsp; 
<a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/home.html">english translation</a>.
<br> "Rhetorica ad Herennium" is a derivative of Greek rhetorical theory, 
this "<a href="http://rhetoric.byu.edu/primary%20texts/Ad%20Herennium.htm">treatise</a> was broadly influential in Roman antiquity, throughout the middle ages, 
and particularly in Renaissance rhetorical theory. 
<u>Its fourth book, in particular, contained a detailed dictionary of rhetorical figures to which countless future authorities turned</u>".
<br>
However if in doubt about the legitimity of such approaches in the country 
you and your <a href="proxy.htm">proxies</a> are compelled to live in, <font size="2" color="#0000FF">just (re-)find and read the texts on line whenever you feel like it</font>, 
instead of useless hoarding them on your harddisks... it's always quicker&nbsp;:-)
