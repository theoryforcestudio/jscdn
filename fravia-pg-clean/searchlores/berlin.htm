Six steps to web searching perfection<br>(Wizard searching for dummies)</td>
<td><font size=+1>This workshop   has one main aim: teach to young (and not so young) 
people, aware of the potential of the web, how to find anything they would care for. 
<br>
For free, as the web of old teached us. Without commercial crap, without advertising, without 
copyrights, without paying. Nothing, to nobody. Knowledge: sons of the light 
do actually beat black and blue all 
commercial minions and advertisers of the darkness. May they die tomorrow, pancaked by a 
truck, or something.

<br>
That is one of the reasons I have to use 
 a pseudonym instead of my real name. Indeed 
some of the searching techniques I will describe may be 
seen as <a href="hal2001/greenred7.gif">"non kosher"</a> 
in many of our euroamerican copyright-obsessed dictatorships.
    <br><br>
<font size=+2>Six steps?</font>
<br> 
0) combing & klebing: the structure of the web
<br>
1) Beyond google (and the problem with spammers)
 combing again, regional search engines: "buscadores hispanos"
<br>
2)  Nomen est omen
<br>
3) Guessing, stalking, social engineering  ---> database opening
<br>
   4) Playing with google (yo-yo; 5 words searching; images; long phrase:
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&as_qdr=all&q=%22%27who+is+that%3F%27+Frodo+asked%2C+when+he+got+a+chance+to+whisper+to+Mr.+Butterbur%22&btnG=Google+Search">"'who is that?' Frodo asked, when he got a chance to whisper to Mr. Butterbur"</a>)
<br>
5) Alternative techniques: Netcraft, Web of the past, minus ".com", minus "tits", 
compound searches, webferret/copernic/beeline/weblookup/hurricane/atomica(Gurunet)
<br>
6) Password wizardry: human beings are human, bob/bob etc. hardcoded passwords and lists

ANYTHING</td><td><font size=+1>Infact we will see together to-day, 
how to find ANYTHING on the web. <br>
Indeed the web is so huge  that -with almost no exceptions- searching in the correct way 
 will enable you to find 
anything you may be looking for. Any image, any music, any book, any document, any data, any 
software (proprietary or not), any newspaper... that has been published in the history of 
mankind. Whole national libreries, government archives, are going on 
line in this very moment in some god-forgotten 
country in Africa or Asia. 
<br>
    An incredible wealth of documentation for NGOs and grass-root organisations 
is available on line: Here an EU-related simple 
example:

Half a million people are putting in these very 5 seconds half a million 
scanned images on some god forgotten homepage. Another 350 thousand users 
are uploading, in THESE five 
seconds 350 thousand mp3, somewhere on the web.<br> 
Some of these books, of these images, of these musics, have never been on the web before. But they 
will now remain on Internet for the ETERNITY.
</td></tr>
<tr><td><font size=+1>
NO WAY BACK</td><td><font size=+1>Indeed, everything that has been published once, will remain 
on the web for ever and ever (and ever), in copycatted electrons, because the very moment something is 
there it will be copied. A simple demonstration of this is that you can find things that 
<a href="berlin.htm#disapp">DO NOT EXIST ANYMORE</a> on the web using one of the many repositories.
<br>
One of them is google cache, another one is the wayback machine, but there are many more, 
that will allow you to find data that have been 'pulled off' the web.
</td></tr>

<tr><td><font size=+1>
SOMEWHERE... WHERE?</td><td><font size=+1>Yep, all this stuff is on the web, somewhere, but where?<br>
You will have to use a lot of different techniques and approaches to search effectively the web. As 
you will see google, though worthy, is by FAR not the solution for your searches. In order 
to understand WHY you have to use different tools, you should first of all understand what the web 
looks like, from a searcher point of view. <br>
<a href="paris/theweb5.jpg">Structure</a><br><font color=blue>
Explain structure<br>
Explain diameter 19: do not dispair<br></font>
There is ONE important thing in this image that i wish you will not forget: the difference 
between INDEXED web (coupla milliard/billions sites) and NOT INDEXED web (9 milliard/billions pages more).
So when you are searching with the <a href="main.htm">main</a> search engines, with 
google, or with fast, or with wisenut, you are just <a href="hal2001/maincoverage2.jpg">limiting</a>  yourself to -in the best case- a FIFTH 
of the web.
<br>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><font size=+1>
SO, HOW DO YOU SEARCH?</td><td><font size=+1>Ok, how do you search your needles in this 
huge ocean of commercial hay?<br>
Let's begin with the beginning: usually you do not search a specific target: you search 
people that have searched that target. If the target has enough signal among the noise you 
may even search for people that have searched people that have searched for that specific 
target... :-)<br> This approach is called COMBING, and is rather effective. 
But before explaining it, we will have to understandhow the MAIN search engines really work, 
and WHY they are there. Simply stated, these "free" search engines exist in order to grep 
what you and million of other users are searching for.<br><font color=blue>
Anonymity -proxies- free homepages - free email addrsses -free search engines<br></font>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><font size=+1>
EXAMPLE ~ S.E. DIFFERENCES</td><td><font size=+1>
Let's take an example: 
you are interested ina  specific camera, how to use it, if it is worth using... whatever. 
Let's say a nikon F2<br>
Now, of course, you could search on google for nikon F2:<br>
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=%22nikon+f2%22&num=100&btnG=Google+Search&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&lr=&as_ft=i&as_filetype=&as_qdr=all&as_occt=any&as_dt=i&as_sitesearch=&safe=off">search?as_q=%22nikon+f2%22&num=100 :8180 results</a>
<br>
This is a good, simple query and it is what most people would do. And they may 
even be happy with it.<br>Nevertheless
a good idea would be to use ANOTHER main engine as well, let's say FAST:<br>
<a href="http://www.alltheweb.com/search?cat=web&lang=any&query=%22nikon+f2%22">&query=%22nikon+f2%22: 2561 results</a><br>
Before discussing this, it would not be bad to use at least a THIRD main search engine on such a broad query:<br>

<a href="http://www.wisenut.com/search/query.dll?q=%22nikon+f2%22">query.dll?q=%22nikon+f2%22: 6807 results</a>
<br>
A first thing to understand is that you should ALWAYS use at least two main search engines, 
when starting a broad 
query. As you may see if you follow the links above, wisenut, for instance, is more 'asian-centered' than 
google, which in our case, searching for a japanese camera, would probably be useful.
<br>
Now a normal user would be happy: Woah, 2000 - 6000 - 8000 results! I may browse for ever just here<br>
In fact first of all you CANNOT really see all those results. There is a difference between the 
number stated by teh search engines and the results you may really check yourself.<br>
If you really tryed to see ALL those links, you would quickly discover that<br>Here a table I made two months 
ago, based on another query, as you can see there is a huge difference between alleged results and 
results you can investigate:

</table>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><font size=+1>
WHILE WE ARE STILL AT THE MAIN SEARCH ENGINES</td><td><font size=+1>Some simple rules:<br>
1. always use more than one search engine! "<i>Google alone and you will never be done!</i>"
<br>2. Always use lowercase<br>
3. Always use MORE searchterms, not only one "<i>one-two-three-four, and if possible even more!</i>"<br>This is EXTREMELY important. 
Note that -lacking better ideas- even a simple REPETITION of the same term can give you more accurate results:<br>
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=nikon&num=100&btnG=Google+Search&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&lr=&as_ft=i&as_filetype=&as_qdr=all&as_occt=any&as_dt=i&as_sitesearch=&safe=off">nikon:  1,410,000 (alleged) results</a><br>
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&hl=en&as_qdr=all&q=nikon+nikon&btnG=Google+Search">nikon nikon: 627,000 (alleged) results</a><br>
If you are interested in this 'pleonastic' stuff, read <a href="epanalep.htm">The epanaleptical approach</a>.
<br><br>
Since we did not do it before, it's time to use more searchterms now. Here is a "better" query for our target (I will use google, but 
remember -yourself- to use also OTHER main searchengines when broadsearching, you will be amazed 
by the non overlapping results).<br>

<a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&hl=en&as_qdr=all&q=%22nikon+f2%22+nikkormat&btnG=Google+Search">&q=%22nikon+f2%22+nikkormat</a>
<br>
Interesting, eh?
<br>
Now look at this query:<br>
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&hl=en&as_qdr=all&q=%22links.html%23nikon%22&btnG=Google+Search">q=%22links.html%23nikon%22</a><br>
You may not recognize the querycodes above... it is just <font color=blue>"links.html#nikon"</font>. We are already slowly 
moving away from simple main search engines searching towards combing. In fact I was searching for pages of links that 
are of ineterest for my query. I can go further:<br>
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&as_qdr=all&q=%22nikon.htm%22+OR+%22nikon2.htm%22&btnG=Google+Search">"nikon.htm" OR "nikon2.htm"</a><br>
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&as_qdr=all&q=%22nikon%2A.htm%22&btnG=Google+Search">"nikon*.htm"</a><br>Another approach: 
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&as_qdr=all&q=%2Bnikon+nikkor+%2Bphoto+resources&btnG=Google+Search">+nikon nikkor +photo resources</a>
<br>As you see it's commercial infested... there is some need for our yo-yo here<br>
You get the idea.<br>
I could also use the netcraft trick: do we happen to have many "<a href="http://www.netcraft.com/?restriction=site+contains&host=nikon&lookup=Wait..&position=limited">nikonsites</a>"?<br>
Woha... 800 sites NAMES vontain the word nikon! (But many of them will be dormient).

</font>
</td></tr>

<tr><td><font size=+1>
BUT THE REAL DIFFERENCE</td><td><font size=+1>But the real difference between the simple 
queryes we have made above and a good seeker approach, is that above we are still just 
"skimming", or only slightly touching, the relatively 
small INDEXED part of the web. We are still missing 4/5ths of it! That's the reason you will have to learn at least some 
rudiments of combing.<br>
The first -simple- combing approach (remember: searching those that have already searched) is 
to use old glorious USENET!<br><font color=blue>
Usenet<br>
Messageboards<br>
Homepages<br>
Webrings<br>

the curious targets that people 
ask for at the end of my workshops, so do not ask me to find something specific for you now...<br>

<br>well it gets even stupider ... EVERY ---and i do mean EVERY <a target=_top href="http://www.altavista.com/web/results?q=applet%3Apassmaster&avkw=rf">passmaster login page</a> that I tested out, only needed but one little change in the URL and in IE the dowggone password log pops right up for viewing (in Netscape it works too but asks if you want to save it to disk)
<br>
<br>just remove whatever the blahblah.htm ending is in the url and type in its place 'password.log'
<br>and sure enuff pardner --- the log file jumps up showing all users passes and url's ... the thing is once you have the url for these dum things you don't even have to bother logging in with the user or pass... u just use the url that is listed
<br>
<br><a target=_top href="http://www.raphael-stoll.de/Password.htm">example:</a>
<br>
<br>now just change password.htm too password.log

Traditionally I conclude my workshops examining  ways to remove advertisement from 
this FANTASTIC Web-browser, that beats hands down any other browser on the market.<br>
You'll find a Linux version at <a href="http://www.opera.com/linux/">http://www.opera.com/linux/</a>, 
where you can either use the ad-infested version or purchase the non-ad one.<br>
Below I'll explain you how to eliminate advertisement in Opera 6.1 for windoze, but 
I would advice you to purchase, as I did, your own version, and help slick, good and fast 
Opera against the 
awful Netscapian and Microblowian browsersaurii.<br>
<br>
I do not believe that the following information will  damage Opera, on the contrary:<ul><li>
Only people able to reverse and unpack software (alas! a tiny minority in our zombified 
world) will be able to take advantage of that</li>
<li>zombies could ANYWAY, <i>inter alia</i> with the techniques described above, find <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&as_qdr=all&q=%22opera%22+name+serial+&btnG=Google+Search">a 
ready made cracked version</a> on the web</li>
<li>those among you that will reverse the source code in order to eliminate the ads, as 
described below, will learn how to use an hexeditor and an unpacker, and maybe even a 
good disassembler like Ida (the  free version of this incredibly powerful disassembler 
is <a href="zipped/idafree.zip">available for download</a> 
on my site). Hence they may grow into software reversers. Hence they will understand good, well written  
coded versus poorly coded -or right out dangerous- software. Hence they will hate overbloated 
and poor coded Microsoft and automagically
help <i>per fas et nefas</i> the FSF foundation, Opera and everyone else trying to break big software 
monopolies. 
</li>
<li>I sincerely believe that the good people at Opera should learn better <a href="protec/protec.htm">protections</a> for
their little juwel</li>
<li>Finally <a href="antiadve.htm">I hate advertisement</a>, and whenever I can give it a kick in the teeth, I do.</li></ol>
<br><br>

eliminating advertisement in Opera 6.1 Windoze
Code is now packed, use an unpacker first, else you wont see this:
