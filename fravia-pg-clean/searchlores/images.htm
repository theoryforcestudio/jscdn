Also: how to (try to) avoid copyright hassles when publishing</fonT>
     <br>(by fravia+)<BR><br></center><font size=+1>  
     The Web hosts billions (milliards) of images. How many is anybody's guess. Most seekers calculate that the 
     total number of images on the Web  has exceed 20 billions (milliards) during 2004. Should have been around 40 billions (milliards) in
     2007 and 80 billions right now (March 2009). These numbers must be taken <i>cum grano salis</i>, they are however on the 
     conservative side (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> alone, launched in 2004, has atm 4 billions images).<br> 
     Only about 10% of these images are indexed 
     by the <a href="images.htm#iengi">images searching  engines</a>. You may spend a long 
     time looking for the remaining 90%, and you are probably deemed to fail, unless you learn some 
     of the tricks explained <i>inter alia</i> on this very page.<br><br>I firmly believe that every picture, film, photo, sketch, drawing, 
     logo, mosaic... in short 
    <font color=blue>every image</font> that humanity 
     has ever concocted - from the noblest to the most perverse sense of this verb - is already  on the Web, somewhere, (so far 
     as it has been published in the last 50 years on any media that could have been digitized, duh).<br> 
     But do not take my word for it, try it out! Upload somewhere an image scanned by 
     yourself... let the web simmer for some months... shake well, and then search that very image <u>again</u> using the 
     techniques described below: 
     chances are you will find several copies of your image <u>elsewhere</u>.<br> 
     Should  -exceptionally- a given image still being amiss (<a href="longtermsearching.htm">after a thorough search</a>), do not worry: 
     it will eventually land on the web as well, sooner than you 
     may expect&nbsp;:-)
     <br><br>
     Put your hear to the searchscape and 
     be attentive... see? Whole pinacothecae (picture galleries) are going on line in this very moment: the complete 
     works of some barely known asian photograph, the Turner collection at Tate's,  a complete scanned comics collcection of the fifties, 
     the whole images 
     archive of -say- the Jornal do Algarve... you 
     name it, your eyes will have it.
     <br><br>
     Everything is there... but where? Where is <font color=blue>THE</font> image that you need now, and you mean now,  
     on the huge web?    Will you be able to find it effectively and quickly? Well, you will enjoy hearing that 
     the answer is: "Most probably".
     <br><br>
     There are various problems, though: <font color=blue>First of all</font> the amount of <font size="3" color="#0000FF">trash</font> 
     currently on the web is mind-boggling. 
     Most of it, how you may have already realized, is due to an extremely vulgar  paroxism of 'commercialisation'. 
     <br>Search for some specific artist's pictures, using the 
     <a href="main.htm">main</a> search engines, or their <a href="images.htm#iengi">specific image searching facilities collected on this page</a>, 
     and you will most probably be smothered in a squalid net of "reproduction" sellers. 
     <br><br>
     Their purpose is of course NOT 
     to reproduce on their sites in the best possible way the pictures you are looking for, their purpose is to sell you 
     some cheap reproduction and/or to have you pay for the 'right' to look at the picture you are interested in.<br><br>
    <div align="center"> <table border="1" width=77%><tr><td><div align="center"><font size="+2" color="#0000FF">A small digression: 
    images as they should be</font></div><br>
     There are some exceptions, though: for instance "<a href="http://earth.google.com/">googleearth</a>" (of all places) offers for 
     free some  incredibly detailed reproductions of (few: only 14) paintings from the 
     <a href="http://www.museodelprado.es/en/ingles/">Prado Museum</a>. These images have 
     a resolution <u>of 14,000 megapixels</u> (some 1,400 times greater than 
     a picture taken on a standard -good- 10 megapixel camera). You have to install "googleearth" first, 
     then go there to "layers", then geographic, then prado. You can of course then use Gimp to grab the details you are interested in.
     Worth seeing in order to understand how ridiculous are the attempts of those that want to "sell" reproductions and 
     how beautiful the web could be, if only the morons that manage our museums as if they were private property would for once do their job and 
     spread culture instead.<br> 
     These images were sewn together digitally from more than 8,000 high-resolution photographs of sections of the paintings.
     </td></tr></table></div>
     <br>Anyway in most cases your first hurdle will be to diminish or if possible completely eliminate 
     the commercial noise in order to get  a  cleaner signal of your target. Even 
     the simplest tricks (for instance 
     just adding <font color=blue>-".com"</font> to your 
     <a href="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=%22advanced+searching%22+-%22.com%22&num=10&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&btnG=Google+Search&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&lr=&as_ft=i&as_filetype=&as_qdr=all&as_occt=any&as_dt=i&as_sitesearch=&safe=images">searchstring</a>) 
     will go a long way to diminish the noise.   You may also want to 
     study more <a href="nemo_SEO.htm">complex 
     approaches</a> in your quest towards seekers' perfection.
   <br><br> 
   Also the huge amount of commercial <font color=blue>PORN</font> on the web can compel us to walk some tricky paths in order not to
          drown inside a quicksand of unwanted images (in fact  you'll have to 
          fend off  tons of unwanted commercial crap <a href="c_third.htm">even when looking purposely for a specific porn image</a>). You'll   
          soon realize that  
          the 'pornography' problem of the net is NOT AT ALL due to the real porn images collections 
          <i>per se</i>, but rather a consequence of a zillion of aggressive commercial sites 
          triyng to scrap some bucks - and polluting the whole web - using the most awful, vulgar and trite zombies' bites.
          <br><br>When searching for images  you will often have
           to deal with (read "enter") huge <font color=blue>databases</font> of images 
     which have been 
     puposedly '<a href="specdba.htm">hidden</a>', and that you (theoretically) should only access once given 
     permission by -say- a greedy commercial entity   
     or some malbehaving public museum, slowly sinking towards its own privatisation sunset.<br> In such cases some simple and well-known 
     <a href="password.htm">password bypassing</a> tricks can do wonders. 
<br><br>
Finally, note that images searching might be based on 

<ol>

	<li><font color =blue>images content</font> 
(e.g.: <a href="http://www.exalead.com/image/?nocookie=1&amp;js=1&amp;images_per_page=32">Exalead</a>, 
<a href="http://www.picitup.com/picitup/index.jsp">Pictitup</a> and 
<a href="http://images.google.com/">googleimages</a>)
</li>
	<li><font color =blue>images color</font> 
(e.g.: <a href="http://www.picitup.com/picitup/index.jsp">Pictitup</a>, 
<a href="http://www.picsearch.com/">picsearch</a>,
<a href="http://labs.ideeinc.com/multicolr/">multicolr search lab</a> 
and <a href="http://www.etsy.com/color.php">etsy</a>)</li>
	<li><font color =blue>images similarity</font> 
(e.g.: <a href="http://tineye.com/">tineye</a>)<br>
"<i>TinEye is a <u>reverse image search engine</u> indexing 
more than 1 billion (milliard)  images. You can submit your own image to TinEye to find out where it came from, 
how it is being used, if modified versions of the image exist, or to find higher resolution versions. 
TinEye is the first image search engine on the web to use image identification technology rather than keywords, 
metadata or watermarks</i>"</li>

Granted: the following could possibly provoke some raising of eyebrows among the most 
     <font color=blue>copyright conscious</font> corrupt politicians of ours. So you should better gain some basic knowledge of <a href="noanon.htm">anonymity lore</a> 
     and <a href="password.htm">password lore</a>, just in case.
    <br><br>
        Indeed -and specifically in case of images- a further (albeit silly) problem is the growing  
        "<font color=blue>copyright histeria</font>" pervading our american masters 
          and their local political lackeys. Suffice to say 
          that you still can (at least in the European Union) fetch, use, stomp, burn, modify, alterate ANY image published on Internet 
          provided that you respect some points:  <font color=blue>non 
          profit use</font> in the context of a 
          <font color=blue>creative work</font>, and of course  <font color=blue>giving due credit</font>. <br><br>You better harry up, though,  
          all legal screws are being tightened  
          in order to nail inside its coffin any  spark of knowledge and 
creativity that should still happen to survive 
          the "trendy" commercial perversion we have to endure.

<br><bR>
From a <u>theoretical</u> point of view, 
when citing Images and Pictures that you wish to use in your own 
papers or essays, you should cite the following elements: 
<ol><lI>
Artist's Name, if known 
</li><li>Copyright's holder, if known 
</li><li>Title of the image, if known (if not, use a description) 
</li><li>Institution where held, if known. 
</li><li>Title of article or book (if applicable) 
</li><li>Author of article or book (if applicable) 
</li><li>Title and Date of magazine (if applicable) 
</li><li>Database name (if applicable) 
</li><li>Date of access if online or publication if originally from print material 
URL (if applicable)</li></ol> 
Clearly some of these requisites, and especially the second, seem (and actually have been) devised in 
order to stiff creativity. 
<br>I know of a very <font color=blue>siple solution to such images' copyright 
hassles</font>: the following (this is all just theoretical academy, he, 
you will do this <u>only</u> if compatible with your local petty and heavily corporate lobbied anti-creativity laws). 
<br>
<br>Let's imagine (imagine)
that you badly need an image that might have a copyright owner somewhere (or might not... 
let's just say you tried to 
contact this "owner" but failed).<bR> In such a case let's imagine (imagine) that you: <ol><li> copy the image on your harddisk</li>
<li>  pass it with <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a>  
from jpg or png format to an uncompressed  format and then back to png 
with a different compression ratio</li><li> upload and publish it on any free page provider or blog somewhere on the web under a 
fake identity made through your cousin or devised on the fly in an internet cafe</li><li>  state clearly on this new site/blog that the 
image is free of any copyright and can be used 
by whomever for whatever purpose </li><li> cite "in good faith" this site/person when you publish it on your essay/book</li></ol>

Quod erat demonstrandum.

So, once again,   every image is "still and nevertheless" there... but where? Where is <font color=blue>THE</font> 
image that you need now, and you mean now,  
     on the huge web?   
     
   <br>Alas, the web -as we well know- is a <a href="nomomen.htm">web of WORDS</a>. Hence the way you prepare 
     your "search arrows", the way you formulate your <a href="rabbits.htm">search strings</a> or your <a href="bots.htm">search scripts</a> is of tantamount imporance in order 
     to find effectively (or even at all) the images you are seeking.<br>  
     Word and images are an INTEGRATED WHOLE! Hence <i>inter alia</i> the importance of the file formats 
      <a href="images.htm#format">discussed below</a>, which are 
     of course a part of the URL (web-address) of 
     your target.
        <br><br>
        As you may imagine, the problem onto a "web of words" is that most images gathering scripts and most search engines, 
        in order to identify image 
        files within the web, just examine the very "words" that happen to be in the title or in the proximity of a given image. 
        (Note however that google's  
        <font color=blue>&imgtype=face</font> parameter, <a href="images.htm#googlei">explained below</a>, is a first 
        step towards an interesting different approach). <br>The spiders look first at standard file extensions such as "jpg.", and just 
         integrate, additionally, <font color=blue>the image's  file name</font> and any eventual information they may be able to 
         gather <font color=blue>from the 
        path</font>. Bingo! That's all, thankyou very much.<br> Unfortunately, file names and path names are 
        often very cryptic, frequently abbreviated, 
        and they  - more often than 
        not - hardly  
        describe the visual content of the image.   <br>Hence if, say, a white rabbit has 
        been named  "<font color=blue>snowflake</font>", you 
        may find that your results will be littered with 
        a bunch of <a target=_top href="http://www.thebunnybunch.org/graphics/snowball%20&%20snowflake.jpg">pictures</a> 
        of someone's favourite pet. 
        <br><br>
        Even worse than cryptic names are -for seekers- those 'generic' image names, for instance 
        <a target=_top href="http://images.google.com/images?um=1&tab=wi&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&lr=&oe=UTF-8&q=image1.jpg&safe=off">image1.jpg</a>,  
        <a target=_top href="http://images.google.com/images?svnum=10&um=1&hl=en&lr=&safe=off&q=home.jpg&btnG=Search+Images">home.jpg</a> and 
        <a target=_top href="http://images.google.com/images?svnum=10&hl=en&safe=off&q=logo.gif&btnG=Search+Images">logo.gif</a>:   
         field examples of web-triteness. <font color=blue>In our society thou 
        shalt never underestimate thyne neighbour induced propensity for utter banality</fonT>.

<table border=1 width=100% CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0>
<tr><td bgcolor="#C6E7C6"><center>Where to search for images</center></td></tr></table><br> 
An image or picture query is  usually started using the general <a href="images.htm#iengi">images searching  engines</a> facilities, offered 
by <a href="main.htm">main</a> search engines like Google or Altavista. It is also useful to perform searches on  
 specialised <a href="images.htm#itools">Images 
searching tools</a>, that
 index only images or multimedia.<bR><a href="images.htm#itools">Images public repositores</a> à la flickr might offer also some results, 
 ditto for <a href="local.htm#reposi">file repositories</a> à la rapidshare.
 <br>
In addition, there are also <a target=_top href="http://www.faganfinder.com/img/">images metasearch engines</a>, which pass 
on search requests to more than one search engine and then bring back the results. (For such engines you should head the same 
caveats valable for all <a href="compound.htm">compound and metasearch</a> engines: <a href="Luxembourg_2006.htm#recallprecision">slightly better recall, but 
general slowness and lack of precision</a>).
<br>
Searching through <a href="blog.htm">blogs</a>, and of course on <a href="usenet.htm">usenet</a> can also give excellent images results.
<br><br>
The usual <a href="combing.htm">combing</a> and <a href="local.htm">local</a> searching techniques used for general searching of course
apply to images searching as well.
<br><br>
          But before even beginning, you might wish to get acquinted with the different and most common image formats.

<br>

Some info about the MAIN formats used on the
web for images: JPG, GIF and PNG can be useful for images seekers.<br>
While GIF  and PNG are great for computer generated images with limited
palettes, PNG and JPG are far better for photographs, because  
 give better quality images for the same
file size. PNG should always be used, whenever possible, because of its <font color= blue>patent-free compression algorithm</font>.          
<br><br>
<font color=blue>GIF</font> (Graphics Interchange Format) is a data stream-oriented file format 
used to define the transmission
protocol of LZW-encoded bitmap data. GIF images may be up to eight bits
(256 colors) in depth and are always compressed. Despite the fact that GIF
supports only 8-bits worth of colors, and the multimedia extensions
introduced in the 89a release have not been widely utilized, GIF still

<font color=blue>JPG</font> (in dos systems) and <font color=blue>JPEG</font>  (mostly in non-dos systems)
<br>(JPEG-JFIF "Joint Photographic Experts Group" - "Jpeg File Interchange Format")<br> 
 is optimized for photographs and similar continuous tone
images that contain many, many colors. GIF compression is unkind
to such images. JPG works by analyzing images and discarding kinds
of information that the eye is least likely to notice.  The JPEG format stores
information with 8-bit per color - red, green and blue for a total of 24-bits.
<br> The degree of compression is
adjustable. At small compression levels of photographic images, it
is very difficult for the eye to discern any difference from the
original, even at extreme magnification. Compression factors of
more than 20 are often quite acceptable. Better (free) graphics programs,
such as <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">Gimp</a> or Paint Shop Pro, allow you to view the image quality and
file size as a function of compression level, so that you can
conveniently choose the balance between quality and file size.
<u>Note that JPG/JPEG files  suffer generational degradation when repeatedly edited and saved</u>.

<bR><hr width=44% align=left>

Currently, GIF and JPG are still the formats used for most web
images. <br>However, <font color=blue>PNG</font> (Portable Network Graphics)
does everything GIF does, and better, being not limited to 256 colors, so 
many expect 
PNG,  created as the free and open-source successor to the GIF file format,  to replace
GIF. <br>

You should always use PNG instead of JPG for your own images and pictures because of the following advantages: 

Lossless compression,
48-bit, true-color depth, 
varying levels of transparency, 
gamma correction, 
better compression (10-30 percent smaller files than GIF), 
searchable content, 
<font color= blue>patent-free compression algorithm</font>.<br>

The PNG file format supports true color (16 million colors). PNG excels when the image has large areas of uniform color.<br>
<br>The advantage of PNG on JPG/JPEG is that
saving, restoring and re-saving a PNG image <u>will not degrade its quality</u>. PNG does not support animation like GIF does, though.
<bR>

The PNG format provides a portable, legally unencumbered, well-compressed,
  well-specified standard for lossless bitmapped image files.  Although the
  initial motivation for developing PNG was to replace GIF, the design
  provides also some useful new features not available in GIF, like opacity (PNG allows the control of the degree of transparency).

<bR><hr width=44% align=left>
                  Another, for seekers less important format, used mostly for archives and desktop publishing, 
                  is the  <font color=blue>TIFF</font> format (Tagged Information File Format, aka Tagged Image File Format aka... 
                  See <a target=_top href="http://home.earthlink.net/~ritter/tiff/">http://home.earthlink.net/~ritter/tiff/</a>). 
                  <bR>It is a flexible image format that supports either 16-bit per color - red, green and blue for a total of 48-bits - 
                  or 8-bit per color - red, green and blue for a total of 24-bits - and uses a filename extension of TIFF or TIF.

<center> June 2007: <a href="http://images.google.com/images?num=20&hl=en&safe=off&q=snowflakes&spell=1">77200</a> 
 results.<bR><br>

     <font size=+2>Google's  <a target=_top href="http://images.google.com/advanced_image_search?hl=en1">ADVANCED Images</a> search</font> 
         <br> <br></center>
         You can use the <a target=_top href="http://images.google.com/advanced_image_search?hl=en1">advanced</a> image search page 
to specify 
a series of <u><b>parameters</b></u><br>Alternatively you can add on your own to the URL the relevant stringsnippets listed below: 
per hand or per <a href="bots.htm">bot</a>.<br>
Google is now the ideal images search engine <u>to search for faces</u>, duh.
<br><ul><li>The <u><b>size</b></u> of the image you want (<font color=blue>&imgsz=</font>: any size, <font color=blue>&imgsz=xxlarge</font>: large, 
<font color=blue>&imgsz=small</font>: medium, 
<font color=blue>&imgsz=icon</font>: small).
<br>
There's evidently some confusion in google switches: medium images can be obtained  with 
a rather counter-intuitive <font color=blue>&imgsz=small</font> or also with anyone or everyone of  the following parameters:<br> 
<font color=blue>&imgsz=small|medium|large|xlarge</font> &nbsp; or alternatively: &nbsp;  <font color=blue>&imgsz=small%7Cmedium%7Clarge%7Cxlarge</font>
<br><br></li><li>
The image 
<u><b><a href="images.htm#format">format</a></b></u>  (<font color=blue>&as_filetype=gif</font>: .gif, <font color=blue>&as_filetype=png</font>: .png or <font color=blue>&as_filetype=jpg</font>: .jpg).
<br><br>
</li><li>
The <u><b>color</b></u> choice: you may  want "any colors" or only want 
<font color=blue>&imgc=mono</font>: "black and white", <font color=blue>&imgc=gray</font>: "grayscale", or <font color=blue>&imgc=color</font>: "full colour" images.
<br><br></li><li>
There are also three <u><b>censorship filters</b></u> options: <font color=blue>&safe=off</font>: no filtering;
<font color=blue>&safe=images</font>: "moderate" filtering;
<font color=blue>&safe=active</font>: "strict" censored filtering;
     <br>
<br></li>
<li>
A further interesting parameter is <font color=blue>&imgtype</font> 
<br><font color=blue>&imgtype=face</font>: "only faces". This must be a consequence of that "neven vision" face recognition software, bought 
by Google.<br>Compare <a href="http://images.google.com/images?as_q=%22betty+page%22&hl=en&output=images&svnum=10&btnG=Google+Search&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&imgsz=&as_filetype=&imgc=&as_sitesearch=&safe=off">Betty 
page</a> and <a href="http://images.google.com/images?as_q=%22betty+page%22&hl=en&output=images&svnum=10&btnG=Google+Search&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&imgsz=&as_filetype=&imgc=&as_sitesearch=&safe=off&imgtype=face">Betty page with &imgtype=face</a>
<br>
Further we have  <font color=blue>&imgtype=news</font>: "only images from the news". This could even be useful in some (rare) cases.
<br>
Clearly the idea is soon or later to be able to detect and recognize obects and/or persons inside any picture.

It seems that altavista image search and fast image search 
are searching the same database (yahoo bought altavista, fast 
and inktomi). Probably altavista have slightly broader 'SERPs' 
because it also searchs other sources: corbis, news and 
rollingstone. 
<br>
<br>Altavista image search has some interesting filters: you can filter out images that have the shape of Buttons or Banners (i.e. the ratio length/width is very different from 1). Altavista has also a filter to search graphics which is not too shabby, I think the algorithm consists in giving images whith a small color pallet.
<br>
<br>Surprisingly (or maybe not:) altavista image search and fast image search share the same sintax, that is if you want to search for cat or dog you must type: (cat dog). 
<br>
<br>Altavista provides more images per pages and given what I said is a better choice than fast...
<br>
<br>Altavista image search provides, for each image, a link with more info. There you'll find the text that was used to <u>classify the image</u> and the url of the image's page (some servers are configurated to show the images only if the correct reffering page is provided... that's a *big* problem with fast because it doesn't show the page's url).  Basically the text used to classify the images are:<ul>
<li>a snippet of text before or after the image
<li>the anchor text on any link pointing to the image
<li>the alt text of the image
<li>the image's url</ul>

The match of keywords on the images 
name is a little more broader: a image named 
'acat.jpg' will also match the keyword 'cat', the same is true for Google.
<br>
<br>Google's algorithm is 
basically the same  you still could see when 
Google was showing carelessly the image's cache... 
You can still see that Google is using the 
same strategy, but now you must work a little more 
to deduce it&#33;
<br>
<br>BTW this kind of algorithm has 
naturally implemented a proximity 
operator for the keywords *because* the snippets of text are usually quite 
small.

Image: snowflake, domain:edu</fonT><bR> by fravia+
<br><br>
Contrary to the old wisdoms and  promises of the ancients,
 the old trick of gong for quality limiting a search for images to the "edu" domains (as
some obsolete 
search guides still 
underline), DOES NOT WORK ANYMORE, alas!
<br>
Please note the differences, both in quantity and in quality of the retrieved images:
<br>
This is <font color=blue>google images search</font> for snowflake:
<a target=_top href="http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&lr=&ie=ISO-8859-1&safe=off&q=snowflake&btnG=Google+Search">&q=snowflake</a> (18900 good results)<bR>
Whereas...<br>this is google image search for snowflake limited to "edu" domains:
<a target=_top href="http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&lr=&ie=ISO-8859-1&safe=off&q=snowflake+site%3Aedu&btnG=Google+Search">&q=snowflake+site%3Aedu</a> (688 bad results)
<bR>
<br><br>
Samo samo with <font color=blue>Fast/Alltheweb images search</font>:
<bR>
everything: <a target=_top href="http://www.alltheweb.com/search?cs=utf-8&dincl=edu&cat=img&q=snowflake&avkw=fogg">q=snowflake</a> (13399 good results)
<br>versus<br>
only edu: <a target=_top href="http://www.alltheweb.com/search?avkw=fogg&cat=img&cs=utf-8&q=snowflake+site%3Aedu">&q=snowflake+site%3Aedu</a> (401 bad results)

<br><br>


The reason is that the very moment you specify a "Zusatz" to your query, 
the special algos that 
(try to) protect you from those snowflakes that are not snowflakish at all will 
disappear, just like a snowflake im hell. Hence  
you will be served with all "edu" results, indipendently from their  non-pertinence to 
the original image query. <br>Alas, these results will be 
indipendent from their own crappiness as well: edu sites 
are not exclusive repositories of "a more scholarly context": 
on most "edu" domains (universities, colleges etcetera)  students have PERSONAL 
PAGES (usually 
in some edu subdirectory beginning with a ~ tilde) where they gladly publish "le tout et n'importe quoi".
<br><br>
So if you want to "go for quality" you should rather change your arrows!
Using for instance "snowcrystals" instead of "snowflakes" or trying 
some 'regional arrows' will give you rather different images.<br>
<bR>Try for instance the following: 
<a target=_top href="http://www.alltheweb.com/search?avkw=fogg&cat=img&cs=utf-8&q=schneeflocke&_sb_lang=pref">&q=schneeflocke</a>: note how google's help filters do not 
work for german, so you fish mucho noise among your signal, and note the difference between the previous search on US-google and the following "deutsche" search: 
<a target=_top href="http://images.google.de/images?hl=de&ie=ISO-8859-1&q=schneeflocke&sa=N&tab=wi&meta=lr%3Dlang_de">schneeflocke</a>.
<bR><br>
Of course you can and should also try many more <a href="regional.htm">regional</a> searches: <a target=_top href="http://images.google.fr/images?hl=fr&lr=lang_fr&ie=ISO-8859-1&q=flocon&btnG=Recherche+Google">&q=flocon</a>.

Turning a distraction in a search tecnique</font><br>
by altosax<br><br>

I was reading an interesting post on a newsgroup when i decided to
search that argument on Google. I already had the Google page open so
simply typed the words "shear modulus" and clicked the button.
Well, what i had were only images. The fact was that the opened page was
not www.google.com but images.google.com (that i also use). But this
event gave me the idea <b><u>to use the images search for everything else</u></b>.
<br><br>
What i noticed infact was that <font color=blue>a lot of sites were relevant for my
search and for related arguments</font>. This happens because when the words are
searched in the pages content the hits returned also contain a lot of
trash pages but how many pages display an image which name is related to
your search?<br><br>
This kind of search has a great advantage too, because you can visually
choose which link to follow, because Google shows you the images that matched
your search.
<br><br>
To better understand the point, try yourself my search <ol><li>on <font color=blue>images_google</font>:
<a target=_top href="http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&lr=&ie=ISO-8859-1&q=shear+modulus&safe=off&
btnG=Google+Search">shear modulus</a></li><li> and on good ole <font color=blue>sites google</font>: <a target=_top href="http://www.google.com/search?q=shear+modulus&svnum=10&hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&safe=off&sa=N&tab=iw">shear modulus</a>... 
</li></ol>
Have you got the point?

The design I finally decided to go with for image comparison was based on the 
frequency of colours in certain regions of the source and target images. 
I have chosen this design as a compromise for speed and experimentation. 
There are many variables to tweak, some values giving you good results and 
others terrible, but I wanted to build in flexibility so we can experiment 
and discover what works well for the sources and targets we have in mind.

Honestly , i have read everything fravia+ and company wrote on this but i still don't really understand which techniques you are supposed to use example , i recall a cherished image seen many many years ago somewhere i don't remember , i don't remember the name either , i don't know the artist , how  do i proceed to find it????

<b>Re: How do you search for images?</b>&nbsp;<font size=-2>(26/04/01 18.20.28)</font>
<ul>
I've played around with image searching a lil bit and still have much to do to put any cohesion to any pattern that might work
<br>in your case you do not have any filename; nor, byte size, pixel size, or any alt statement to try to follow
<br>
<br>you must sit down and write up a list of everything you recall about the picture... you must repaint it with descriptive words (this does not mean you are going to find it; this is just how i would suggest you 'proceed to [try to] find it'
<br>
<br>what is the picture you remember? what is in the picture you remember?
<br>
<br>Build the picture with 'words'
<br>
<br>example: A picture of children jumping rope
<br>are they on school grounds? at home? in a meadow? whats going ON in the picture?
<br>
<br>some keywords might be: children kids jumping rope {children} playing school recess 
<br>you must be careful which keywords you use in an engine such as googgle
<br>if you put children and kids in the same line and it does not FIND BOTH of those words on some exisiting web page then  IT will NOT give you a return/ or it might find 10 hits with children and kids
<br>but find 1000 for chilren [without kids]
<br>or find 300 for kids  [without children]
<br>When you have a GOOD idea of what you want to look for the less HITS is always better for sifting and narrowing down... but in your case the more hits the better because you do not know what you are looking for...why do i think it is better? well because by looking at the returns i skim and see if I can garner some better more meaningful list of words that connect to [children playground school jumping rope ect ect ect]
<br>what kind of dress style were these children in in the painting i remember?
<br>ohhhhhh very old time/ not modern/
<br>are they jumping rope on pavement? brick? dirt? gravel? these can be indicative of time periods also... ect
<br>
<br>How old could the painting be? go look up the history of rope jumping...[Im going to just make this up cause i don't have time to search it out] but lets say u search it and it comes back saying--- and the first instance of childreen jumping rope was because of this or that event and occurred in this or that country in 1734
<br>ok well now we know that unless your painter was orson wells who could conjure up children skipping rope that did not exist yet--that he was probably born after 1734...probably didn't start his starving artist carrer until he was 20 so probably an artist after 1754 plus+ or minus ... 300 years of artists doesn't narrow it down for you much...but you see where i am heading? at least you eliminated all paintings before 1734 :) Now what artists specialized in paintings of kids? [perhaps so; perhaps not--- don't get stuck on thinking he specialized (OR SHE&#33;)] add art/artist/paintings of to word list...kindasorta...
<br>its hard to say because adding just ONE too many [as well as an incorrect one] words can completely change your return/s...
<br>whats in the background? forest rivers lakes mountains --- European? American?
<br>
<br>anyway i could go on and on ... the idea here is to BUILD a word list that describes your quarry
<br>
<br>this probably will explain it better:

<b>Re: Re: How do you search for images?</b>&nbsp;<font size=-2>(27/04/01 09.33.29)</font>
<ul>
.oh well. some pointers here.
<br>
<br> I guess there are some questions you should ask yourself BEFORE beginning your searching task.
<br>
<br>1) Was that picture of a famous artist ? (whether or not you recall his name) like a painting or something alike ?
<br>2) Was it found in a site dealing with that sort of pictures (whether or not you can remember the url) or a commercial site?
<br>3)Was it of high quality ? (meaning over 200-300kbytes) or a small one? ..-100kb?
<br>
<br>I guess that if your answer to all above questions is something like:
<br>1) No
<br>2)No
<br>3)Small
<br>
<br> I'm sorry to say that you probably have NO chance of finding it (except if you are tooooooo lucky:).
<br>
<br>I dont have the time right now to explain why the above pointers (plus some others) are of great importance (but i will in a short kind of essay in the near future) but i've been dealing with the "how to find pictures" task a long time now.
<br>
<br> p.s Rainbows tactic is VERY CORRECT (grammatical anomaly here eheh) but, i think he will agree, that tactic will give you more possibilities into finding your picture if the answer on the above three questions is affirmative. His suggestions is THE way to navigate throught your results (after you have had a succesful query with small noise analogy that is) into extracting the picture you want (sort of like evaluating your results - results that you KNOW one of them should include your target).
<br>
<br> This post might seem a little fuzzy, but im on a deadline here eheh. I guess my pointers helped you a bit.
<br>
<br>I'll see you all later :)

Just some comments about the previous search: some things valuable out of the pure 
'technical' stuff. 
<br><br>
once the image has a context, it's always easier to fish it out of the web, 
mostly because the image search engine index the pictures using the information 
they can gather on their pages (the 'physical' context). 
<br><br>
usually, if you have only the picture, you need to build that context : 
making list of identified objects on the picture, colours, positions, 
subject, impressions etc.. There are plenty of methods to read and 
describe images. I'll try to find a good ressource. 
<br><br>
Combined with the other concrete informations (size, format, filename..) 
you can think about a method, and forge your queries. 
<br><br>
BUT, if the image is provided within a context, you can take some shortcuts. 
In the case of the emperor's clothes, once the connection with Andersen was 
made, most of the problem is solved. It's often the case with riddles, 
every detail count :) 
<br><br>
I'm sure we could write/find/compile methods to read/describe/find images. 
But some may prefer the chaotic way. Thoughts ? 
<br><br>
~ 
<br><br>
Another comment : we should take a closer look to amazon. 
it has more and more interesting features. the scanned pages 
of books are one, jeff and vvf found some audio oriented tricks, 
and recently they began to provide a 'full text search' for books..

I was searching for ressources dealing with image description and analysis when i found some interesting ressources for the image searching section. A good addition would be to add a 'image databases' subsection, next to general search engines. Some of these databases may have a SE too.
<br>
<br><a target=_top href="http://www.istl.org/istl/01-summer/internet.html">What You See Is What You Get: Science Images on the Web</a>
<br><i>A selection of image-rich web sites in a variety of scientific disciplines is offered as a starting point for 
reference questions and educational programs. Tools for keeping up with new image resources are introduced. This review 
does not cover searching general World Wide Web sites or general commercial image databases for science images.</i>
<br>
<br>Already reviewed, and classified ;)
<br>
<br>For evaluation purpose, here is the path i walked :
<br>
<br>Simple combing :) Gerverau is the author of a book i have, but in french, dealing with description and analysis 
of images. He is president of the International Association of Museums of History, curator of the Museum of 
Contemporary History (Paris) and director of the Cinema Museum (Paris). He wrote some scientific books on the 
subject of images and is the owner of <a href="http:/www.imagesmag.net">imagesmag.net</a>, a website dealing with research about image. So, my 
opinion was that he is a sort of authority in that domain :
<br>
<br>Searching on google : gervereau analysis images
<br>
<br>hit n°8 : http://web.usal.es/~alar/Bibweb/Materias/I/imagenes.htm
<br>

<br>A commented bookmark, wich contains the WYSIWYG:SI ressources.
<br>
<br>That's it. I'll see if there are others gems in these, i'm still searching for good method of image analysis :)
<br>
<br>-----
<br>
<br>On a side note, still about images, i heard this morning in my 'IT and sociology' (i don't know how to name it) course about GETTY IMAGES and CORBIS.
<br>You (I) must have a look at what those company are in..
