<font size=+2>How to remove those ugly and vulgar advertisement banners</font>

<hr width=44%>There are more than THREE HUNDRED MILLIARDS sites 
out there, doubling every EIGHT months... and many 
among them do carry absolutely useless banners 
and ads that sore our eyes. Of course most readers of 
this site are using <font color=blue>[</font><a href="proxies.htm">proxies</a><font color=blue>]</font> 
and good browsers, 
like <font color=blue>[</font><a href="tuttiope.htm">Opera</a><font color=blue>]</font> 
 or Firefox, able to   
nuke  
all crap-images "on the fly". Thus our savvy readers can access quickly enough the contents they 
are searching for... <i>rari nantes in gurgite vasto</i>.<hr>

BFilter is a filtering web proxy. It was originally intended for removing banner ads only, 
but since then its capabilities have been greatly extended. Unlike most of the similar tools, it doesn't 
rely on blacklists (although it does support them). The problem with blacklists is 
that advertisers are always one step ahead. You see an ad slip through, you 
update your blacklist, and in case it didn't help, you add a new entry yourself. Once its Author got tired of that, he decided to write a proxy 
that would detect ads heuristically, much like modern anti-virus software manages to detect many viruses unknown to it.

The advertisers clowns and lackeys argue that "Netizens enter into an implicit agreement with Web 
companies to accept
their ads in exchange for free information", similar to television viewers forced to slurp 
commercials
in exchange for free programming. But there are no explicit agreements, and many users want to
rid their surfing experiences of large banner ads that can take minutes to load, so, let's proceed, despite what whomever may argue&nbsp;:-)
<bR><br>
First of all we should -IMO- find the EARLY copies of some interesting software solutions: as you'll see below, 
most of them have been -alas- subsequently censured or volontarly crippled :-(
<hr width=44%>
James Howard, created Internet Fast Forward, one of the first programs designed to filter out banner ads. 
<br><bR>
The software he produced was discontinued due to liability problems after he sold his company, PrivNet, to Pretty Good Privacy in November 1996. Howard said Internet companies had threatened to sue, accusing his company of violating their copyrights and modifying their pages. Howard had countered that users were the ones who controlled the content, not the software producers. 
<br><br>
PGP decided the risk of lawsuits was too great and <font color=blue>stopped production of the ad filtering program</fonT>. 
<br><br>


<hr width=44%>
Solid Oak, the Internet filtering company that produces the Web filtering software Cybersitter, introduced tools to screen out banner ads. 
<bR><br>
Brian Milburn, president of Solid Oak, said he introduced the filtering technology in response to requests from some of Cybersitter's 1.2 million customers, many of whom use older computers with slow Internet connections that make viewing banner ads a time-intensive task. 
<br><br>
<u>One day later</u> the company <font color=blue>rescinded the tool that screens out ads in free email services</fonT>, because users sign contracts saying they will accept ads in exchange for free email, Milburn said. 
<br><br>

+Greythorne wrote (long ago) a bautiful javascript banner killer, that 
you'll find <a href="bkiller.txt">here</a>. Here is what Wizard +Greythorne writes about it:
"<font color=blue>Note: this proggy uses popup windows to capture popup windows

On many free host, you have a banner added automaticaly on index.html.
If your user has JavaScript enabled, here his a trick, insert 


&lt;script language="Javascript">

&lt;!--

location.href="main.htm"

//-->

&lt;/script>


between header and body.
It will be read before everything and the user even 
doesn't see (s)he has changed of page.

Hi, I somehow managed to remove the popups for virtual 
avenue by adding this codes before the
&lt;html&gt; of every page.

//to avoid Javascript error notice
&lt;script&gt;
function NoError() {
return(true);
} 
onerror=NoError; 
&lt;/script&gt;

//to prevent the pop-up
&lt;script&gt; 
va_rvjr137y=window.open; 
function OpenNullWin() {
this.window;
} 
function FakeOpen(url,nam,atr) {
return(new OpenNullWin());
} 
window.open=FakeOpen;
&lt;/script&gt;


Looking at the codes added by the server, va_rvjr137y 
seems to be the "window handle". By modifying the codes 
produced by Proxomitron, I was able to add this codes in 
to counter the popups. Just tested without the codes, the 
popup is seen. When I add in the codes, the pop-up disappeared.


For Xoom website, they will automatically add in an extra frame. To counter 
that, add in _XOOM into your links eg
http://members.xoom.com/Ryanosis/files.html
into
http://members.xoom.com/_XOOM/Ryanosis/files.html

But in this case, you will need a website director.

Another way is to add the codes
&lt;script language="JavaScript"&gt;

&lt;!--
if (top.location.href != location.href)
top.location.href = location.href;
// --&gt;

&lt;/script&gt;

On services that stick their banner code at the very end of 
your page, the simplest way to
eliminate the popups is to stick a "NOEMBED" tag after your 
closing "/HTML". This works fine for
me in Opera 3.60 and all versions of Netscape and MSIE tested. 
I figure why use javascript
against itself when you can use html against javascript and be 
more compatible (or is it
incompatible?) with more banners.<br>

Gordon</font>

<hr>
On
remobann.htm, Gordon mentioned using a &lt;noembed> tag after
the &lt;/html> tag for hosts that put their disease (code) at
the end of your pages. Though, he said this was supported by
all browsers he tested, I found that it did not work in NS
Communicator 4.72 (multiple tests). Of course, it may have
only been a glitch. I decided to try adding a &lt;noscript> tag
after the prescribed &lt;noembed> (since they 'so cleverly' add
closing tags in front of their precious crap code in the
event you leave a &lt;script> or &lt;noscript> tag open
--accidentally, of course :] ) and it did the trick in Opera
4.02, NS Communicator 4.72, and M$IE 5.0. Oh, yeah... this
was on a Geocities account... foolish me! Best wishes to you
and the new searching fortress!<br>
