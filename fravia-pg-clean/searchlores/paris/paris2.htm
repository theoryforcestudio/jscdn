<hr>


Since the invention of the "Altavista-type" of indexing texts, search techniques 
became COMPLETELY different than before. As you probably already know, there are 
many "main" search engines. In this workshop I'll limit my (relative) "depth" 
covering to Altavista, but there are many other main engines that use the same 
approach, like Alltheweb/Fast, for instance, a search engine that recently claimed 
to have the 
maximum 'coverage' of the web, whatever that is supposed to mean coming from 
people that did index whole databases of millions of -say- "galactic images" just to be 
the first to pass the 'one milliard' target in their race with Google...
<br><br>
But indexing à-la Altavista they do, indeed. You must understand correctly what this kind 
of word for word indexing meaned (and still means).<br> 
The COMPLETE text of hundred of millions of pages, "y compris" the positions of commas, has been indexed. This means that if you input in -say- Alltheweb/fast  the relatively long phrase
<a href=" http://www.alltheweb.com/cgi-bin/asearch?type=all&query=%22These+are+pages+that+the+Nucleus+points+to%2C+and+that+may+%28or+may+not%29+point+back+to+the+Nucleus.%22 ">These are pages that the Nucleus points to, and that may (or may not) point back to the Nucleus."</a> 
you'll find immediately the page where I began speaking about such matters 
(it was during a workshop in Milan last October)... and, even more interesting, 
 using the same search, you'll soon find the minutes of this very workshop of mine, 
 here in Paris to-day, PROVIDED they will be published with EXACTLY the same 
 sequence of terms.<bR><br>
As you can and will see, the longer and more exact the phrase you have given as input, 
the more precise will be the 'magic' that will pull out of the dark huge hat containing 
millions of indexed sites exactly the page you wanted. As you can imagine this makes it on 
the one hand extremely easy to search for copycatted texts ('plagiarisms') 
around the web. At the same time, on the other hand, knowing how to search 
effectively could easily allow anyone of you to find an almost 
ready-made text to -ahem- "solve brilliantly" whatever assignment you are bound to do 
for tomorrow. So even 
plagiarism -as everything in life- may have two faces, eh&nbsp;:-)<br>
<br>
The (brilliant) idea behind Altavista was to create a full-text search 
of the entire internet. This was an incredible step. The main search engines todays
are Google (with Topclick), Fast/alltheweb, Altavista (with Raging) and Hotbot. 
<br>Google went even further: they have made a <SPAN STYLE="color: black; background: yellow">cached copy</span> 
of every page they have indexed. You can imagine how important this can be when a page 
you'r stalking did disappear or was pulled down.<br><br>
This said, if I were you, I wouldn't limit myself to one or just to a few 
engines: Northernlight with its folders and webtop with its new algos are for 
instance very useful TOOLS, that you'll 
have to use during some delicate queries...
<br><br>Let's have a quick look at the <i>sancta sanctorum</i> of a search engine. 
For any search engine, <i>ergo</i> for <B style="color:black;background-color:#ffff66">Altavista</B> as well, it is critically important to assign location values 
properly when indexing sites. Inside Altavista the assigning of
locations is fully automatic in the simplest case... where a function called 
<SPAN STYLE="color: black; background: yellow"><a href="https://searchlores.nickifaulk.com/paris/addwo.htm">avs_addword</a></span> does all the work.<br> In this
case the words of the document are laid out end to end and are numbered sequentially starting
with the value returned by other functions (avs_newdoc or avs_startdoc). 
The same is true for field boundaries
and for values (indexed quantities like dates that can be range-searched).
The following diagram shows how two very short documents would be stored inside altavista's 
index
database.<br><br><center>
<table border=1>
<tr><td></td><td colspan=6 bgcolor="#C6E7C6"><center>document 1</center></td><td colspan=7 bgcolor="#C6E7C6"><center>document 2</center></td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="#C6E7C6">word</td><td>here</td><td>you</td><td>have</td><td>a</td><td>short</td><td>page</td><td>Thisnotwithstanding<br>thisnotwithstanding</td><td>here</td><td>you</td><td>have</td><td>another</td><td>short</td><td>page</td></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor="#C6E7C6">location</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>8</td><td>9</td><td>10</td><td>11</td><td>12</td><td>13</td></tr>

</table></center><br>
As the figure illustrates, each word is actually stored as a word-location pair. The index also
contains information about the starting and ending locations of each document. Document1
starts at location 1, and Document2 starts at location 7.
In Document2, the first word contains an uppercase letter, so the word is indexed twice: once
with case preserved and once in all lowercase. Both versions of the word are at the same
location, so that the word would be found appropriately regardless of whether a query is case
sensitive or case-insensitive.<br><br>
The words are added sequentially,  the actual update to the index is made, using
avs_makestable every so many documents, 
or when the last
document of a linked bunch has been processed.<br><br>
Thus Altavista keeps separate indexes both for case-insensitive and case-sensitive queries, to allow both types. Thus a search for Paris would give you at the moment more or less 3,310,210 pages as "Paris" but more or less 3,598,040 pages as "paris", which covers all possible uppercase/lowercase occurrences. And yes, before you ask: a search for "PAris" would give you "quand même" more or less 614 pages... 'mistakes' searches are btw at times quite useful for stalking purposes... but that is another story.
<br><br>
Why did I say "more or less"? Because the same searches on Altavista will give you DIFFERENT results depending on 
a series of  parameters: which of the many altavista servers you have locked into, 
<SPAN STYLE="color: black; background: yellow">the time of the day</span> (when the united states' populace is awake  and cheerfully 
browsing, everything is slower on all backbones and the servers of the main search 
engines prefer to 'cut' the number of reported answers quite brutally to anyone 
querying). Note also that even if the results of your query are MORE than 1000, Altavista 
will only give you the first 1000 hits.<br><br>Finally take account of  the fact that 
many 'first positions' on any search-query are being <SPAN STYLE="color: black; background: yellow">SOLD 
for money</span>, or are being 
spammed by the many clowns that spend their time trying to outsmart the anti-spamming 
algorithms of all main search engines.
<br>
In Altavista words are indexed by their location AND their placement on the page (it makes 
an helluva 
difference, for ranking purposes, 
if the key words are in the title, in the abstract, in the description or in the text).
<br>
<bR>
Altavista does not index non-standard text formats like <SPAN STYLE="color: black; background: yellow">adobe's pdf 
files</span> (google now does, I bet Alta and the 
others will HAVE TO follow soon, eheh). Alta does not list excessively big files (5 megabytes), password-based access pages (obviously), and dynamic information, such as pages generated by a cgi script.<br>
Scooter, Altavista's spider, also registers the date of the document and, which was quite a 
clever invention, <SPAN STYLE="color: black; background: yellow">the distance between different 
keywords</span>, 
assuming that they are reciprocally related if they are close to each other. Other search engines do 
not do that, 
hence the differnces when using the NEAR operator... maybe the most important boolean operator for searching 
purposes.
<br><br>
The <SPAN STYLE="color: black; background: yellow">frequency of words</span> on a page is quite a complicated parameter, because spammers (especially in the old times) used this as a quick method to get their pages in the first positions.
Most of the people inside 'search engines algos cracking' are either spammers or 
commercial operators intent on 'pushing' their client sites into the first ranking 
positions. Since the average zombie user would never dream to go 
behyond the first 20 results ranked (<b>if ever!</b>: most lusers 
won't even look to the second page of their results!), 
high rankings on the 
first result page(s) are - as you may expect - of paramount relevance 
(and commercial value).
<br><br>
Each search engine has a set of specific algorithms, of course. This 'pool' of algos 
is responsible for the different results you'll get when querying.  
Spammers are thus compelled to (try to) reverse ALL these algos 
and then build a SET OF DIFFERENT PAGES each targeted through its  
specific keywords and structure for one single main search engine.
<bR>Would you always present the same page to the  different search engines
spiders, you would fare well on one engine and fail miserably on others. 
<br>For instance, while one search engine will give high relevancy to 
keyword occurrence in one position, others will ignore it. 
<br><br>
<center><font size=+2>
Leeching from the spammers</font></center><br>
Hence it pays to perform specific searches for a given target on as many search engines 
as possible and compare the generated pages of THE SAME SITE. 
You'll quickly discover that they are differently structured, and you'll be able to 
'leech' some useful knowledge from the bastard commercial spammers that spend their 
working nights and days doing just that, eheh&nbsp;:-)<br><br>
Additionally, some spammers are now running "stealth keywords" hoping that others
wont be able to detect if they are viewing true keywords or bogus keywords.  
You can get around this somewhat if you use a browser or a browser-firewall 
combination that 
allows you to set both the USER_AGENT and the referring URL. 
By setting the USER_AGENT to <u>one of the major search spiders</u> (look in 
your site's own loggings to see how they declare themselves :-) and by setting  
the referring URL to null, you can sometimes trick spammers' web 
pages into thinking you are the spider of one of the major search 
engines and being able to see <u>the juicy real set of keywords</u>. It's amazing 
how often this works. I can't understand why the search engines themselves 
don't use rotating spiders' names.
<br>

<br>
Indeed there's a lot of money currently raining into this specific field... run around 
the search engines algos with your hat upside down and you'll surely get a part of it. 
Yet be warned: 
I have noticed that searchers and algo-reversers overly interested in money don't 
understand much of what's really going on under the hood... they always have a 
too 'contingent' attitude, their 'money' aims inevitably cover -soon or later- their 
original 'knowledge' aims... A nice "legge del 
contrappasso" if you understand what I mean.
<bR><bR>
Let's summarize some important points  you should remember when searching 
with Altavista, I'll just list them here to give an idea of the 
<SPAN STYLE="color: black; background: yellow">depth of understanding</span> you need to search effectively with the main search 
engines:
<br><bR>

   
<center><table border=1 width=88%><tr><td bgcolor="#C6E7C6"><center><font size=+3>Basic Alta's 
recall</font></center></td></tr></table><br>
</center></center>
<ul><li><font color=red>!!</font> ALWAYS use the advanced search with boolean operators and result ranking options. 
</li><li> <font color=red>!!</font> Phrase searching - through heavy use of <font color=blue>""</font> - is the <i>sine qua non</i> when cutting through the web.
</li><li> <font color=red>!!</font> The 
rule is: case sensitive name searching. Lower case retrieves either lower 
or upper case. Upper case kills all other case occurrences. Note that 
<B style="color:black;background-color:#ffff66">Altavista</B> IS 
accent and character sensitive.
</li><li> <font color=red>!!</font> Boolean logic (AND, OR, AND NOT, NEAR) should be 
used <font color=blue>only</font> in advanced search, <u>do not</u> use this in altavista's 
simple search form, nor in 
the advanced search 'sort' box. Always remember that the so-called simple search always 
defaults to OR (you can use it nevertheless for a 'quick and dirty' search session).
</li><li> <font color=red>!!</font> Subsearching inside sort box<br>Result 
ranking through sortbox... you MUST understand this! You should use  
 the results ranking criteria "Sort by" box <u>whenever possible</u> or you'll get a 
 less useful   
unsorted list. For instance, if you're looking for <U>all</U> "searching and seeking" related  
pages but have a particular interest in filtering, type <font color=blue>filtering</font> 
in the "Results 
Ranking Criteria" space in order to bring <u>those</U> useful listings to the top. Incredibly useful 
addition!
</li><li> <font color=red>!!</font> Field limiting: title: ~ url: ~ link: ~ host: ~ domain: ~ anchor: ~ text: ~ image: ~
 applet:<br>You will realize how 
important this "field limiting" approach is only once you will have tried it, therefore 
 just try it: <i>probieren 
geht Über studieren</i>
</li><li> <font color=red>!!</font> Truncation: <font color=blue>*</font> ~ 
<font color=blue>**</font> ~ <font color=blue>?</font><br> Either you use truncation or 
you will be truncated!
</li></ul>

Write it down and remember it: for queries at Altavista the best 
method is ALWAYS advanced search with boolean logic (and field limiting) and then 
heavy use of the sort box.
<br><br>

Anyway even knowing how the main search engines operate and reversing 
their algos is not enough for a good searcher: in order to search 
effectively you must also know that there are important seeking 
resources elsewhere. But first you must understand that you smear 
your data around everytime you're on the web!
