Please excuse my English. Mais je craigne que mon Français soit
encore pire.
There are also sound terminological reasons to use English during
today's workshop. I will, however, answer in French to your
questions afterwards, if needs be. Note that I wont give many references 
supporting my statements. References 
are not necessary among searchers: once stated -for instance- that  
the diameter of the web is around 19 clicks, you have already enough data (angles) 
to find all necessary references by yourselves, and then some. You'll be able 
to check or refute such a statement on your own. That's the beauty 
of websearching. Reminds medieval "Quellenforschung" techniques. Yep, you should search for 
that as well&nbsp;:-)
<br><br>
<center><font size=+2>
HOW TO SEARCH THE WEB<br>volume, diameter and structure</font></center><br>
First of all you must  understand the incredible <font
color=blue>depth</font>, but also the amazing <font
color=blue>limits</font> of the web.
<br><br>
Let's see... how many fairy tales do you think human beings have
ever written since the dawn of human culture? <br>
How many songs has our race sung? <br>
How many pictures have humans drawn? <br>
How many books in how many languages have been compiled? <br>
The mind shudders, eh?

<br>
<br>
Nevertheless (unless you're really ill-fated in your queries)
every song,
every image, every text, every book and every software program are
now being stored -with fewer
and fewer exceptions- on the web.
<br>
I'm not exaggerating. Whole national libraries are going massively
on-line
in some godforsaken country at this very moment. Tumbling prices for scanners, hard
disks and web-connection  made this possible. <br>
In fact every media product is already there... somewhere, albeit
buried under huge mountains of futilities and commercial crap.
<br><br>
But there are even more important goodies than media products out
there. There are SOLUTIONS! Imagine you're an administrator, or a
consumer defender, or a lawyer, or a scientist, or simply yourself
when seeking a solution, doesn't matter a solution to what, ça
c'est égale. <br>
Well, the solution to your problem is there. Actually you'll
probably find MORE THAN ONE solution to your current problem, and
maybe you'll be even able to build on what you'll have found to
develop another further approach. <br>
Out there, on the web, somewhere: different laws, alien
approaches, original methods, unique tactics, new solutions,
proposals you would have never thought of in order to solve your
local "provincial" problem in -say- French Nantes, have been
found and tried out (maybe in Spanish) in -say- Buenos Aires (or
vice versa, or anywhere else under any other language ~ nation ~
sky ~ latitude). <br>
Alas! You desperately need that info, but you wont be able to find
it... if you don't know how to search...<br>
They are there, somewhere, but -like a tantalizing juicy fruit- just out of your reach.
<br>
That happens -most of the times- because you're not able to search  the web
effectively. Effective searching -on the web- is nowadays
a very important gift. Once you learn it, it wont matter any more
if the info, or the program, or the solution, or the picture
you're looking for, is freely available, or kept prisoner inside
a hidden database in order to make money with it, or buried
beneath tons of commercial advertisement crap. You'll find it
wherever it is, cutting through the web-pudding with the dissecting
 sharpness of your seeker's logical swords (and tools).
<br> <br>
We will learn the basic approaches, right here, today. You'll be
able to apply them again and again, for a long time. I believe 
you won't forget what we'll learn today... but you'll judge by
yourself how useful this could be. Note that 
these approaches are mostly simple and almost
banal... when you examine them <I>a posteriori</I>&nbsp;:-).
<br><br>
As usual, I also want to underline the 
<SPAN STYLE="color: black; background: yellow">cosmic power</span> that
<u>software reverse engineering</u> can give you. Therefore I will
close this workshop demonstrating a simple technique to get rid of
advertisement banners planted inside software (using the latest
version of the very good 'Opera' browser as example and target). Since this approach
does not require any particular software reversing skill and can
thus be applied by anyone of normal intelligence, it should
help to put a nice stop to a pestering habit  that utterly annoys me&nbsp;:-)<br><br>

Let's start from the very beginning: what's the web and what does
it look like? As you'll see this matters quite a lot when
searching. 3  and a half milliard (billions). That's the volume.
<br><br>
<IMG SRC="growthpa.gif" width=513 height=398></a><br><br>
Today's web <SPAN STYLE="color: black; background: yellow">depth</span> is anyone's guess, nobody really knows how big it is, 
but the most realiable data give for  the beginning of
February 2001 (today), around 3.500.000.000 pages (that's 3 and a half 
<u>milliard</u> pages, duh). The most capable search engines
(google, fast and altavista... when their servers are not
overloaded) cover <u>at best</u> a small part of it. Let's hope
 one third (crossing our fingers and our toes for good measure&nbsp;;-) but even this appears optimistic: 
 it looks more and more like 
 they are simply not able to keep the pace of growth.<br><br>
Search engines are not enough (by a long shot not enough) in order to search this huge bulk 
of scattered information, 
therefore different methods MUST be used to search the web.
<br><br>Since we are dealing with web dimensions, let's have
quickly a look at its <SPAN STYLE="color: black; background: yellow">diameter</span> as well.<br>
As strange as it may seem to you, the <u>diameter</u> of the main
portion of the web (the "bulk" aka "central core") is relatively small: around 19
links (also called 'degrees' in this contest)  on average. Since the average number of links per page 
is seven (even
if on many sites you'll find hundreds of links), given the
(presumed) dimensions of the web you can hop from any Internet 
site  to any other one (yep!) using on average just  19 clicks. This limit will not increase 
much with the growth of the web (there's a logarithmical correlation) and may 
increase to a maximum of 21 or 22 links MAX (on average). This is also called the 
"small world" phenomenon. This said the real chances that you can reach at all (not on average) 
from any random site 
any other random site <SPAN STYLE="color: black; background: yellow">CLICKING ONLY FOWARD</span> 
are just around 25%. The bigger a site (node) the higher number of pages it will have with specific and often unrelated 
links. Note, moreover, that a path from site A to site B DOES NOT imply that there's also 
a path from site B to site A (duh). This, as we'll see in a moment, is of paramount importance 
for seekers.
<br><br>

The structure of the web, why should you care?</font></center><br>



Since the best 'global' (or 'main') search engines cover one third of the web at best, 
you must often resort to other methods of searching if you want to find what you were 
looking for. These 'other methods' depend of course from the nature of your target 
(a specific information, file, music, book, document or image; information about 
somebody; hidden or classified information inside a non-public database... 
and so on)  but resolve most of the time to a 'broader search' 
through local and regional search engines, a 'combing' search on usenet newsgroups 
and on various messageboards, an advanced search using self-made ad hoc bots 
(mostly in perl nowadays, but you can of course use ole good C or powerful 
php or REBOL or whatever you want to build a bot, even -yeeerk!- Visual Basic 
if you fancy), and the various other techniques like combing, klebing, guessing, 
hacking hidden databases and stalking that we'll (in part) discuss  to-day.

<br><br>
<IMG SRC="theweb5.jpg" width=532 height=380></a>
<br><br>
The structure of the web (from a searcher's standpoint) is of paramount 
importance to decide which techniques you should apply and where. Let's 
start with the '<SPAN STYLE="color: black; background: yellow">Nucleus</span>'. Imagine a huge bulk of nearly 3,5 milliard pages, 
all mutually interconnected. This is the CORE of the web, strongly interconnetted pages, sites, 
usenet newsgroups, messageboards, you name it.  
This is the 'web' as you know it, where you 
happily browse from link to link smearing all your personal data along, 
as we'll see later, when we'll examine some anonymity themes. It is not easy 
to represent the web threedimensionally. The Nucleus is far from being a 
compact and uniform 'ball' of  mutually interconnetted sites, you should think at a 
fractal like entity, with almost 'organic' features, with spaghetti-similar 
'tubes' that quickly 
connect some areas while leaving 'link-holes' in many places, it would probably 
look like a chump of Gruyère&nbsp;:-)
<br><br>
As the image behind my shoulders should make clear, only a relatively small part of the Nucleus has 
been indexed by <SPAN STYLE="color: black; background: yellow">any</span> search engine.
<br><br>
Take note that a part of this huge bulk is 
<SPAN STYLE="color: black; background: yellow">USENET</span>, an incredible 
mass of micro-information, which can frequently give very useful results, 
especially for seeking, combing, klebing and stalking purposes. 
<br>We'll get back to Usent, later, when dealing with micro-searching techniques.

<bR>
<br>
So, back to our 'image' of the structure of the web. We have (today) 
this 3,5 milliard page Nucleus (the bulk) with a part of it consisting 
of usenet newsgroups (articles, images, files and people). Only a part of 
this core has been indexed by search engines. Never forget this. 
<bR>
For searching purposes we are now going to divide the web into parts 
that <SPAN STYLE="color: black; background: yellow">link to</span> and/or 
<SPAN STYLE="color: black; background: yellow">are linked from</span> the Nucleus.
<br><br>
First of all there's a big area called "<SPAN STYLE="color: black; background: yellow">Outside linked</span>". This consists 
of  pages and files that the Nucleus links towards, but that do NOT point 
reciprocally back to the Nucleus. Thus they are 'outside' the reciprocally connected 
bulk, yet they are not particularly difficult to find. In order to 
search this part of the web, mostly made of non-hidden databases 
(imagine a huge collection of images, for isntance) you'll use the same techniques 
(power-searching, combing and building your own searchbots) commonly used in order 
to search the Nucleus.<br><br>
Then there's another big area called  
"<SPAN STYLE="color: black; background: yellow">Outside linkers</span>". The 
pages located in this area of the web "point" to the Nucleus but 
are not pointed back from it.  Imagine as an example the "personal 
links" pages of a scientist: lotta juicy links to the Nucleus yet 
no need to publicise their existence. There is -per definition-  
<SPAN STYLE="color: black; background: yellow">NO LINK</span> from the Nucleus that you browse and 
peruse to this part of the Web. 
 A page with 
information you may need is there, somewhere, without any link 
whatsoever that could bring you to it. <br>
The "outside linkers" are a part of the web you cannot reach 
using "normal" search techniques, since no link whatsoever 
points to them. Yet they may hoard knowledge you need. There 
are, fortunately, some techniques that you can apply in order
to find them. The most common one being 
<SPAN STYLE="color: black; background: yellow">klebing</span>, as we'll see 
in a minute.
<bR><br>
Then we have a big area (or to be more precise, a very big 
quantity of small areas scattered around the Nucleus, but I didn't know how to draw it) of 
<SPAN STYLE="color: black; background: yellow">hidden databases</span> which are connected to the bulk, 
but that can be accessed (in theory) only conditionally. 
<br>
In fact these 'hidden databases' contain pages or files that the
 Nucleus points to, and that may (or may not) point back to the
 Nucleus. Yet for commercial (or other access-restrictive) reasons 
 visitors of sites located here are supposed to "pay" (or adhere 
 to some "clan") in order to access them. As you may imagine, 
 these pages are NOT mutually linked (but they might point to 
 some "outside linkers" as well).<br>
Fortunately (for us, unfortunately for the commercial bastards) 
the web was originally built in order to share (and neither to 
hoard nor to sell) knowledge. And thus the building blocks, 
the "basic frames" behind the structure of the web are still 
helpful for those that want to share .<bR>
If I may dare a comparison: exactly as it is pretty easy to break 
any software protection written in a higher language if you know 
(and use) some assembly, so it is easy to break any server-user 
delivered "barrier" to a given database if you know (and can 
"outflank" and/or exploit) the protocols used by browsers and servers.<br>
Let's simply say that it is relatively easy to access all pages 
in this "hidden databases" area of the web reversing the (simple) 
perl or javascript tricks used to keep them "off limits" for zombies 
and lusers ("losers users"). A sound knowledge of Internet protocols and 
the ability of <SPAN STYLE="color: black; background: yellow">Guessing</span> 
 (which can be a very sofisticated Art) represents an incredibly powerful approach 
 in this field.<br>
<br>This facility of access is extremely worrying, since a not too 
small part of this area is made of so-called "politically and strategically 
sensible" data, hidden within military or government servers, 
which are -alas- connected to the web (this being in this contest 
a very big mistake <i>eo ipso</i> IMHO).<br>
Since this is a workshop "for the establishment", I'll limit myself 
to point out that if you learn how to search the web you'll find soon, 
and without excessive fatigue, a whole plethora of effective ways to 
access this kind of info as well... should you fancy it.
<br><bR>
But this is exactly the problem we have started with: how do you search 
effectively? Since the invention of the "Altavista-type" of indexing 
texts, search techniques became COMPLETELY different than before. 
Let's have first of all a deeper look inside Altavista.
