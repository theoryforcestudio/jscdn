<font size=+2 color=blue>The importance of subsidiarity and 
'micro-searching' for seekers</font><br><font size=+1>

Webrings, homepages clusters, maillists, messageboards, national engines, usenet
<br>
So-called "local" search engines are extremely 
important to fetch info. Freepages providers, counters, 
stats applications and all other finalized search engines... 
that you can use at leisure... 
for fun, searching purposes, combing 
and/or knowledge profit.
<br><br>
There's noway I can give you in the short time of my slot a complete description of 
the huge plethora of tools available.

<br><br>
<font size=+2 color=blue>Usenet</font><br><font size=+1>
Among the different 'local' areas of the web, 
usenet is without any doubt extremely important for searchers, 
and Dejanews (was one of the few remaining usenet repositories, has been now bought 
by google)
 has proved 
to be an unconturnable service for seekers.<br>
To 'correctly' access usenet you should use specific news reader software, but 
to peruse Usenet, you just access a news server, which is nothing else 
than a computer system which provides shared storage for Usenet articles. 
Usenet must use "shared storage" because its total volume is 
<SPAN STYLE="color: black; background: yellow">HUGE</span> and <SPAN STYLE="color: black; background: yellow">Transient</span>. 
Usenet articles are kept in central locations and thus can be "shared" by many readers. 
This is a typical feature of the 'web of old' that still survives, all commercial 
diseases notwithstanding.

<br> Each server has ONLY A PART of the total articles of Usenet. Your news 
reader (or your browser) can only display articles which are present on the news 
server you access. 
If an article is not present on the server, it is because either that article 
has never arrived at your server, or it has been cancelled, or else it has expired.

<br><br>

Because there is a limited amount of storage on a local news server, 
articles "must" expire. But fortunately, the accumulated body of information 
of Usenet is not lost: There are a number of WWW sites which archive and 
index Usenet articles. Thus you can retrieve posts which have expired 
(or perhaps had not even arrived) at your local news server.
<br>
Instead of asking a question in a news group, you can use the Usenet 
archives to retrieve articles which discussed your question long ago.
By searching first and posting questions only if you find no answers, 
everyone will be much happier (this is valid for messageboards as 
well, btw :-)<bR>
Searching usenet first you will get an answer faster. You don't have to 
wait for your message to reach the far corners of the world. 
You don't have to rely on someone nice enough to write a reply. 
Perhaps those in the know aren't listening right now, even if 
they answered the same question in depth in the past.
Searching offers an added advantage: you will also find the groups 
which have an interest in your topic. Do not underestimate it. So 
if you cannot find the answer in the archived messages, you will 
have a good starting place to ask questions.<br>
<bR>
Note that most Internet service subscriptions include access to a news server 
which you should be able to use for free. In order to make a profit, many news servers are 
not open to the general public (ahem... in theory :-) in fact in recent 
years they have been more and more commercially "bastardised" for 
exclusive use by "customers".
<bR>
Keep in mind that usenet searching can be VERY time-consuming, and 
that some special skills are needed to perform it with a relative 
degree of effectiveness.<br>
A final word of WARNING: there are a series of anonymity 
concerns that you should consider when posting on usenet. 
You may consider visiting sites with a section 
giving advices about <a href="https://searchlores.nickifaulk.com/paris/noanon.htm">anonymity</a>, like mine :-)

<font size=+2 color=blue>Local search engines</font><font size=+1>
<br><bR>
Microsearching (local searching) means taking advantage of a plethora of tools that 
the web offers, from the specific search engines that most homepages clusters have, to 
the webrings search engines, the maillists search engines and the 'local' search engines like 
AOL and hitbox. Public 'free' counters are for instance a very useful resources when searching 
specific material, especially if they are categorized by the users themselves, like hitbox. 
Micro/local searching is very valuable in many fields: try your own "hobbyes" 
searches on any personal homepage cluster à la Geocities or xoom (or fortunecity, or thousand other 
"free" page providers), compare with the results you would get through the main search engines 
 and 
you'll immediately understand what I mean.
<br><hr>
<font size=+2 color=blue>Regional search engines</font><font size=+1>
<br><bR>
Regional search engines are even more important in a more and more international web.
Take note that among the future www developments <font color=blue>cross language information 
retrieval</fonT>, or CLIR (which 'grossomodo' means querying in one language 
documents in many languages and implies a lot of semanthic algos) will 
become more and more important.<br><br>
The searching value of "Subsidiarity" (a term which <i>per se</i> is 
nothing else than a synonym for 
feudalisation in the European Union's jargon) is <u>extremely</u> high. 
So-called "regional" search engines are incredibly important for fetching 'less biased'
info. As you may expect, russian, chinese, indian, japanese and 'you-name-them' collections of datas 
have a completely different 'cut' vis-à-vis the stuff you can find 
in the euroamerican world. (This is of course true for all sort of data: 
files, images, sounds, films, software...
the well-known motto being "<font color=blue>always go ftp-fishing far from the copyright-obsessed 
euroamericans</fonT>).<br>Anyway there are huge differences (in quality, 'cut' and bias) 
between 'european' and 'american'  
data colections as well.<br>
<bR>The value of critical information is increasing, 
and such information is now - for the first time in the history of 
our race - available for everybody (once he knows how to search: unfortunately
the volume of commercial rubbish you'll have to wade through is 
increasing exponentially).
<br>
<br>The web is an Ocean of knowledge... 
about two centimeters deep. 
Finding rare snippets of information among tons of crap is getting more and more difficoult
 because on a more and more 'commercial' web you are compelled to wade through 
<u>a lot</u> of noise to get to the signal.<br>Most search engines 
DO NOT index the most interesting parts 
of the web: they index commercial over educational sites, 
'popular' sites (read sites loved by the zombies) over relatively 
unknown sites and US sites over European sites... Well you should at least try to 
compensate  this last disadvantage using search engines located outside the States.
<br><br>
Do not underestimate the task of a seeker, though: 
even mastering the 'subsidiariety searching' lore, 
and knowing some elementary 
microsearching techniques 
is not enough to be a good seeker: in order to
search effectively you <u>must</u> also know some more 'broad'  
'reversing techniques', else you'll never be able to build your 
own bots.<hr width=44%>
