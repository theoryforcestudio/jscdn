<i>Well, the subject of this page was, as far as I know, 
never treated on the Web until +ORC famous essay, back in 1997.<br>
I too believe, like +ORC, that publicity has taken an 
insopportable place in our lifes, and that we are MADE and DRILLED 
to consume, and nothing more.<br>
This page carries a very interesting example, 
written by +ORC himself in 1997:<br><b><h2>supermarket enslavement secrets</b></h2><br></i><hr size="3">

<h3><font COLOR="#FF0000">__Supermarket enslavement techniques, by +ORC, first pulished in
March 1997__</font></h3>
</center><br><center>Ok, Fravia convinced me to publish separate without 
interpolating all this in my tut, coz it would have been too heavy, 
even if in my opinion it is part of cracking and he may be 
wrong, coz nobody will read my crap if I don't mix it with 
software cracking info, coz people do not want to learn to be
free, and to free them we have sadly to &quot;circumvent&quot; them with more or 
less the same techniques that our enemies use to enslave them :=)<br>
<br>Let's crack the very 
temples of the enemies of the humanity and poetry, 
the prisons where we are forced to buy and consume... 
let's show all idiots the WHIPS that are used to enslave them... 
as always light comes through knowledge<br>
Remeber that NOTHING is casual in this awful society where people are 
CULTIVATED to consume and nothing else than that. Around you almost
 everything has a &quot;secret&quot; meaning, that you are not supposed 
 to see, understand or crack (see the codebar example in my C1 lesson, 
 which is my best contribution so far to this cause :=)
Knowledge is real power... it's not just a phrase! And Internet gives 
us (at least until now) the possibility to spread knowledge. They spread 
shit ads, useless information and publicity, we spread &quot;real&quot; knowledge... we'll win<br>
<br>Let's begin with 
some simple basic counter-intelligence work... You'll never watch again your 
mall or supermarkt with the same eyes after having read this<br>
<br></center><hr>
<b>The entrance is on the right, yet you walk leftwards, duh</b>
In all modern supermarket the slave MUST follow a counterclockwise 
direction: 95% of the population of the world has a slight imperfected 
equilibrium, they tend to the left... if you leave somebody alone lost 
in the desert (don't do it :=) he'll begin tu turn round counterclockwise. 
That's the reason most modern supermarket have a &quot;counterclockwise&quot; 
layout... which btw has other consequences and hidden commercial meanings, as you will 
see in the following<br>
<br><b>Why do they start with fresh fruit?</b><br>
Reason Number 1:  
People coming inside a supermarket tend to conserve the velocity and the 
inertia of the streets... they would &quot;jump&quot; the first 10 meters of 
merchandises if you did not stop them with the explosion of colours and 
smells that only fresh fruit can offer. Notice, moreover, that merchandises in 
the first ten meters are almost wortless just in case: potatoes, onions... the 
expensive fruits-sorts are more distant, so that people will be able to pick them once 
having 'calmed down'.<br>
Reason number 2: 
The supermarket are subjected to the strong concurrence of the &quot;discount&quot; 
malls (&quot;poor people&quot; supermarkts, the ones with ugly boxes and cheaper 
prices), which (mostly) do not have fresh fruit, but only conserves... 
first thing when he comes in: the slave must be assured, palping a red 
nice apple, that he is in an &quot;exquisite&quot; special frish shop (little does and 
should the slave know about the products used to 'polish' and shine that 
apple, btw).<br>
<br>
Note that the disposition of the fruit and vegetables is NOT casual 
(far from it). The whole point in supermarket enslavement is that the 
very few thing that are really useful and 'must' be bought (say toilet paper, 
sugar, salt or wodka) are overwhelmed 
and interpolated with completely useless products and/or with much more 
expensive varieties and qualities of the same kind, because of the huge profits on those 
articles and of the smaller profits on basic products.<br>
<br>
<b>Light dances in your eyes, sounds enter your hears
</b><br>Orange and apples with a lot of mirrors, Bananes and pears with a
 green surrounding, salads and potatos with clear light... red for meat 
 (coz white light would make it look greysh) and so on... have a look at the illumination 
tricks in your mall next time you are compelled to go in.<br>
Note also that the quiet music 
is necessary: the supermarkt would seem &quot;dead&quot; without it, but at the 
same time music must 
not be so heavy that it may disturb any consumeristic concentration... 
and it changes too... they know exactly at which time 
of the day "seniores" and at which time "youngsters" slaves are ususally 
consuming inside the malltrap, therefore
you'll have music which is &quot;calibrated&quot; on the time of the day.
<br><br>
<b>Expensive is easy, cheap is difficult
</b><br>Producte are so positionated that the expensive ones are ALWAYS positioned
&quot;towards&quot; the march direction of the slave: at the best height to be 
picked up. The cheaper varities of the same articles are always &quot;behind&quot; the
march direction of the slave, and/or a little too low or a little to high.<br>
Now stop and have a look at the varieties of a given product, say whisky, or 
honey (not wodka, it's not necessary, you should always and only drink 
 Moskowskaja :=)<br>
Humans (euroamericans) stroll with the eyes from left to right (like you are 
 doing now, reading my lines), therefore notice how the CHEAPEST varities 
 of a given product are on the left, the more expensive on 
 the right, in the hope 
 that slave's hands will be quicker as slave's brain (as it's often the case 
 nowadays).<br><br>
<b>Funny, the fridges open all in a weird sense</b><br>
Yeah, the doors are made in order to enforce the slave to see immediately 
other products, inside ANOTHER fridge as soon as he closes one where he has 
already 'consumed'. Would the doors close normally, his nose would be 
back against products he has already bought: no good. Note the disposition of the 
products inside the ice-boxes on the floor, too... it's far from casual as 
you can see... notice how far away are those products and how easy to pick up
 are these? Goddy! I believe we should drive school classes through the malls 
 explaining all these tricks to the little future slaves!<br>
<br>
<b>May I NOT help you?</b><br>
You'll NEVER hear a supermarket employee asking you &quot;may I help you&quot; in 
normal cases (unless you really and badly need it and you chase him), because 
that would limit the 
possibility of you buying a lotta other useless products instead of what
 you need, it would break the 
&quot;magic&quot;, and in that dreaded case the slave could 
even come to the nasty idea to lower the blick on the trolley, instead of 
filling it -overwhelmed by soo muuuch choice- with everything he sees.<br>
Besides the employees are really 
busy &quot;filling&quot; the spaces... it's very important that the products are 
positionated at a predetermined in-between distance and density... 
too many people on to narrow 
space and some slaves would &quot;put back&quot; the product they have in their hands, 
instead of deposing it in the trolley... an empty gap in an 
alley would break the magic<br>
<br>
<b>What are stoppers?</b><br>
Stoppers are the &quot;dynamic&quot; part of a supermarket... most of the slaves come 
here twice in a week (at least) and do not want to see always the same things 
in the same places (they could come to the -right- conclusion that they 
are being 'drilled to buy') even if they at the same time want to be 
reassured... &quot;I know where's the wine&quot;. Everything must stay where it was, 
but a part must move... hence the stoppers, little mountains of &quot;offers&quot;, 
toilet paper to-day, shampoos to-morrow.<br>
<br><b>Capturing the audience</b><br>
Supermarkets have  also a 'local' hinterland as well. People that live in the vicinities 
and/or that 
have to 'pass' near it on the way back home from the office 
will tend after a while to use the same one more and 
more, for 'simplicity' reasons.<br>These people have been 'caught' by  the supermarket: they are 
its 'captives'. Now, once your captives' base is great enough there is no reason no 
more to give them real choices, is it? Wouldn't be better - and more rentable - if 
all this people would buy grossomodo the same few products types? And would not it be 
even better if those same products would be not only sold but also <u>produced</u> by you? 
And that is exactly what regularly happens with all big chains: 
the 'own brand' products are being pushed more and more, through mere phisical 
presence and/or through advertisement or three for two schemes, while at the same time the choice of alternatives 
decreases more and more. It begins with potatoes, eggs and 'white products' of all kinds, 
it ends with "everything" offered as 'own brand'. <br>
Thus the supermarkets, born <i>inter alia</i> with the implicit promise of a broader choice for consumers, 
try instead to reduce 
it more and more every time there is a possibility to do so.

<br>
<br>
<b>Cry baby cry</b>
There are queues at the cashier. Note that there are almost ALWAYS queues: the 
turns are so calculated as to spare personal whenever possible, that 
means that there is always a 'queue lenght' that is considered 'acceptable' (the slave 
will not burst off leaving the charriot and jelling "never again!") and 
that they try to avoid, for obvious profit reasons, to have cashiers waiting 
for clients instead that the other way round. Bresides: there is money to 
be made through queues! In fact that's the right moment to bite the
 slave's kids, which are terribly annojed and exige the products that have 
been 
purposely put on the two sides of the cashier queue. Watch them, look at
their prices... very very interesting this is
really the &quot;lower instinct&quot; part: All these articles are chosen and
calculated to give maximum profit, all products you would NEVER in your life 
come to buy but here, coz this is the only real (compelled) 
&quot;canyon&quot; that the slave must cross... &quot;Dad, may I have this 
and that?&quot;. &quot;Why shouldn't I buy those nice mints?&quot;<br>
Notice how these products are MUCH more expensive than the 
&quot;three for one&quot; confections of the same product that are sold inside the 
shop somewhere... but where? You will not know, coz that's exactly the 
sort of products you normally don't buy! How many time do I have to 
prove it to you<br> Teach 
your kid to use the waiting time to completely upset the order of 
these products, or do it yourself. These shelfs can also be very useful 
to dump all useless products that you did buy without noticing ever after 
having read this... best of all is to dump there a couple of frozen 
icecreams boxes upside down, they will slowly leak everything on so 
artfully positioned peppermints :=)<br>
<br>
<b>D'you want our &quot;superadvantage&quot; nice plastic card?</b>
<br>No! No! No! It's only a cheap, dirty trick to gather all possible data 
on your 
comportament whithout ever having to raise a finger. They'll know how much 
and when and where you drink/shit/eat/
love/cry/wash/sleep/etc and stuff their databases for free (notice how the 
&quot;discounts&quot; are lilliputian in comparison with what they steal you through 
the abovementioned tricks... did you know that 35% of the fridge products 
you buy will go directly from fridge to dustbin? That's the real average,
 duh)<br>
<br>
So let's battle against them! Codebar! Understand! Explain others! Free the 
stupid slaves... watch the world around you free from petty convention and 
understand in what for an awful mess you are condemned to live!

An addition, by Michel (slightly edited by fravia+):<pre><font color="blue">
- Why do they start with fresh fruit? (addendum)
Fresh fruits are fragile.  If you put them in the bottom of your
caddy and then lay heavy conserves on it, it will be a mess...  
So you have to begin with the conserves (near the exit), then 
have to go back to the fruits, then return once more towards the exit.  
Result : you cross shelves three times instead of one !

- The entrance is left
The &quot;counterclockwise&quot; turning is due to the fact that the right leg
is usually stronger... the 90% of the population is right-handed (or
&quot;right-legged&quot; in this case ?).  So it is normal to turn slightly to 
the left.  

Funny, but some shops seem to experiment the opposite: a big european 
furniture shop (IKEA) has choosen for some of its shops (in France for 
instance, yet not elsewhere) a &quot;clockwise direction&quot; layout.  
The idea is probably that in this way you will browse through these 
shops more slowly, instead of choosing the &quot;optimum&quot; -quicker- trajectory.

- &quot;Hypermarket&quot;
I don't know if this concept exists in english.  In french (my native 
language, as you probably have already guessed), it means a big supermarket 
which sells not only food: also clothing, tools, and so on.
In these &quot;hypermarkets&quot;, things are in part different from the supermarkets: 
they have plenty of room, so they can mix the food and the non-food (one
shelf of food, and one shelf of non-food).  So when you have taken -say- 
your usual vodka and you want to get your peanuts, you *will* pass through
the shelf where they sell those magnificents-and-yet-not-so- expensive beer 
glasses...
Moreover at the beginning of the shop there is always a &quot;starter&quot;, with all 
the current &quot;discounts&quot;, and usually also clothes, wine and other completely 
useless gadgets...

- Men and women (non P.C. section ;-)
Usually, women are going to the supermarket.  That's why in the
&quot;hypermarkets&quot; (see above), the clothing is always between the entry
and the food.
But in the last 15 years, with women working more and more, men have 
begun to go shopping, instead of their wives.  Result: in the commercials, 
on your TV you are now brainwashed about &quot;men taking care of themselves&quot;, 
and instead of the good old &quot;AQUA VELVA&quot; and &quot;Eau de Cologne 4711&quot;, which 
were more or less the only things you would have bought (if ever) in the 
pre-enslavement old good times you now have an icredible plethora of 
'parfums pour homme' (note the <u>form</u> of parfums' bottles, btw, which 
as usual has a pavlovian meaning); and not only parfums: have a look: shampoo
&quot;formule homme&quot;,  Gilette Sensor-Excel-Plus-Double-..., and so on!
They realized they have a lot of new potential gullible slaves, and they 
found an easy way to get'em... it's easy to foresee: parfums for kids (already 
started with totthpaste) and for dogs and cats...

- Generalization: slave's surroundings
These concepts are true for the supermarkets.  These last 10 years
in Europa, it has generalized (an idea coming from US, as it is older
there) to what we call &quot;commercial center&quot;: a supermarket is never
alone, you always have other shops around: jewelry, hi-fi shop,
CD/Video shop, deluxe clothing, fashion clothing, low-price clothing,
even cinemas (in english &quot;theaters&quot; ?), *and* the obligatory Quick or
McDonald...

Ok, that's all.  Thanks for reading ;-)  Complete informations on the
subject must exist somewhere, at least in marketing courses, or
perhaps in psychology, I don't know.  Anyway, it's always good 
stuff to know.

Bye,

An addition, by The Dark One (slightly edited by fravia+):
<p><font color="blue">
As for small additions i'd like to make to two essays...
<br><br>
1. There is +ORC's essay about supermarkets and how they enslave 
you, which mentions the counterclockwise effect. I for myself have 
a small side job in a pathetic attempt to get more 
money to cover my ever growing expenses, and can add to this. 
<br><br>
One time in this sports store, I was told to adjust all the lamps on 
the floor i was working on. Naturally, when i was told to give them a 
little tilt to the left while still illuminating the products (make 
everything look nice and shiny and all that), I had to ask why that 
would have any effect. The story behind it was the same 
counterclockwise effect, but added to that the fact that when the 
lamps are tilted that way, it will invite the customer to keep a 
certain direction. walking in normally and taking the 
counterclockwise route, the customer will see light shining on the 
clothing, walking clockwise, he will have light shining somewhat in 
his eyes... at least in his view of vision. Therefore, what will 
happen is that 'the herd' will take the signals in his 
visual range and most likely amble through the store 
counterclockwise, and end up in front of the cash register, or at 
least not disturb other customers as they browse by moving in an 
opposing direction. To mention another aspect of 'herd behaviour', 
people like to 'follow the leader', and when they see people in front 
of them moving through the whole store, instinctively they will 
follow, thinking 'there must be a reason people look through it'. 
<br><br>
Another thing perhaps is the way you are supposed to approach 
customers. Unlike what's reported by +ORC in his supermarket essay, 
in a store like mine you are naturally deeply instructed to 'press' 
the customer on whether you can help him or her. 
But you don't ask 'can I help you'. <br>
Why not? This immediately implies that you are granting favours, that 
you are in a 'master' position vis-a-vis the customer. You are supposed 
to ask the customer 'can I be of service?', or similar questions along 
the same 'Aladdin's lamp' line, obviously giving the customer a false 
sense of having  the upper hand in the conversation, as well as the 
customer/seller relationship.<br> 
Then the whole verbal selling technique starts, but I guess that is 
beyond the interest of this topic. There are a lot more things to say 
about standing in the kind of store I am in, but I am not sure whether 
this is relevant to the discussion at hand, let alone whether it is of 
major interest. <bR><bR>

I'll quickly mention a few short things I know from other stores, such 
as the fact that the music you hear in stores is <u>naturally</u> always 
programmed. In one of the stores where a colleague of mine once worked  
they even had a rythm added to it, in the sense of numbers being 
played. There would be four 15 minute parts of music, especially 
set to be sort of a subliminal inducer for customers entering at the 
right time. The first part would be sort of a welcoming theme, 
followed by restful lingering, after which you would get a bit 
jazzed up by faster music until the last 15 minutes 'invited' you 
more or less franticly to leave the store again. Most stores work 
with customer counts in order to program store success, where 
the more customers that have visited without buying something, 
the lower the per customer buying amount will be. Another 
interesting point which clarifies obviously why stores usually 
try to herd you out after a certain time; every customer around you 
that doesn't buy anything affects other customers (if they don't buy 
anything, then why should I? this is obviously crap, and so on). 
Lastly, I've heard also from another colleague (it's amazing 
what you can learn if you are willing to infiltrate and search, that's 
what real social engineering for real reversers should be about, btw) 
that in the place she worked in before this one, they worked on 
'sniffing posts'!<br>
What they had done was place on several locations a couple of hidden 
'deodorisers' (for lack of a better word), which would dispense fragrances 
that would complement the feeling you should have with certain products. 
From what I've gathered, back then it wasn't so successful, but they 
are most probably still working on it; if you smell funny stuff in 
a huge store, you know where it comes from. So, if you do, don't just sit there and say 'Ah ja': Investigate, find 
the truth, report it.
<br><br>
Thinking about that, I do remember seeing all kinds of spray cans lately 
in that line of product enhancement. There are cans that I have held in 
my hand that have the 'fresh bakery smell', which can make you think you're 
in a bakery from heaven, and everyone knows by now the 'new car' spraycan 
that is supposed to add that new smell to your car, the smell that you 
only get when you first buy it. Needless to say, fooling people 
means fooling the mind, and fooling the mind is done for a large 
part by fooling the senses. Basically it is so that consumers are treated 
like an heard of stupid cows, that must be lured into buying things they 
don't need in the least for the sake of filling some wallets.
<br><br>
2. An observation on the cigarette ads. In our country (The 
Netherlands), if I remember correctly, the European Union's directives 
sort of restrict cigarette companies to blatantly advertise their product. 
Since I do not either buy cigarettes or search for these ads, I do 
not know for sure how those restrictions lie, or how much they are 
enforced. What I do see right now in advertisements shown in 
cinema's and on billboards is the rather funny shift of 'advertising'.
 <br><br>
Suddenly, the art of sponsering is discovered, and all these 'events' 
pop up with sigarette brands attached to them. This ranges from 
the 'marlboro flashbacks' (bands covering a favorite group) to 
'barclay's fashion awards', and not to forget the 'drum rythm festival' 
(drum being the stuff that you roll before you smoke). Now that 
they are not allowed to advertise openly neither with 'cowboy scenes' 
(see Martine Joly's splendid <a href="marlbo2.htm">essay</a>: Rhetoric 
of advertisement, a "Marlboro Classic" Advertisement analyzed) nor 
stuff like that, they get name recognition by sponsoring these 
events, and naturally make connections with the show involved. Of 
course, the same is being done with beers to some extent, but 
cigarettes right now are the leading players in this game.

 Tracking the Patterns of Supermarket Shoppers<br>(Tagging the slaves)<br><br></center></font>
 RFID tags are being placed on the bottom of  grocery carts in various supermarkets 
 in the States. These tags emit a signal every five 
 seconds that is received by receptors installed at various locations throughout the store. 
 Once collected, the signals are used to chart the position of the grocery cart and record its 
 route through the entire store.
 <br><br>
 The data -- charted for the first time by radio frequency identification (RFID) 
 tags located on consumers' shopping carts -- will change the way retailers 
 in general think about customers and their shopping patterns.<br><br> 

In a new paper called "<a href="PT_1006.pdf">An Exploratory Look at Supermarket Shopping Paths</a>" a marketing professor, working for 
the enslavers,  
and a couple of dangerous "eunucs" of the slavemasters have analyzed this RFID-captured grocery store data, 
focusing exclusively on travel 
patterns without regard to purchase behavior or merchandising tactics. 
<br><br>
Yet the point of the work is, of course, to provide basis in order 
 to refine such <font color=blue>merchandising tactics</font> of the slavemasters 
 and  modify accordingly the <font color=blue>purchase behaviour</font> of the slaves,  having 
them throwing more money inside the gutter of useless "impulse purchases". 
<br><br>
The results, the authors conclude, challenge many long-standing perceptions of shopper travel behavior within a supermarket, 
including ideas related to aisle traffic, special promotional displays, and perimeter shopping patterns.
<br><br>

Using a new "multivariate clustering algorithm," the authors identified 14 distinct grocery store 
travel paths during short, medium and long shopping trips. Based on this information they conclude that:
<ul><li>     Grocery shoppers don't weave up and down all aisles -- a pattern commonly thought to 
dominate store travel. Instead, most shoppers "tend only to travel select aisles, 
and rarely in the systematic up and down patterns most tend to consider the dominant travel pattern."
</li><li>

         Once they enter an aisle, shoppers rarely make it to the other end. 
Instead, they "travel by short excursions into and out of the aisle rather than traversing its entire length."
</li><li>      Shoppers prefer a counter-clockwise shopping experience. They tend to 
shop more quickly as they approach the checkout counters. Shoppers' behavior 
is driven more by their location in the store than the merchandise in front of them.
</li><li>       The perimeter of the store -- often called the "racetrack" -- 
is actually the shopper's home base, not just the space covered between aisles.
 "Whereas previous folklore perpetuated the myth that the perimeter of the store 
 was visited incidental to successive aisle traverses, we now know that it 
 often serves as the main thoroughfare, effectively a home base from which shoppers 
 take quick trips into the aisles," the paper states.
</li></ul>
These findings, the researchers predict, will
 have important implications for store layouts, product placement, 
 end-cap displays, and relationships between aisles and perimeter spaces -- not to mention a
 better understanding of how consumers shop and how retailers and suppliers can respond
  to these patterns. "There is a tremendous amount of research available on why 
  people buy what they buy, but until now there was really no research on 
  tracking the actual buying decision," said one of the authors. 
<br><br>
This new tracking data is a significant addition to shopping data 
stolen from consumers through the introduction of scanner technology, which specifically 
details every item purchased, its price, the name and address of the buyer (through 'fidelity cards' or 
credit cards) and whether a coupon was used. But what the scanner technology doesn't collect is in-store behavior. 
Where did you go to buy that product? What path did you take? Where did you spend time? <font color=blue>In what 
order did you look at product categories</font>? 
These are crucial issues 
in terms of layout, product placement and store profits based on in-store movement and purchase decisions.
<br><br>
The point is, remember, to have people spend money in useless items they did not want to buy at all, as the authors 
of the study openly admit:
<br><br>
 "If you put popular items like milk in the back of the store, 
 do people make more <font color=blue>impulse purchases</font> along the way? Does that actually happen? 
 Just experiment with different products  at the back of the store and check how the slaves' traffic flowed, or changed, 
 because of that."

<br><br>

Packages come in all shapes and sizes, which of course happens

Nothing is casual in our slavemasters/slaves society, as 
good ole +ORC pointed out many years ago, and as  underlines - again and again - the gorgeous "variety"  of
volumes and shapes of many a  product you'r gonna encounter in your supermarket ordeals. And now we'r gonna see WHY.

<br><br>
For many packages the logic basis for the <font color=blue>exterior size</font>
variation (note that the "real" volumetric amount inside the package is completely irrelevant for this discussion) 
is far from obvious (e.g., consider the 
myriad sizes and shapes of shampoos).
<br><br>
Consumers *could* -maybe- overcome the challenge of visually assessing volumes contained
within a variety of shapes -at least in Europe- because shop labels must provide (in smallscript) total amount information.
<br><br>
Therefore if a consumer would wish  to compare product volumes, an obvious solution were to simply
read the shop price labels on the shelf, and compare standard units (e.g., compare fluid deciliters).
<br><br>
However, research has documented that shoppers often do not expend the
seemingly minimal effort to read product label and price information. In fact 
many consumers don't even care about the EXPIRATION DATE tags of diary products. <br>Drilled to recklessly 
consume since their infancy, they are oblivious to 
such considerations.
<br><br>
Slavemasters, of course, take advantage of all possible biases humans have when judging visually package volumes.
<br><br>
This small snippet is intended as a quick and dirty <font color=blue>reversing guide</font> in order to understand WHY a container 
is made thattaway. A "volume deceiving" counterguide (a classical example of <font color=blue>volume deceiving</font> is the most common  
"coca cola" bottle: looks big thanks 
to all those "sensual" hourglass curves and thick glass, yet the actual content is quite small, as anyone can see when 
pouring its real liquid content out)
<br><br>
The slavemasters' interest lies exactly in this
<font color=blue>visual perception of package size</font>. Visual input usually dominates other modalities in
perception. Consumers shop with their eyes,
 and exert little effort to search for volume information on package labels. 
 The dependence on visual assessment of volume
has made important <font color=blue> the kinds of containers</font> people encounter
while  consuming products.
<br><br> Anyone can see the difference between a two liters bottle and a one liter bottle, 
however, as a general rule, discriminating between
objects becomes more difficult as the magnitude of the difference decreases. The difficulty is illustrated in research examining twodimensional
figures with the same area. When consumers compare the size of two shapes
(e.g., a rectangle and a circle of the same area), they make systematic errors.
<br><br>
You can be sure that those studying (and producing) the "funny shapes" take advantage of that.
<br><br>
Consumers judge the area of a shape by
comparing across the most salient linear dimension, <font color=blue>weighing the initial dimension more
heavily than the second dimension</font>. Differential weight leads to bias favoring whichever
shape is largest on the initial dimension.<br>
Obviously, considering additional dimensions increases the difficulty of judging
a shape�s volume compared to its area. 
<br>Further increasing the difficulty of consumers�
volume judgments is that many package shapes are purposedly irregular, with varying (deceiving) widths. 
<br>Once more, the classic Coke bottle�s hourglass shape complicates the assessment of even its
mean width. 
<br>Given that humans have developed a variety of shortcuts to conserve
mental effort in decision making, they are likely to simplify such volume judgments. <font color=blue>And the trap snaps</font>.
<br><br>
Slaves use the height of the container 
or its elongation to simplify volume judgments. A container�s height predicts volume
judgments better than or about as well as models that included width or depth
measurements. <font color=blue>When containers are tall or elongated, they are perceived as having more
of a product than those that are shorter or squat in shape</font> (perfumes and in general bottles come to mind).
<br><br>
The effects of shapes on area perceptions have been widely investigated. For instance, it
has been shown that triangles are perceived to be larger than squares, squares larger than circles, and elongated objects larger than less
elongated objects.  Elongation influences
people in natural field settings, for instance when they pour their own beverages.
The elongation of an empty glass positively
influences the perceived capacity of that glass. Likewise, 
the elongation of a pre-poured drink inside glasses (versus the elongation of glasses itself)
positively influences the perceived volume of that pre-poured drink. In a multiple-serving
context,  elongated, pre-poured drinks positively influence the actual
consumption volume while negatively influencing the perceived consumption volume.
The rationale for this is that the elongation creates high volume expectations, which are
not met by the consumption experience. Because participants are dissatisfied with the volume of
the drinks they receive, they respond by drinking additional glasses.
<br>
In fact, both children and adults pour and consume more juice when given a short, wide glass compared to
those given a tall, narrow glass, <font color=blue>but they perceive the opposite to be true</font>.
<br><br>
The tendency to overestimate the vertical
dimension is the basis of many deceiving tricks: humans have a propensity to mistakenly perceive a greater
volume in a tall, slender container. Slavemasters take advantage of this to push consumistic patterns.
Note that these differences in perceived volume <font color=blue>hover around 25%</font> and are therefore, while totally 
unrelated with the real amount of the product being sold, still quite significant 
in order to trick the slaves. Of course, knowing this, you could take advantage of such matters yourself: the next time a bartender mixes for you 
a martini-wodka, tell him to use a short, wide 
"tumbler" glass instead of a tall, slender "highball" glass:  he will probably overpour&nbsp;:-)
<br><br>
As a rule of thumb, therefore, <font color=blue>THE MORE REGULAR and less elongated is the shape of a given  product, 
THE LESS DECEIVING IT PROBABLY IS</font>. 
A cylinder can of drinking 
stuff   (beer, juice) 
is -usually- less 'deceiving' than an hourglass bottle. A regular rectangular box less deceiving than -say- a pyramidal one.
<br><br>
There are exceptions, of course. Those thin elegant cylinders, elongated on their height axis, probably contain far 
less liquid than your eyes would believe.
<br><br>
We can immediatly pull a corollary law: <font color=blue>the more 'funny' the shape, the more money makes the slavemaster</font>&nbsp;:-)
<br><br>In fact volumetric deceiving works hand in hand with 'strangeness' of the form.<br>
A classical example of the importance of 'strangeness' (added to volumetric deceiving) is given by those funny (and incredibly exepensive) 
blue mineral water bottles. Here the 'funny shape' and the 'funny color' add deceiving synergy against the poor slave.<br>
In fact in a context of  familiar
objects, novel stimuli usually capture attention rapidly and automatically. Unusual containers not only 
attract  attention more than their 'usual' counterparts, but <font color=blue>will be perceived as having a greater volume</font>.
<br><br>
As a rule of thumb, therefore, <font color=blue>THE MORE UNUSUAL THE SHAPE (or color) of a given  product, THE MORE DECEIVING IT PROBABLY IS</font>.
<br><br>
In fact slaves judge the containers that capture more attention or "looks" bigger, to be larger, even
when the "usual" container is actually bigger. 

<br><br>
The volume / novelty bias influences purchase decisions because
people believe that the container that attracts attention or "looks" bigger 
is <font color=blue>a better buy</font> than a container that
is the same size but either attracts less attention or "looks" smaller.

<br><br>
Obvious hu? Yep, <font color=blue>afterwards</font>&nbsp;:-)
