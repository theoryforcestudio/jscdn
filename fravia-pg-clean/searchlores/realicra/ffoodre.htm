Know the shit you eat, or FAST FOODs!!
<br></H3></center><hr>
Okay, you already know it: Fast Food is shit for you.
Then why millions of people still use to eat there?
Many reasons, my
friends.<br>
First of all, fast foods are, as the name says, fast:
people with a
short lunch break, who work far away from home go to a
fast food to
have their poor lunch before going back to their poor,
stressing job.<br>
Hey, ever wondered why F\Fs are fast? How comes that
nobody stays there
for a long time? Think about any fast food you have in
your town: it
could be McDonalds, Burger King, Burghy or any other:
what are the main
(only ;-) colours you find there inside? Easy one:
yellows, red . . .<bR>
Why? Because they are hot, exciting colours: you'll
never find a "blue
& green" F\F. This makes it almost impossible to relax,
i.e. to take
your time.<br>
Then, you have to seat, and that's point two. In fact
the seats in F\Fs
are *always* uncomfortable. In this way, you will soon
feel a desire to
go away, and *that's what they want*.
Hey, what are you telling to me? they want you to *go
away*? Sure
thing, my friend, as usually you will only buy once,
when you get
inside the F\F.  All the time you spend at the table is
a taken seat
with no profit.<br>
So, you buy only once... and here we come to the
"menus": they offer
you for a "cheap" price, say cheese burger, chips and
large coke, and
you gonna buy 'em. But what if all you wanted was a
plain burger, no
chips and a small coke? Well, ok, it's cheap, i'm
hungry, 'cheese
burger deluxe' menu'll be okay. F\F are also very
cheap. . . that's for
two main reasons: first is that they don't need to pay
many employees:
you have to throw your garbage away by yourself,
automatic kitchens
cook the food and one cashier can serve many people.
Second is that
food is junk: the meat they use is slaughter's refuse;
they'll tell you
"Hey, have this nice burger: it's 100% beef!! Aren't we
great ? ? ?"<br>
Bullshit. It is true it is pure beef, but my question
is: "which parts
of the beef are used?", chips are out of potatoes
frozen in the
subcontinents and refryed in palm oil before use. And
this takes me to
the food.<br>
Ever tryed to have a cheeseburger in Malta's
McDonald's, one in Rome's,
one in Gatwick airport's in London and one in
S.Francisco's? They just
taste all the same: they have studied cooking times,
studied, exclusive
ketchup recepies, studied way to put stuff in the
burger. They want it
to be soft: people don't like to chew, they want it
juicy: it feels
like mouth filling, they want it sweet (it's true:
taste one, and
you'll see ;-), 'cause people like sweet taste more
than all the
others. They taste all the same, also because in this
way, the
foreigner will feel familiar with McDon, BurgKing or
anything it is,
where ever he is.<br><bR>
 By the way, note that burger's meat is only about 19%
fat. That's not
because they care for your health, but because when you
cook a burger,
fat melts and drains, and if fat is a consistent part
of the whole
burger, the burger itself reduces its size and it
doesn't look like a
big juicy burger, bigger than the bread.
About coke (or pepsi, same crap), books could be
written. Just a few
things about it.
Coke is a 'plastic' drink: it is basically water,
sugar, caffeine,
artificial flavours (in some countries, you could find
'natural
flavours' just 'cause they *imitate* (sic!) naturale
flavours, the way
artificial vanilline imitates real, natural vanilla).
BTW, it was
invented as a remedy for headaches.
Coke will  just leave thirstier than you were, *ready
to consume
again*. That's because you'll find hortophosphoric acid
in it. This
acid will dry up your mouth almost immediatly.
Coke is not actually dangerous for its acidity, though.
It is true (i
tried it) that it dissolves coins (well, actually only
the very
external layer), but it will not harm a human stomach,
as in our
stomach is a lot of very more powerful acid, used to
digest food you
eat.
<br><br>
So, are you one of the (wo)men who work faraway and
"have to go" to
MacDonalds? Why don't you try to take with yourself a
sandwich and/or
some fruit ? Or you could do as a friend of mine,
kayaker, does: a
thermos full of vegetable soup milk and chocolate and a
piece of bread
to soak in the soup or some cookies to dive in the milk
& chocolate (or
milk and coffee).
