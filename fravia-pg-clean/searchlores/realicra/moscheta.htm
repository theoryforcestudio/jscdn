<font size=+1>...a fine little essay&nbsp;:-.) 
<br>It would be nice to open a "reversing secret codes" specific section... 
in fact there are plenty of codes to 
reverse, as ole +ORC pointed out eons ago: "<i>All around us grows a world of codes and secret and not so
secret patterns. Codes that are at times so familiar and common
that we do not even notice them any more... and yet they are
there to fool us, and yet they offer marvellous cracking
possibilities</i>".<br>
Granted, the example below is just a modest "historical reversing" attempt:  
as you will see, a faked beauty spot had, three centuries ago,  
a quasi-"steganographical" meaning: hiding a direct (sexual) message.<br>
Yet this again demonstrates 
how many things around us can have, or can have had, an interesting (and in this case slightly arousing) 
hidden meaning.

<b><u>Introduction</u></u></b><br>
This is a very short "reversing" essay. Applied to a "secret" (sort of) code 
that doesn't exist anymore. <font color="blue">Faked beauty spots</font> were all 
the rage three centuries ago, and gave a very provoking allure to the 
young (and old) ladies (and men) that did wear them.<br>
<br><b><u>Terminology</u></u></b><br>
The latin correct term is "nevus" (if we speak of the common melanocytic nevi). 
Yhe terms used in English are "mole" and "beauty spot", while in French we speak of a  
"grain de beauté" (grain of beauty), in Spanish the term is "lunar" (the sign of the moon), 
in italian "neo", in german "Schönheitsfleck" (dutch "schoonheidsvlekje", swedish "skönhetsfläck") and 
in portuguese "sinal". 
<br>
<br><b><u>Mode & trends</u></u></b><br>Faked "beauty spots" must have been great fun because of their "secret" meanings: put a fake mole 
on your nose and be a shameless <i>provocateur</i>.<br><br> 
You can find traces of this usage all over Europe: 
In Venice there is a famous "Calle delle moschete" where these faked beauty spots were produced.<br>
The venetian word "moschete" (literally "small flies"), refers to 
these small faked moles, that were made of taffeta 
(a lustrous plain weave fabric with a smooth feel and slightly ribbed appearance) and 
were produced in this venetian street
for the charming (and rather sexually open) ladies of the XVIII century. 
<br><br>

This mode  has disappeared, but I bet that anyone that would care to 
reintroduce such customs could make millions&nbsp;:-)
<br>
So, in order to avoid any excessive commercial exploit, I declare all kind of fake beauty spots (the moschete)
 that -given their age- are not <i>per se</i> subjected to copyright, to be henceforth
protected forever under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GPL license</a>: anyone 
is granted the right to produce, sell, use moschete as much as he cares 
only PROVIDED he respects the spirit and letter of the GPL license. There, I said it.
<br><br>
<b><u>Bibliography</u></b><br>For Venice refer to the fantastic 
work of Giuseppe Tassini (1827-1899): 
<i>Curiosit&agrave; veneziane, ovvero origini delle denominazioni stradali</i>, 
(Venezia 1863), that nowadays many young thiefs continue  to exploit and shamelessly rip off 
in order to sell 
rather ludicrous "second tier" books about the "magic" Venice.
 <br><br>
For Spain refer instead to 
Luis Jos&eacute; Vel&aacute;zquez (Marquis of Valdeflores) 
beautiful small book: <i>Collecci&oacute;n de diferentes escritos relativos al cortejo</i> (Madrid, 1764) 
where you will be able to read the following about the "steganographic" implicit messages of the moschete:<bR> 
"<i>The beauty spots on the left temple may signify that the fortress is occupied; 
on the right temple, that she is on the point of breaking up with the current escort and 
ready to choose another; and the absence of the beauty spots on either 
temple may mean that the place is vacant. The tiny patches, skillfully distributed throughout 
the face, may denote a momentary state of mind of the lady. For instance, 
placed near the right eye, they command the cortejo not to 
look so attentively at someone; placed in the vicinity of the left eye, 
that he can look at whomever he wishes. A spot near the right-hand corner 
of the mouth should signal to him not to talk to such and such a person; 
near the left-hand corner will tell the escort that he had been very amusing and cute</i>".

<br><b><u>Where & who</u></u></b><br
The "moschete" were proudly "worn" by the ladies of the epoque on 
faces and breasts. The shapes could vary from the more "classic" round circle to a small star or a small heart 
and even to a small 
crescent (which was still "politically sensitive" in those times: the moresque "luna" was   
the symbol of the historical enemy and exactly for this reason it was probably 
also 
considered provocative and arousing. Nowadays the powers that be have again imposed 
the crescent as symbol 
of the enemy. I wonder if a faked, crescent-shaped, beauty spot wouldn't be rather more arousing than a burka.
<br>
 Beauty spots had a specific meaning, which 
depended on their location on the skin.  
<br><bR>
Here Giuseppe Tassini's description:
<br>
Near the mouth they meant 
voluptuousness. There were TWO possible 
areas: close to the underlips, in which case the mosquete were called <b>civette</b> (literally owl, but in italian 
it means also "One given to flirting", i.e: coquette) and close to the corners of the mouth, 
in which case the moschete were called <b>assassine</b> literally: 
"able to kill". <br><br>
On the
throat (or on the cheek) they conveyed a meaning of gallantry. This type of moscheta was in fact called
<b>galante</b> i.e.: gallant or <b>tirabaci</b> i.e.: lovelock. On the nose a faked beauty spot 
shows boldness and was called <b>sfrontata</b>, i.e.: shameless).<br> 
A moscheta on the eye-corner  indicates passion: <b>appassionata</b> (i.e.: passionate). This should not 
 be confused with the <b>irresistibile</b>, that was always located  
 near one of the eyes.<br>
In the middle of the forehead the beauty spot meant grandeur (and
was called  <b>maestosa</b>, i.e.: grand). </td> <td width= 3%>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td>

<br>
In France there were similar significations for les grains de beauté (aka "les mouches"):
<br>
"<i>La mouche était également un faux grain de beauté, fait de mousseline noire et collé sur le visage, 
utilisé pour faire ressortir la blancheur du teint. L'usage des mouches 
était déjà connu au XVIIème siècle. C'est au XVIIIème siècle qu'elles vont devenir 
les symboles de la parure. 
<br>
La localisation de la mouche sur le visage possédait une symbolique particulière qui 
donnait des précisions sur le tempérament et la personnalité 
de l'utilisatrice à un moment donné.</i>"
