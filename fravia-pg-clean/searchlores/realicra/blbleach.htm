Ok, you observe a phenomenon, the first reaction is to ridicule it. But you soon notice 
that there are powerful forces behind it. And knowing how to search you can throw some 
light in the lairs of the dark spiders, the scary caves 
where the muffled sounds of advertisement can be heard and  
where the 
commercial vermine happily prays on the 
stupid slaves' behaviour...

De rerum natura
</b><br>
<i>I want to point out that I am NOT an expert in this "Fashion-semanthic" field, 
and that -therefore- I count on 
my readers' savyness (and their future contributions) to ameliorate the 
following short considerations.<br>But I am 
getting  more and more convinced that people are very often being  
tricked into paying horrific sums for <u>less</u>
quality, whereas with a little discerning knowledge (and/or searching ability) anyone 
can have <u>BETTER</u> objects (gadgets or non gadgets, this is irrelevant) in terms of 
quality, duration, value and enjoyement potential. And that you can have 
these better choices <u>for next to nothing</u>, compared to the 'frill 
penalty' you would have to pay 
for  any of the advertised lures.<br>  
This I have found true for many items: watches, wines, apartments, books, 
cars, software, yachts, 
<a href="slaves.htm">food products</a>, computers, 
<a href="hp_slobo.htm">printers</a> and so on.
<br><br>This said, 
 I believe that you will find among <u>clothes</u> (more generally among fashion items)
some of the most easy to reverse scams: just 
think of all the zombies around you, proudly trodding along 'wearing' on their clothes 
some 
advertisement (in big letters or under the form of a logo): 
sandwich men that <u>paid</u> for this dubious 'honor'.<br> 
That's nothing. Among <font color=blue>blue jeans</font> we have - I believe - 
an even more striking  example, that we'll examine today.  
<br><br>I hate
advertisers! Prostituted brains! Worse than those 'three halfshells' scam 
performers you meet 
on some dark alleys. Under the three moving cups 
you may at least believe to have
a theoretical chance to win, behind the advertisers' rutilant 
new clothes 
only void (and ridicule) awaits you.

Stonewashed mon oeil
</b><br>
     'Stonewashed' or aesthetic bleached' jeans are
"faded before you bought 'em". And according to the 
commercial beasts that manage to sell such weared-off' jeans to the young slaves, 
"you do not wear a jeans, you wear a Levi's attitude".  
    <br>
It should be noted <i>en passant</i> that 
these very jeans are of course everything but really 'stonewashed' (you don't think
they still would use real pumice stones nowadays, do you?). 
<br>No. They use enzymes that 'just' damage the textile 
threads, they use sprayed "sand jets", that weaken the texture, they use 
ceramic balls friction in order to 
'wear off' quickly the denim tissue.<br> 
The only "guaranteed" added advantage 
of such a procedure is that the resultant "stonewashed" 
products 
will have for sure 
a shorter usable-life... not surprisingly, having been weared off  on purpose in order 
to deliver the promised "attitude". 
<br>
So they are selling to the
young consumer slaves  an <i>eo ipso</i> <u>inferior product</u> for  <u>a superior</u> 
price.<br> 
Woha! The secret nasty dream of every 
second hand car seller came true! Sort of a "<font color=blue>science fiction reality</font>": 
evil aliens from reptil planet are selling - with wicked 
gusto and malignous purpose - 
damaged non working products to a zombified human race!

Wabi, Sabi and Levis' jeans
</b><br>

Now we all know that there's a (sound) zen attitude towards 'weared' and 
consumed object. According to the zen culture, objects must have 
some <font color=blue>wabi</font>: the controlled haphazard. Rice or tea bowls out 
of shape, for instance, with cracks, blows and ashes in the glaze, 
invite us to partake of the process of creation trough theit asimmetry and imperfection. 
 "Wabi" is not only beauty, but 
also restraint and moderation.<br>Clearly this is not the case here. 
Even in the west, the  <u>real</u> prerequisite of any 'consumed beauty', in a piece of 
furniture, in a jewel or in a boat, is that the object was consumed by  
use and/or by  time. Not by scam. 
<br>
Nobody in his right mind would ever come to the idea of 
purposedly wearing an object <u>in order to</u> acquire a 'weared' look, 
unless... unless -as it is the case here- 
you are a scammer, keen into deceiving people.
         <br>
In that case the better the scam, the more useful it will be 
for the success of your deceiving
 purposes: new furniture -for instance-  has to 'look' old for the 
idiots that do not understand a zilch; copies of paintings that are not real,  
but have to deceive some ignorant buyer, should look 'fatigued'; 
supposedly old 'tin toys', at the local flea 
markt, come mostly straight out of some Taiwanese fabric, with battered paint and 
all; faked banknotes should not -of course- look new... and so on.<br> 
<br>There is a zen exception, though:   <font color=blue>sabi</font>.<br>
The more advanced zen concept of sabi:  "making a piece look old" 
is driven by a fascinating philosophy: 
there is no need to "wear the new off" in order to give them character: 
the objects are 
already mellow and unpretentious. The potter has created the <i>sense</i> of wear, which is a quality considerably 
more difficult to realize than any aura of newness.<br> So far so good, Levis commercial 
minions could use these very words to defend their stonewashed zombies' pride.<br>
Yet the <u>MOST IMPORTANT POINT</u> in the context of sabi unpretentious 
objects, 
is that the potter, the producer, WANTS the zen conoisseur to understand what he 
has done: to see the clay, to feel and admire its texture, to appreciate the reasons for the 
type and color of the glaze. He wants the buyer to gain MORE knowledge, not less! 
It is a deliberate aesthetic device, reminding one 
that the potter is an individual artist, not a faceless craftsman.
<br>
With our "Stonewashed Levis jeans" example 
the sabi approach <u>is commercially perverted</u>. The wicked purpose is here 
the exact CONTRARY: you 
want buyers to be uninformed, faceless zombies, all wearing the SAME faked object, all 
paying -happily-
more money in order to get less quality, subsconsciuosly KNOWING IT.  
<br>Of course in order to get this effect you have to stonewash a little their brains 
(should "stonewashed" jeans buyers really possess similar devices in their skulls&nbsp;:-)
<br>
As you can see watching Levis' advertisements, they 
deceive their own buyers with gusto, moreover there is at times even a cheap, evil, 
quite evident sarcasm: for instance in this french advertisement "<font color=blue>Usés aux genoux 
et aux fesses, effilochés en bas et à la taille, vous êtes dans la 
peau d'un autre et qui sait, si vous deveniez quel-qu'un que vous étiez?</font>".
<br><br>
Deceivers have ALWAYS enjoyed faking antiquity for commercial purposes. Yet, usually,  
they have been very careful NOT to let people understand the trick. Else even 
average ignorants would never have fallen for it.<br>
Levis does the contrary, and preys on (and prays for&nbsp;:-) the stupidity of the young zombies. For 
these little slaves, that have slurped almost exclusively 
TV-commercials since their little eyes went open, 
frills and appearence are EVERYTHING, and 
substance and content mean nothing. They have been created and educated in order to 
consume. And they will die consuming.<br>
The incredible aspect of the stonewashed scam 
is that it bases on the happy acquiescience of the victims. Translated it means: 
"Hey bozo! Please 
pay me MORE to give you a product that will for sure have LESS quality, guaranteed!".<br>
In fact the little zombies would not even WANT a pair of solide new jeans, 
not even in order to wear them out, eventually,  
with the necesary time and real life experience that is needed to wear things out.  
They seem generally to dislike any 'reality' intruding into their TV-conditioned 
lifes.
<br>
<br>They just want "the look": they desperately want to look 
like anybody 
else. It definitely does NOT look like they would want to be seen as "<font color=blue>individuals</font>": 
a real "individual" (a species in danger of disappearing nowadays) 
would buy the most 
solid jeans on sale,  
even Levis if tough enough, why not? He would check their quality thoroughly - he would 
know how to check it - and once satisfied he would  
tear off any etiquette on sight.<br> Finally what slaves kept in captivity since many generations 
really 
love the most is to OBEY, not to rebel: they are conditioned to do, buy, read and believe 
whatever some evil commercial mind tells them 
to do, buy, read and believe.<br> 
Like guinea pigs answering with salivation an electric shock for the 100th time, they 
are so conditioned that they would not even understand <u>how</u> to question 
their pavlovian behaviour.<br>They will probably make good cannon fodder for the powers that 
be... 
I doubt you could use 
them anyway for anything else, with or without their "stonewashed" attitude.
<br><br>
Note that blue jeans are a sociological phenomenon <i>per se</i> and should 
represent -theoretically- 
one of the 
few 'democratic' pieces of clothing, that both princes and unenployed (not to mention 
unemployed princes&nbsp;:-) can theoretically wear in any occasion. 
In fact blue jeans are (or rather should be) 
actually 'proto-fashion' articles: their position being at the opposite 
of the extremely unwearable "haute-couture", a sector where 
affluent zombies are lured into paying huge quality-unrelated sums for a particular 
"name" that should automagically justify 
the extra price.<br> Once more what plays a role is not <u>the quality</u> 
 but <u>the frills</u>. Yet there is  
 a difference: The economic divide! Both categories are thoroughly scammed, of course, 
but scamming poor people is as easy
as shooting the red cross: poor zombies are more 
easily transformed in sandwich men and 
tricked into wearing their masters' names tatooed in big letters  
onto themselves, whereas a slightly more subtle approach is necessary 
for richer zombies:  "It's so expensive you cannot go wrong: have an Armani suit, 
mylord"&nbsp;:-)
 <br>
<br><b>
Reversing codes   and other snippets
</b><br>   
Levis can retail for up to $200.00 a
     pair of vintage looking 501 in Japan and nearly 
that much in parts of Europe where supply
     is held scarce. Note that the same jeans are sold in the States 
for <a target=_top href="http://www.inbluejeans.com/levis.htm">$40-70</a>.
<br>
Hence it is quite clear that the company is artificially
     restricting supply by limiting sales to authorized retailers.
<br> <br>
     Every pair of Levis jeans has many codes and hidden markers that
     identify the year and a lot more to an expert. For example, even
     the tiny red tag on the back right pocket can tell you something.
     If the "E" in Levis is CAPITALIZED, that means the jeans were made
     prior to 1971 and could be "worth"  hundreds of dollars. Not because 
of the quality, because of the induced fashion. Such a situation 
is  saddening to say the least: maybe 
we should simply take advantage of the zombies ourselves, faking these easy to 
reverse codes&nbsp;:-(
<br>
   <hr width=44%>  

<br>   'Stonewashed' jeans fulfill the slaves' desire of 'looking like the advertisement dolls' 
 (peer pressure will also guarantee that they will look 
exactly like their classroom companions). The clothes will
 "look" stressed out, nicely worn for "the right reasons", without 
the actual experience of being buffeted by  circumstances beyond the young slave's control.
<br>There is a last economical peculiarity here: 
Generally, in markets where the per capita income is low, 
it is advisable to simplify the product, or sell it in smaller 
unit quantities (eg toothpaste or disposable razors), to reduce 
the sales price. However, for some products, like Levis jeans, low 
per capita income affects neither the demand nor the sales price.
<br>Looks like the quadrature of the circle for stonewashed jeans resellers, duh.

Conclusion
</b><br><table><tr><td><font size=+1>   
Consuming Society  depends 
on an uninterrupted supply of new consumers. The sons of men who worked to buy $7 
Levis (and make the manufacturer of Levis rich), must now work to buy $70 (in Europe and Japan much more) 
Levis for 
their sons (and make the sons of Levis even richer). In the intervening time, however, 
something has changed. The $7 Levis were an excellent value because as "workpants" they 
met a need, 
protection from the elements and the abrasion of physical labor, and taking account of 
inflation 
would sell today for about 3 times as much. In fact, that's about what the current 
version of the old model sells for. The $70 (in Europe and Japan much more) "stonewashed" Levis are not as durable, 
so what is 
it that gives them their value? The answer is "status", the status of un-needed 
consumption in a context of ignorance. The difference in price is due to the fact that "fools" cannot see 
the real value of objects trough the advertisement fog, and thus will not pay for value, 
but -like Andersen's famous emperor- for whatever they are told they should see.    
<br>
Sadly it is the children who are the most taken in, and consider 
such things important. Having been thoroughly stripped of any sense of their 
own intrinsic worth, substituted with a sense of values based on what is outside 
them, these young slaves have no defense against the commercial beasts that -like vultures- 
feast 
on them.
