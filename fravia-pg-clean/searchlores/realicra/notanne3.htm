                 <i>Well, I like this kind of 'cuts'. I always believed that we have 
all the time we need to do whatever we need. I don't believe in the 
'not having the time' excuse. Is there something you like? Feeling the winds? 
Looking at amoebas through a microscope? Writing a poem? Watching a Landscape? 
Just do it. Take all the time you need. Throw away your watch and your GSM, 
both are just evident (moral and physical) slavery symbols. Feel 
the time of the day with your skin: reverse the days. 
You'll never regret it.<br>Of course if you are serious you shouldn't tackle time 
problems without your "Grotefend"... Hermann Grotefend wrote in 1891 his 'Taschenbuch der 
Zeitrechnung des deutschen mittelalters und der Neuzeit... and its fifth edition (the 1922's one) 
has been reprinted a zillion 
times. Don't miss that fundamental book if you want to understand what a 'saltus lunae' and 
what a 'circulus solaris' are... I even wrote a small program, long ago (on a Spectrum!), that 
allowed you to calculate and convert all dates of this world based on Grotefend's splendid tables and 
work.</i>

                 <p>Hello Fravia+,</p>

                 <p>I was inspired today by IcE's neato essay on reality cracking to
                 rewrite and update a little essay I wrote last year about the
                 year 2K thingy everyone seems to be so excited about.  I took out most
                 of the Y2K rhetoric and tried to focus more on the perceptions of time
                 and reality cracking.</p>

                 <p><b>Assuming</b> that something good or bad will happen at the turn
                 of this
                 upcoming century is an odd thought. Two thousand is just a number like
                 any other, like eleven, fifty-three or million-six. If you believe in
                 linear time then every year, day, hour, etc. is unique, different, and
                 potentially a threat to human and animal kind--or not. The Earth
                 doesn't know what year it is, what day it is or what hour it is. The
                 Earth speeds it’s way around the Sun completely unaware as to what we
                 silly humans are doing (or measuring for that matter.) Nothing bad has
                 ever happened exactly at 12 midnight, January 1st in the year 1 or 100
                 or 1000, and thinking that anything other than "normal" life will
                 continue is a matter of perception, human perception. My watch says
                 it's 9 PM, but yours says it's 6 AM. Go figure.</p>

                 <p><b>Human</b> ways of measuring time (calendars and the like) change
                 every so
                 often. We’re fickle. What we believe to be the beginning of a new
                 century today may be perceived as the middle of another century in the
                 future. For example, Jewish and Chinese culture do not agree with us
                 misguided euroamerican westerners as to what year it really is. Is it
                 year number 2000 or is it 5700? I don’t know for sure, but my paycheck
                 from the man says it’s 1998, so it's got to be right, right?</p>

                 <p><b>The</b> Christian Bible (no, I’m not a religious nut, this is
                 just an
                 example so get over it) states that the Earth and everything on it was
                 created in six "days" (on the seventh day, God took a day off) a few
                 thousand (or whatever) years ago. Let's say just for a moment that this
                 is true. Was the calendar as we know it today (12 months, 7-day weeks,
                 365 days, etc.) in use at the time that was written? Nope! So assuming
                 that one "day" back then is the same 24 hours we know and love today is
                 silly, when you also know for a fact that the Earth's own happy
                 rotation is slowing down, making the "days" "weeks" and "years"
                 constantly longer than before, and this has been going on since way
                 before the beginning of human timekeeping. We are measuring the same
                 thing (we hope), time, but are constantly altering our perception of
                 it. Think of how often you have to change the time on your wristwatch.
                 Do you adjust the time every so often? I thought so. See? Even you're
                 doing it!!</p>

                 <p><b>Every</b> year or so timekeeping scientists must adjust our
                 conception of
                 time in order to keep us on an even, precise calendar, so that we don’t
                 miss that important meeting or sports game on the telly. Leap year is a
                 good example of this. Every four years, we add a day onto February so
                 as to make sure that 1/4 day we gain every year is taken into account.
                 I find it odd that seventeen whole days was permanently removed from
                 our western calendar a few centuries ago because of this leap year
                 thingy, as if they never existed. Lamers, can’t they get it right the
                 first time? Guess not. Let’s change it again! A few seconds added or
                 subtracted here and there are seemingly insignificant, but as you
                 calculate the minutes and hours as compared to the number of years that
                 we have been keeping time, the added days and weeks can throw off your
                 whole conception of time, history, life, and when you think last year
                 was.</p>

                 <p><b>Time</b> is relative. See a trend in this essay? Human evolution,
                 what IcE
                 calls "reality conditioning" has defined our perception, because we
                 have learned and think we know how to measure this thing we call time.
                 There are advanced ways of timekeeping that we puny little humans, with
                 our written calendars, watches and other devices, neglect to
                 acknowledge, that wonderful thing we call "biological time." IcE asked,
                 "do animals wear Rolex’s? In a way." I say with no small emphasis that
                 whales, butterflies and geese keep time. Not the way we do with
                 machines or other technologies, but with their internal biological
                 clocks. They all seem to happily migrate and travel places "right on
                 time" year after year after year without the use of written language or
                 calendars. What’s up with that? How can animals be so precise without
                 the aid of technology? Don't we need technology in order to function
                 properly in proper human society? Bah! We humans are handicapped by our
                 material conditioning (our consumerism upbringing) with all this stuff
                 we rely on to simply function on a day to day basis, as animals are
                 precisely unencumbered by this stuff, and still do the same job of
                 functioning just fine without it. How can I keep my little job working
                 for the man if I don't have my alarm clock to wake me up every morning?
                 The Sun?  What's that?  You mean the Sun can wake me up in the morning
                 with mere light?  Scary!  Animals do use technology, so don’t think we
                 made tools and the like first. Birds modify sticks to catch beetles
                 underground, monkeys make beds and wash their food with leaves, and
                 even ants have agriculture and use tools that we’ve only been making
                 and using for a few thousand years...they have been using them for
                 millions of years...but I digress.</p>

                 <p><b>Are</b> we humans so different from animals (most assume that
                 it's the
                 animals that are the "primitive" ones) because they can't keep our
                 concept of time, read or write any human language? I think it is we who
                 are primitive because we, in all our supposed wisdom of the world
                 around us haven't been able to figure out how geese or wildebeest
                 migrate, or even decipher even one animal language. I can teach my dog
                 to learn, react and respond to German and English words and phrases,
                 but I cannot speak or understand my dog’s language of woofs, barks and
                 whines. I think my dog is more advanced than I in many ways, for he
                 knows very well the cross-species human words "cheese" "walkies" and
                 "TV" but I have no idea what the dog word "woof" means.  I might know
                 he was barking at a cat, but I don’t know what exactly Big Jim was
                 saying in dog words. "Look, it's the neighbor's cat, and she has
                 kittens, and they look yummy!" I’m illiterate when it comes to
                 dogspeak. No matter how hard I try, I just can't understand "woof."</p>

                 <p><b>Perhaps</b> animals already understand us and our calendars,
                 languages, and
                 computers, and choose not to partake in our silly materialism. Perhaps
                 it is the animals with the true wisdom on this planet, and have the
                 biological technology to not need useless crap to keep track of things.
                 Maybe, just maybe "wetware" is the answer to all the questions we try
                 so hard to solve with machines.</p>

                 <p><b>Time</b> is what you perceive it to be. Make the most of it in
                 your own
                 way, or it will overcome you and take over your life, becoming the
                 focus instead of the instrument for something more important:
                 living.</p>
