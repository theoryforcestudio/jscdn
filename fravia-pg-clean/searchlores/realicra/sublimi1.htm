Felipe's 3 examples of subliminals<br>(and a small Coke's 
<a href="sublimi1.htm#addit">addition</a> by Bomber Monkey)</h2>
25 November 1998<bR>

<p>
Here I send you 3 examples of subliminals, I expect to help your
lifes and to help to "disenslave" you . Please notice that the first one
is just information I collected on internet, but the other two were
discovered through my own observation..</center><hR><br>

1-Windows' logo subliminals
<bR><br>

The Dark Horse<bR>
The one that most people can see right off the bat is the silhouette of
a dark horse rearing up on the left
side of the Windows 95 logo. If you have the Plus pack CD-ROM, you'll
find this image on that disc
as a file called LOGO.SYS (which, despite its name, is simply a
bitmapped image that can be loaded
and viewed in Paint. Set the horizontal scale to 170% for a proper
aspect ratio.); otherwise, simply
restart Windows 95 to view the title screen.
As further evidence of the horse's existence, a completely different
image of a galloping horse appears
in approximately the same position on the Win95.bmp image (its tail and
rear leg are at the left edge of
the screen; its head is inside the blue rectangle). Coincidence? I
think not. The meaning(s) of this image
are open to interpretation, but the powerful image of a stallion, the
phrase "dark horse" and other studly
associations are all well-known symbols. 
<bR><br>
Freedom<bR>
While you're looking at the Win95.bmp image, it's worth noting that
there appears to be a large, dark
bird with outstretched wings above and to the right of the logo. Flying
and freedom, we presume, are
the messages here. Or is that a vulture?<bR><br> 
The Rock Hero<bR>
On the right side of the logo, there is an image that, in one concise
image, manages to conjure up
suggestions of the passion and excitement of rock music, death and
drugs -- all powerful and typical
subliminal images. If you imagine that the upper-right corner of the
Windows logo points to the back of
a guitarist's neck, you can see that the guitarist has curly hair, a
mustache, a clearly visible frilly collar,
and is playing with his head back and his elbow at approximately the
area where the green and the
yellow rectangles meet. With a little more effort, it's not hard to
imagine that this afro-haired,
mustachioed guitar hero could be none other than Seattle-area rock
legend, Jimi Hendrix. The fact that
he's a local (dead) hero only adds to the plausibility of the
rock-hero-tribute theory. Or could "rocking"
and "horse" be related? 
<bR><br>
Subliminal Sex<bR>
Not convinced about that one, eh? Well, if you're not so sure that the
Microsoft folks would put a
tribute to a local success story in their code, may we direct your
attention to the image of a well-known
logo on the coffee cup in the animated icon file "SBUX.ANI"). 
The largest hidden image is the most obvious and potent symbol of the
bunch. Like all good subliminal
messages (especially those that have already been shown to contain
references to power, drugs and
rock and roll), this one is about SEX. Look above the Win95 logo and
imagine that the blue area
behind it is the left profile of a man's head. Above the upper-left
corner of the logo is the man's cheek
and eye, defined by a dark area about an inch above the upper-left
corner of the logo. Just to the right
of the white bump in the clouds would, of course, be the point where
the forehead and nose meet. His
forehead and hair are defined by the white clouds at the very top of
the screen. At the top-center of the
screen is his sideburn, and to the right of that, his ear. His chin,
therefore, would be at about the point
on-screen between the large red rectangle and the two smaller ones. 
Naturally, this male figure is poised in a classic missionary position
over the figure of a female figure,
her head back (her neck extends from the bottom-left of the logo
through the letter "s" of "Microsoft").
She appears to be laying on a pillow, her "Princess Leia" hair defined
by the white area at the center of
the left edge of the screen. The bridge of her nose, therefore, is seen
from above and to the right of her
head; the bottom of her chin is approximately where the black dots
between the blue and the red areas
of the logo are. That would make the large bump on the right side of
the logo her...well, you figure it
out.<bR>
 The wallpaper file, CLOUDS.BMP has an even more obvious female image
with the light area just
above the center of the screen showing a blonde woman with puckered
lips pressed directly up against
those of a -- omigod! -- a black man! Hmmm. Do you detect a striking
resemblance to...? Naw, it
couldn't be. Could it?<bR>
There's another obvious face in CLOUDS.BMP, too. Look just to the right
of center-screen and you'll
see a man's face, with the eyes and nose in heavy shadow. If you can't
see it, try reducing the
brightness and/or upping the contrast of your screen.

2- SPEED 2 Incentivating sex with children (I don´t know the exact name
in English)
<bR><br>
You must be questioning yourselfs why the hack they would do it. I
don´t know, but I´m sure they did it.
<bR><br>
First of all there is the mute girl that comunicates with the good guy
and shows interest on him. After that she  appears on scenes showing
too much of their body, for a girl (I´m sorry that I could watch the
movie only once, so I cant remember the scenes  very well, but I
remember that there was one in the elevator). And after that all,
Sandra Bullock (I think that was her) is watching Lolita in her T.V set.
Could you feel the conections? Isn´t it strange?
<bR><br>
I would really like if specialist could explain me why they did that.


<bR><br>
3-Tv companies using our reflexes against us
<bR><br>
Have you ever noticed that when someone yawns, you feel like yawning?
This happens because of what is called motorized empathy, an
involuntary movement that we do, copying others people movements, just
like baby smile as we do.<bR>
This same principle is used by t.v. companies. You knows that programs
when you hear laughs after each stupid joke?<br>
They do that, because it provocates motorized empathy too. What makes
us feels like laughing, because only listening to the voice activates
our brains. The recent Nobel prize Dario Fo, an italian comic/political 
(very clever) actor, had (and has :-) 
an extraordinary capacity for "passing" a laugh to his audience. Anyone that 
has seen his incredible (reversing spectacle) 'Mistero Buffo' will remember this... 
you just cannot avoid to laugh when somebody more or less in philosofical sintony with you 
(like Dario fo with us and the TV-Sitcom with the zombies :-) 'passes' us a laugh...

<hr size=2><center>Coke's Ice cubes</center><br>
The new machines that vend exclusively Coca-Cola products depict a
sexy can of Coke sitting in a bed of ice, in the most erotic way
possible.  And I am not joking.
    Look at the pieces of ice on the can.  On a glance, you see
something odd about them: on a wet, red can, the ice is white.  They
should be red.  Look closer.  The ice on top of the can strongly
resembles a voluptous woman, with her hair dangling over the rim.  The
one to the left of the "ca" in "Coca" looks like a topless woman in
jeans with a belt covering her breasts with her arms.  To the right of
the "ol" in "Cola" another piece resembles a couple making out.  The
piece to the right of the "a" looks like a mother with her child, the
piece above and to the right of that looks like a Arnie.  Above the "a"
another piece of ice seems to resemble a comtented man sitting on the
ground (most likely on a grassy hilltop).  The piece on the swirl to the
right of Coca resembles a revolver.  The ice itself contains subtle
suggestions, although they are too subtle to identify individually.
    The point of this: subconsciously, these will be noticed, and Coke
probably hopes that it will associate its product with these images,
carefully chosen so that at least one image will appeal to everyone.
    Or maybe its just me.
