<I>Granted, I'm gambling. Publishing this essay (that has been of course sent 
anonymously to me) I'm taking a gamble. I just trust that my readers are like 
me: impervious to the obvious scourges and yet fully 
open to any "sarcastical reversing", even if as "heavy" as this one...<br><bR>
Unfortuntaley I have already experienced (for minor offences :-) that many 
many readers take things way too seriously... yet I do not! And see: 
that's the only reason I'm publishing this: it's great fun, it is very well
 written (it is of course a troll, see my <a href="https://searchlores.nickifaulk.com/realicra/enemy.htm">enemy.htm</a> section, and the 
complete exegesis of the first part of this text below... 
yet who cares?, A well written troll is a troll worth reading!) and it is a 
first essay in what I hope will be my 'text cracking' section, maybe  
not as useful as our <a href="realicra.htm">reality cracking</a> 
essays in order to survive, but -I am sure- very useful in order to stalk our 
friends and enemies on the web.<bR><bR>
So let it be published (and -oh boy!- I had some serious reserves about 
this)... let's see if we have or not enough "reversing might" as not to take 
any offence from it... and let's see, above all, if we can <font color=red>use it</font> in 
order to tackle a fascinating aspect of reverse engineering that has been almost 
forgotten in the last 50 years... text-exegesis (more about this at the bottom, 
after you'll have read Gossip's text)<br>
<bR>Anyway I hope that my readers <u>did</u> read Swift's most famous 
book: 'A Modest 
proposal'... Irish undernourished parents should eat their kids, because this 
would solve at once the famine AND the overpopulation problem... written more 
than a century ago... and quite 'strong' from a surreality cracking standpoint... <bR>
Man, I love this kind of reversing (and I don't believe it is so much different from code 
reversing after all :-)<bR>Look at the introduction (technically <i>apostrophe</i>): "<font color=purple>Dear 
+HCUkers and fellow necrophiliacs</fonT>" this is 
a classical masterpiece of rethorical deceiving... Hey, hey, are you still there? Ok: 
here you go with this new "troll cracking" masterpiece  :-)

 <hR></center>
<H4>
<br><br>
Dear +HCUkers and fellow necrophiliacs,
<br><br>
After spending a significant number of hours browsing through the
kernel update of the much overbloated Win98 (now cracked and available
everywhere), I decided to relax at around one in the morning and
strolled down to the funeral home a few blocks away from my flat. After
selecting what appeared to be a normal (but freshly dead) 10- or
11-year-old girl in a rather exquisite mahogany casket, I fucked her
fishy body for approximately fifteen minutes (screaming out Bill Gates'
name just about every other minute :-) and was suddenly inspired by the
reality that most conventional protections against catching disease
from rotting flesh are ineffectual at best. (Could there be "hidden
protections"?) So, I considered the healths of my fellow HCU buddies,
including +ORC, and decided to write the following up. (HCUers, watch
out for a coming section related to corpse-humping at fravia.net!
Believe me, you haven't lived until you've had sex with as much
lubricant as you want! Going to a 
 hooker is nothing compared to this. :-)
<br><br>
-----
<br><br>
I: Introduction 
<br><br>
Very few text files have been written regarding the sexual tendencies
and practices of necrophiliacs. While most people would prefer to
believe that we do not exist we most certainly do as is obvious to
anyone who visits a cemetery during our nightly rampages. Necrophiliacs
prefer to go about their business alone; sharing is not a part of this
alternative lifestyle as the corpse usually wears out fairly quickly.
This is not to say that the occasional orgy involving four or five
necrophiliacs and about a dozen or so corpses does not occur, but it is
very rare. In this file I will describe common (and some uncommon)
techniques which necrophiliacs use to gain satisfaction from their
stiff partners. Hopefully these vivid descriptions will encourage you
to go out to your local cemetery and to join our ranks! 
<br><br>
II: Finding a partner 
<br><br>
Finding a partner for your necrophiliac activities is definitely the
hardest part. You not only have to gain access to the corpse but you
also have to find one which suits your tastes. Granted, some
necrophiliacs would screw roadkill if given the chance but most of us
are more discriminating. Your chances depend upon where you pick up
your date. If you have access to a morgue it would definitely be your
best bet as the corpses there are usually the freshest and have not yet
been treated for burial. They may be a bit chilly because they've been
lying in the meat locker for days but that really shouldn't make a big
difference to the determined necrophiliac. Cemeteries are a bit harder
to deal with as finding a screwable corpse is harder to do. However, if
you know how to interpret signs this shouldn't be a problem. If a grave
consists of a mound of fresh dirt and is covered with flowers, chances
are that the stiff hasn't been laying here for too long. Rotting
flowers on the mound usually hint to the state of the corpse as well. Some people are
exclusively into 'porking the bone', i.e. sex with skeletons. In this
case you can dig up almost any grave and hope that the inhabitant
hasn't yet disintegrated into dust. Try to scope out a fairly secluded
cemetery for your passions unless you like a sense of danger to go
along with the sex. Having anyone catch you in the act is NOT fun, and
if you're picked up by a cop chances are that you won't be able to
screw anything but Bubba behind bars for the next few decades. People
are generally not understanding of the necrophiliac lifestyle, so it
will probably be a long time before we can come out of the closet. 
<br><br>
III: Preparation 
<br><br>
Depending upon where you are at this point you'll have either a little
or a lot of work to do. The person in the morgue will obviously have to
do little more than to open the locker, pull the corpse out and bang
away. If you're one of the cemetery people you'll have more work to do.
An experienced necrophiliac is always equipped with the bare
essentials: a shovel, vaseline and a box of rubbers. Why the shovel is
needed should be obvious, but if the ground is hard then you might need
more equipment to dig up your date. Vaseline is used to loosen the
corpse up a bit. This makes it less likely for a body part to break off
while you're having fun and it also prevents your mantool from becoming
too irritated while screwing the dried out pussy. The BOX of condoms is
used to play it safe; no necrophiliac should be without it. You never
know which STDs your partner had during his/her lifetime, and believe
me, it doesn't get any better after the person dies. You can put on
more than one rubber for extra protection if it is warranted, but screwing a corpse
without protection is just plain stupid unless you want to be the next
date for a necrophiliac. If you're in a cemetery try to drag the corpse
out of the grave and behind a bush or to another secluded place.
Pumping away in the grave may seem more convenient, but it's a severe
disadvantage to you if you need to take off in a hurry. Sometimes the
corpse is too fragile to be moved; in that case make it fast. Or just
break off the head, hand or lower torso and take it with you for added
convenience. 
<br><br>
Part IV: Techniques 
<br><br>
So now you've got a stiff lying seductively in front of you, but you
have no idea how to start. How you proceed from this point onward
really depends upon what kind of person you are. The corpse will last
longer if you treat it gently and with care, but if you prefer to go
all out you'll probably receive greater satisfaction. There are many
differences between screwing a live and a dead person which one needs
to be aware of. Firstly, a corpse will never tell you to get off of it
if you're being a bit rough and it will never complain no matter what
kinky sexual practices you use it for. Screwing a corpse is also much
more predictable because you can raise an arm, leg or whatever and it
will still be in that position when you reach for it again. Take the
arms and gently lock them in an embrace behind your back, or spread the
legs to make sex a bit easier. If you want a great blowjob then
lubricate your partner's mouth, lock it to your preferred width, insert
and go for it. Although there's no tongue stimulation it's still worthwhile, and it's also
safer than conventional sex. Corpses can also be recycled if treated
properly. If you're a proficient embalmer you can keep a corpse for
over five years if it has been properly embalmed. That's free sex
whenever you want it! You naturally don't want to be too rough with an
embalmed corpse though as they are more fragile. One final advantage of
screwing corpses is that they are always in abundance. Based upon your
sexual preferences you can designate a cemetery or a morgue as your
territory and always find fresh partners to screw. Plus you don't have
to resort to cheesy pickup lines or spend all your money in order to
get a date. Necrophilia is a passion which is cheaply satisfied. 
<br><br>
V. Conclusion 
<br><br>
I hope that this text file will encourage you to go out and try
necrophilia. Not many people do it, but that's precisely what makes it
so much fun; it makes you feel special! If no living person would touch
you with a 10 foot pole then try having sex with a corpse! Some of them
are real beauties and it's an experience you'll never forget. There is
no greater experience for a virgin than having his/her virginity taken
by a corpse. Anyways, have fun and if you have any experiences you'd
like to share then by all means do! Maybe necrophilia will enter the
mainstream because of your efforts.

<H3>Exegesis of this text</H3><br></center>
Of course I cannot leave  this opportunity for a small 'reversing' attempt of the 
intentions and aims of the Anonymous Author that did send me this text... after all 
I'm (supposed to be) a reverser...<br><br>I would like to take this opportunity 
in order to (try to) start a whole new 'lab' on my site: Text-exegesis, or, if you 
prefer, text-cracking. In a world where Internet is playing a continuously greater 
role, the might of the written text (as opposed to the might of the visual frills and 
of voices) is increasing in parallel. In the last 50 years, with humans 
overwhelmed by so many radiofonic, telephonic and televisual
'visual' stimuli, the great (old) arts of text reversing have seldom found in 
universities and research groups the place they do deserve. This will now of course change, 
thanks Internet, and since we are able to see what will happen before others do (don't 
remember that we are reversers :-) we may as well give our own small 
contribution.<br><br>I'll apply it right now to Gossip's text. here we go:<hr>
<br><font color=purple>
Dear +HCUkers and fellow necrophiliacs,
<br></font>
The opening is a classic 'troll' shocker. The rhetorical 
trick is called <i>exsuscitatio</i> and is here part of this <i>apostrophe</i>

<br><font color=purple>
After spending a significant number of 
hours browsing through the kernel update 
of the much overbloated Win98 (now cracked 
and available everywhere),
</font><br>Well... who is this guy? A protector? The snippet 
'now cracked 
and available everywhere' is a '<i>digressio</i>' that, like all digressio, can 
be used in order to stalk. The gtone here seems to me rather 'deploring-sad'.
The 'much overbloated' snippet is a '<i>citatio</i>', taken from the many essays 
on my site that accuse windows of overbloatedness, and IMO confirms this 
impression (see below the citatio of +ORC, Gates and my site)...

<br><font color=purple>
I decided to 
relax at around one in the morning and 
strolled down to the funeral home a few 
blocks away from my flat. After
selecting what appeared to be a normal 
(but freshly dead) 10- or 11-year-old girl 
in a rather exquisite mahogany casket, 
</font>
<br>
The whole text presents an iterational character, i.e.: the same 'figura' (here necrophily taken as 
granted) is repeated 
and amplificated continuously. The beginning is here 
particularly iperbolic. Technically this is part of the 'audacior ornatus' 
and is called parresia (or <i>licentia</i>): the Author expresses openly and 
bravely a thesis that can be shocking and could move the public against the 
Author and his message. <br>Note that  
the chosen corpse is that of a very young girl (note the '10 or 11' 
trick, btw), at once here you have necrophily, pedophily, burglary (the 
funeral home is supposedly closed at 'one in the morning') and 
a general well created 'Draculian' athmosfere (cfr the 'mahogany' 
casket touch :-) 

<br><font color=purple>
I fucked her fishy body for approximately 
fifteen minutes (screaming out Bill Gates'
name just about every other minute :-) and 
was suddenly inspired by the reality that 
most conventional protections against 
catching disease from rotting flesh are 
ineffectual at best. (Could there be "hidden
protections"?)</font><br>
The opening snippet 'fucked her fishy body' of this period are not 
neutralized by the more ironical "Gates screaming" part and represent 
the central vivid image  
that the Author transmits. This is a <i>hypotiposys</i>: the 
vivid, almost 'visual' description of a subject. The ancient greeks (that 
did not have any television) had developed this rethoric art to a point 
where a good speaker could have the audience see the colors, feel the 
surfaces and smell the scents just by choosing the right words... and you 
thought that virtual reality was new?
<br><font color =purple>

So, I considered the healths 
of my fellow HCU buddies, including +ORC, and 
decided to write the following up. (HCUers, 
watch out for a coming section related to 
corpse-humping at fravia.net!
Believe me, you haven't lived until you've 
had sex with as much lubricant as you want! 
Going to a hooker is nothing compared to 
this. :-)</fonT>
<bR>Any good stalker and text-reverser should 
immediatly see a warning red light in presence of 
verbs like 'humping'.  This is a specific slang for 
'to having sexual intercourse with someone' and it is 
definitely NOT a verb that a non-anglophone would or 
could use. 'my fellow HCU buddies' is clearly 
'tactic action irony' and confirms what we suspected above with 
the 'now cracked and available everywhere' snippet.
'Lubricant' is here methonimical for lubricous. 
'Hooker' is another hypotiposis, here used as a 'closing rehorical uppercut'.
<bR>
<font color=purple>
I: Introduction<br>Very 
few text files have been written regarding the sexual tendencies and 
practices of necrophiliacs...</font><bR>
The tone and the style changes. The following part has been written by 
another (much more educated) person. There are no references whatsoever to my 
site or cracking anymore. The <i>genus demonstrativum</i> is far superior to the 
Author of the apostrophe and snippets like '<font color=purple>There are many
differences between screwing a live and a dead person which one needs to be aware 
of.</font>' have an 'understatement' rhetorical 
power that differs completely from what we have seen in the apostrophe. Therefore I will 
not apply any reversing microanalysis to this part of the text.<bR><bR>
Conclusions: A somewhat acid american reader (unfortunately the link given in his email 
does not work) that has found somewhere and sent a 
very nice satirycal snippet as a 'provocation' towards the kind of anti-windoze's 
writings he has found (and read) on my site. This impression is 
confirmed also by his concluding pun '<font color=purple>fravia.net(asm)</font>' (which 
 technically is called a <i>paronomasia</i>... btw I strongly advice those among you interested 
in "text cracking" to learn 
the most common rhetorical figures... no advertisement whatsoever (nor politician 
promise :-) will ever have any grasp on you afterwards... <a href="https://searchlores.nickifaulk.com/realicra/howtosea.htm">seek</a> for 'rhetorical devices', 
'rhetorical structures', 'Plato's early dialectic', 'Toposforschung', 'Rhetorik',
 'Use of fallacy', 'Art of Persuasion', 'Theologie der Sprache', 'Dialogtecnik' and 
so on in any good search engine and you'll be embarked on a two years (at least) wonderful 
knowledge trip!
<br>The whole text sent by Gossip, taken alltogether, for those of you that are not yet bored to death and 
are still interested, is a classical 
example of <i>ductus subtilis</i>, where the Author simulates an opinion (<i>thema</i>: here 
the necrophilic attitude) with a concealed aim (<i>consilium</i>): to obtain 
in his audience a quite different effect, in this case a reflection about the 
absurd dimensions that any 'apparently logical' DIY booklet (introduction ~ finding a 
partner ~ preparation ~ conclusion) can obtain... of course the Author does not expect readers 
to have sexual intercourses with dead corpses after having read his text, duh.<bR>The whole piece is therefore an ironical 
simulation (exactly like Swift's 'A modest proposal') know also as <i>dissimulatio</i>. The paradox 
is the typical tool used for these aims ("L'important... n'est pas que cette fa�on 
de raisonner soit bonne, mais qu'elle fasse r�fl�chir", Camus).<bR>At times 
I wonder if this could
also apply to our software reverse engineering essays...
<bR><bR>
Awaiting your corrections/contributions/ameliorations...
