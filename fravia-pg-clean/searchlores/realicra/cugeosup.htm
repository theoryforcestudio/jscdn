Well, I would be scared as well if the information provided by 
Curious George should be confirmed to be true. I need a confirmation 
because I must admit that (until now)
 I have personally never encountered something that scary. Somebody wrote recently that
 a reality cracking essay was "<u>not only a shopping list from +ORC's
supermarket theory</u>". Nice words, yet I believe that 
-as you'll read in this very document- +ORC's 
great clever past seeds are still FAR from
 having been completely exploited... man, he wrote his <A HREF="slaves.htm">Supermarket enslaving tricks</A> in march 
1997... that's EONS ago in Web-time... and we are still far from really working on 
that... :-(<bR>
 As soon as I read Curious George's essay, I wished to add a 
couple of observations of my own, which I deem useful as a possible 
'starting snowball'.<bR>Said comments of mine will now follow, and 
regard specifically many 
'<u>European 'motor-road malls</u>'.  (I'm sure that my friends in the States -and elsewhere- 
will have very similar targets).<br>Anyway I have seen -and unfortunately experienced- these horrible things all over Europe (Möwenpick 
in Switzerland, 'Three goose' in Benelux), but I will use a 

 "made in Italy" example  that I unfortunately had to endure  once more  
during my last trip 
-per car- to Venice (in Italy, still a town without any car whatsoever, very nice 
indeed, 
even if 
the stupid political local populace is more and more  succeeding in 
transforming it in a sort of stupid (and useless) commercial cross between Disneyland 
and San Marino).<bR> 
To understand what follows (if you are reading this outside the European 
Union or in the middle of nowhere) you must know that 
there are some huge 'super-malls' built across the 
Italian motor-roads (called 'Alemagna' or 'Pavese' or whatever). 
I cannot understand why the 
hell someone in his right mind would want to sit down for his 
rare minutes of relax during a journey smack in the middle of a motor-road. 
 I believe that's sort of a masochistically oriented attitude, and that you would 
act that way only in order to watch even more cars running by (actually 
under your nose) 
at full speed... funny enough, after having  
tripped so many kilometers among (pukeworthy) zillions of similar cars...<br>
These malls are such an abomination... one wonders: 
why don't they build small cottages and rest places 
'in the green' instead, with no noises whatsoever, 
small tables and soft music under high shadowy trees, why don't they offer you 
a quiet place of silence, a small place where all the slaves 
that finally managed to escape for half an hour their car (or their Bus, 
or their lorry) would for a precious couple of minutes <u>NOT</u> be compelled to 
see, smell, touch, experience the frantic 
lurid traffic they had to endure during their whole journey?<br>
This kind of developments puzzle me quite a lot. Is it a purposefully 
prepared torture from 
some sadistically oriented power that be? Or, more simply, is it due to the fact that 
there's probably 
no low limit whatsoever in the idiotically European mimicking of every  
awful solution or trick that has been concocted -and applied- by the   
'commercial 
contorted' American minds?<bR>
Anyway just try it for the sake of it  and stop on your journey when you meet 
such places (quite a hard 
lesson to learn if you ask me, yet useful indeed). Stop there 
and have a cold long 'reverser' look around you (yes you are a green slimy alien in 
this context of happy idiots... just look, evaluate,  
register and send back info to this galaxy... pink funny stupid 
earthlings around you wont understand that you have come from the 'reality 
cracking academy' of Aldebaran :-)<br>Loo! These malls are so structured that you WILL NOT find your coffee 
or your toilets on the ground floor... you'll have to take an elevator, or a lift, 
to the first floor... but it will take you nevertheless quite a while to get to 
the 'level exit' (like in Doom, thinking of it... may be we should treat 
all our visits to a supermarket like a doom game... :-)
The criminal layout of these sites (I would like to dump the architects that 
studied and prepared these 'commercial killing fields' in the middle of a motor-road, 
possibly with a cement block around their feet...  
:-) will compel 
you to cross a labyrinth of interminable crappy products on offer... in order 
to finally get your simple coffee... the layout is stupid but effective:  in order to get to the bar or 
to the toilets 
all visitors MUST go through the whole assortment of overpriced salami, 
plastic model 
cars, videos, whatever crappish and totally useless they want to sell you (and <u>always</u> overpriced: 
anywhere in that country the same products would cost you less than on those motor-road 
malls). Once you have drunk your coffee or used the toilet you'll have -once more-  
to go trough a maze of crap in order to go out and continue your motor-road journey. 
<br>There's absolutely no way you 
can avoid this torture. What is really funny, btw, is that most of the ubiquitous 
'cretini con telefonini' and 'coglioni con gipponi' (the
main 'categories' of Italian citizens :-) seem to like it a lot. Moreover 
since most 
of the 'objects on offer' seem to be 'casually' stapled (in reality they are 
very artfully positioned... you feel as 
if it would just be so easy to pick some of them <i>en passant</i>), most of them hinder 
your movement through this commercial abomination. Therefore the 
only defense I was able to invent at the moment was to simply walk trough 
this seaweed of commercial crap WITHOUT caring 
the least about all the artful posed salami-mountains and "die cast car models" 
landscapes, 'reversing' (in the 
simplest -yet quite effective- sense of the word) mountains of them :-)
<bR>
Ok, I notice that this simple addition is getting too long... should you send 
feedback I'll try to extrapolate a real essay out of it...<br>

<bR><br>the discount supermarket 

<bR><br>by Curious George

<bR><br>23 December 1998
</H2></center>

<bR><br>There is a particular chain of discount supermarkets where I live
called "food 4 less". They claim that you will save between %20 
and %50 off of the same item from a different regular supermarket.
Well, I tried shopping there once. Very first thing I noticed
(lucky me, I read +ORC's essay before coming here, thank God)
was that there was ONLY ONE entrance. The slaves were FORBIDDEN
to enter at the other door, the ONLY exit.
<bR><br>
Now being immediately suspicious I go in with one of the
unusually large trollies. I see that I have no choice of
where to walk. So, I turn left. It turns out that the whole store
is positioned in a maze. YES! There are not normal grids of
isles, instead, the shelves are organized so that there is only one
path through the store. More than this... there are some turns that
lead to dead ends, on purpose of course.<bR> 
So, I decided to wait in the middle of the
maze -like a spider- and watch the slaves wandering up and back in
a daze. Most of them were a little apprehensive (where is the escape?). But
the soft muzik and the pretty meats and veggies made them "feel 
good". So, I noticed they would pass me with their trolly almost
empty (all of them had "huge" trolleys) and their shopping list finished. 
I thought: that's it, they are clever enough, after all, 
I won't see them again. I was 
wrong: A few minutes later, I would see them return in a daze....and
dissapear again. So, after a while; and a few more maze-crossing, I saw 
them again and again. 
Now, take notice, their trolly is QUITE FULL. Also, the shopping list is no 
longer in their hand. 
<bR><br>
So, now that I had my items and that I had finished my obeservations, 
I decided to leave. Being persistent
I found the exit (was not so easy after all, though).
 Now, here I notice that they have many many cash
registers. Maybe %50 more than usual, even if the store was the same size
as a normal mall. All queues, on the various lines, were very small. Once you 
actually found the exit you are supposed to beggar off as quickly as possible, probably. 
I also notice there was no "express"
line for those that only bought few items. Probably an almost impossible 
and blasphemous event. Then I realized that on the way in there were only
large push trollies, no small hand basket whatsoever! You were not supposed 
to buy just a couple of things or just the things you need... you were supposed 
to FILL YOUR TROLLEY UNTIL IT BURSTS!
<bR><br>
When i finally made it home, I examined my "fresh" products
carefully. Meat had a nice "redness" to it... while in the store. 
Yet, when I cut open the 
ground beef for dinner, it was much more "grey" inside: 
only the first 2cm of the 
meat was pink. They probably took old meat and mixed, putting some fresh 
meat ontop. This
is illegal where I live, yet they seemed to have done it. 
So, looking at my veggies, I noticed some "wax" 
on the apples. Carefully peeling off this "wax" I saw that my 'nice'  
polished apple has bruises on it. Looking at my milk, eggs, and
yogurt,  I see they are the same brand as my favourite store. This is not
unusual
in itself. However, even if according to labels the dairy was 
supposed to last for 2 weeks, the milk
was thick as cream in just one week.<bR>
I suspect therefore they bought old dairy from the usual 
supplier of my normal grocery and then somehow contrived to stamp 
false 'best before' date onto them. Else I'm seeking an explanation. 
<bR><br>
I went back a week later to test all this in more detail. For the meats, I
"secretly" 
poked a knife into the beef (being careful of the many casino style
black
camera bubbles... supermarkets are closely watched!). 
I constated that only part of the beef was bad!
<bR><br>
In the produce area, I did the same test. Once more, only some 
of the apples were 'waxed'. And with dairy too, only 
some of the milk was of the same brand I normally use, there ware many 
other kinds I never heard of. So, I
suspect 
that they present a mix of products: some almost stale, some fresh, 
so  that only 
at times it really happens that the slave gets real bad stuff, 
and anyway he is not supposed to realize that this is only 
happening at this "food 4 less" chain. Also, by using bad exemplars from 
a brand present on the good
store, the
slave will think that his milk from the good store went bad, not that bought 
from "food 4 
less".<bR>
By the way, on my second trip there, I did not buy anything at all. Great 
feeling of power, like a scientist in the Savana. Clerks 
were astonished to see me leave without buying anything. :)
<bR><br>
The second time I was there I noticed that the music <u>in the main
store area</u> was soft and slow. They repeat some songs again and again, 
but most of them are new and continuously changing. These patterns would need
more thorough investigation.<bR>
Also,
there were short ads inside the music. A soft male voice tells you
about
the special %60 percent discount for an item only available today!
Lighting changes chrominance slightly from place to place. I never saw
a clerk fixing the products, but the products were always fixed. In
the
exit row, music was different! It was faster. I think there were so
many
registers so they can get people out of the store fast so they don't
realize they just bought so much that THEY DIDN'T SAVE ANY MONEY AT
ALL
off of the total purchase.
<bR><br>
In conclusion, I am very scared of this store. I hope it doesnt become
the store model of the future. At least regular stores only suggest
with
subtle psychology what to do. They don't try to make you. I think
marketers (who are lower in my mind than even politicians and weapon
designers) have become so infatuated with their power over the masses
that they have lost any respect whatsoever for their fellow humans.
This illicit power has corrupted them and they somehow think they are
inherintly superior to the average man. I think though, that if the
trend
continues to be less hidden and try to force more from the slave, the 
slaves will start to wake from their slumber. 
Maybe I should say, I hope....
<bR><br>
I wish you good eating for the holiday's readers!
