<i>The attacks against the United States, on September 11th 2001, are a 
tragic and absolutely indefensible event.<br>
The sympathy on our planet for the United States,  now unfortunately 
squandered by the Bush administration, 
was complete, absolute and world-wide.<br>
The attacks  can and should not be condoned,  
nor should they ever be underestimated, nor 
bypassed in silence.<br> 
The attacks did represent a tragic setback for our civilization, 
and a criminal, barbaric act of terrorism.<br><br>
This said, the concept of a "<font color=blue>just war</font>", invoked 
to justify the  United States' reaction to these 
attacks has serious flaws. While the attacks themselves are 
indefensible on any grounds, as I said, I cannot regard the present 
"war against Iraq" as wise, nor do I believe that it
will lead to any "security" nor 
seems to me in any way characterizable as 
a "just" war.<br><a name="upnote2"></a>
Moreover it seems to me likely that a unilateral assault on a desperate,  
poor and already starving(<a href="propawar.htm#note2">1</a>) 

population will of course amplify anger toward american 
policy and increase, rather than decrease, the threat of international terrorism. I also 
seriously doubt 
that human rights are served by plans to fire some 800 cruise missiles 
on a city the size of Los Angeles.
<br>
<br>
I believe that a sound exegesis of  many of the 
texts that seekers are able to find 
on the web will demonstrate my point. 
<br>

<br> <i>
Yet, notwithstanding the many USA propaganda lies and "Saddam demonisation" attempts, 
let's be, at least among us reversers, 
also quite clear about the Iraqi President, a man who, frankly speaking,
is very easy to demonize.<br>  
Personally I have no doubt whatsoever as to the terror of the Iraqi 
regime, if you need proofs, 
read the reports of the United Nations’ Special Rapporteurs on Iraq, 
<font color=blue>Van der Stoel</font> (<a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/1998/19980416.HRCN856.html">UN 
press release HR/CN/856</a>), 1998 
and <font color=blue>Mavrommatis</font> (<a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2001/gashc3659.doc.htm">UN 
press release GA/SHC/3659</a>), 2001. You can find more documents, of course, using the search engine at <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/full.htm">http://www.un.org/News/Press/full.htm</a> and/or 
the archives search facility at 
<a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/archives.htm">http://www.un.org/News/Press/archives.htm</a>. <br>
<br>But the fact that the iraqi regime might be easily demonized 
does not justify in the least the awful 'ripple effects' already travelling  
around the globe, of 
these unfounded USA claims about a  
"right to strike first" and to "suspend fundamental human rights protection". The 
consequence of this barbaric involution, that recalls what happened in Germany 
in last century's thirties, will be devastating for humankind.</i>
<br><br>
As usual however, our <a href="http://www.aeronautics.ru/"
ALT="click on gru reports">web searching skills</a> and our 
capacity to see 'through' propaganda patterns may be useful to 
show whose hands, and why, are moving which 
puppets. Alas, in this case, many of the puppets are going to die.

<font size=+1>
 Over 70 years ago, the British diplomat Lord Arthur Ponsonby 
(1871-1946) wrote in his book <i><a href="http://www.heretical.com/miscella/ponsonby.html">Falsehood in Wartime</a></i> about the 
perennial propaganda claims of wartime leaders. Let's examine them anew, on the <i>falsariga</i> 
of a nice book by Anne Morelli (<i>Principes &#233;l&#233;mentaires de propagande de guerre</i>). 
We will concentrate in this essay 
on the  "semiosphere" and "liescape" surrounding Iraq, but occasional references to 
the II Wolrld War, the Vietnam War or the Israeli/Arab wars should keep readers aware of the 
fact that hysterical war-propaganda is NOT limited geographically, politically, racially, or 
temporally.  As you can check in the newspapers you are reading, the TV-"information" you receive, 
Goebbels' articles, Reuter's press releases or 
the Old testament.

</center><br>

The FIRST common denominator of all propagandists, and of their warmonger masters, 
is the continuous, rancorous 
affirmation that they "DO NOT WANT" a war. No, no, no, really.  War is a very unpopular choice, and the 
old Latin spell: <i>"si vis pacem para bellum"</i>  has always been used 
to assure the propaganda 
slaves 
that 
all war preparations are "in the reality" just steps 
taken to AVOID a war, of course: we do not want a war, we may be compelled to go to war, but 
only to DEFEND ourselves, never never never because we want a war.
<br><br>
"<font color=blue>We stand for peace, we do not want war,"... (<b>General Musharraf</b>, Dictator 
of Pakistan) ...said at a dinner 
in the presidential palace. "We will never initiate a war unless 
it is thrust . . . upon us. We want peace, we do not want war. 
We understand all the hazards that will follow.</font>"  
<br><br>
"<font color=blue>Given the choice, we do not want war, but if it is imposed on us, we will fight," 
<b>Saddam</b> said on Iraqi state television</font>"     
<br><br>
"<font color=blue>At a news conference last week, <b>Blair</b> said 
he was eager to avoid war in Iraq and determined to work through the United 
Nations. "Let me make one thing plain," he said. "We do not want war. 
No one wants war.</font>"  
<br><br>
"<font color=blue>SECRETARY <b>POWELL</b>: Right now we're not talking about war. 
Right now we're talking about finding a peaceful solution to this. Nobody wants war. 
President Bush does not war. I do not want war. </font>"  
<br><br>
"<font color=blue> We do not want war with France! We do not want anything from France! Nothing at all!</font>"
(<b>Adolf Hitler</b>, 27 September 1938)
<br><br>
"<font color=blue>President <b>Bush</b> spoke forcefully, but calmly Tuesday. His message 
to the nation and the entire world — and even to Saddam Hussein — 
was that the United States <u>does not want war</u>, but will not shirk from 
it if the danger posed by Iraq’s murderous dictator does not subside.</font>" 
<br><br>
More on this sequence:<br>
"the United States does not want war. But Iraqi intransigence has engendered..."
<br>
"the United States does not want war, but merely to disarm a tyrant..."
<br>
"the United States does not want war but it has
been shoved down our throats..."
<br>        
"the United States does not want war but will lead allied forces into battle 
to secure an authentic peace..."
<br>
"the United States does not want war but we must stand 
and fight the war that the rest of the world chooses to ignore..." 
<br> 
"America does not want war. America does not start wars. America does 
not oppress people. America is not the cause of the world’s problems. 
And America does not have imperial aspirations."
<br><br>And yet, often times, real simpletons speak loud and clear the truth &nbsp;:-)<br>

"<font color=blue>Sometimes that means you have to disturb the peace 
to make peace. It means sometimes that you have to 
wage war to end tyranny and terror. Sometimes you have <u>to bomb 
the hell out of people to get them to do what you want</u>. America does not want war. 
America wants peace. It's the evil Iraqi dictator who wants war. That much 
is clear. The murderous Saddam Hussein's refusal to disarm, his constant 
deception and games of 
hide and seek make it clear that Saddam wants war.</font>" ("<b>President Bush</b>", march 2003)

<br><br>
"<font color=blue>We are not spoiling for a battle. We
are not eager to put our fighting men and women at risk. We do not
wish to shoulder burdens and assume costs that others, by right,
should share. But we will not allow the scorpion that bit us once to
bite us again. We have not ruled out any options. If Saddam provokes a
fight, he will get one, and he will lose.</font>"  (<b>Martin S. Indyk</b>, 
Assistant Secretary of State 
for Near Eastern Affairs)

<br>The SECOND common denominator, is a direct consequence of the first...<br>
<br>
        <i>
    The 'enemy' is always the aggressor, many times 
a 'madman', and often a 'tyrant', a 'dictator', a 'devil', 
capable of all most infame actions. He has no heart, no brain, no logic. 
He does never respect treaties, he is -per definition- a traitor. Note also that 
treaties are always 'holy and sacred' for those that would like them  to be respected, and just 'scrap paper' or 'obsolete' 
or 'no more actual' 
for those that want to ignore, break, violate them.</center>

- Saddam wants war</font>"

"<font color=blue>Saddam has made the case for war against 
his corrupt and dangerous regime ten times over, by his own 
hand...</font>"   (Senator <b>Arlen Specter</b>)  
<br><br>
"<font color=blue> A cruel tyrant to his own people, who continually 
attacks his neighbours, Saddam is responsible for hundreds of 
thousands of deaths in wars that were triggered by him, in the 
repression of his compatriots and the purge of opponents and even 
members of his own family... </font>" (Spanish Prime Minister <b>Jose Maria Aznar</b>)

<br><br>
"<font color=blue>Actually, Poland never was a democracy. An infinitesimal, degenerate 
upper class ruled not only over foreign nationalities, but also over what they 
called their own people. It was a State ruled by brute force, by the police and, 
as a last resort, 
also by the army. The lot of the Germans in this country was terrible... Poland has sown war and reaped war...</font>" 
(<b>Adolf Hitler</b>, Speech 
at the Langer Market 
in Danzig 
Tuesday, September 19, 1939)

Real warmongers claim always to be lambs in a world of wolves, who are of course responsible for the 
'collateral damages'.

The THIRD common denominator, the 'demonisation' of the enemies, is of paramount importance.
<br>For most human beings, it takes an awful lot to allow them 
to kill another human being. The only way to drill them 
is to justify the killing, making the enemy look as <b><u>beast-like</u></b> 
and as <b><u>evil</u></b> 
as possible.<br>
The demonisation is often 
also accompanied by a 'leader personification' of the enemies, due to the fact that you cannot seriously 
hate a whole 'population' without being as ridiculous (and dangerous) 
as the nazi with the jews, it is not 'bon ton' any more to hate a whole race in 
these 'politically correct times... 
so you have to concentrate your propaganda name-calling on the leader(s) 
of "our" supposed 'enemies'.<br>
<br>
<i>Hence it's Milosevic, Hitler, Saddam, Stalin, Napoleon, the Kaiser... whomever, and sure
 
not (yet) 'the Serbs', 
'the Germans', 'the Iraqis', 'the Russians', 
'the French', 'the San Marinoers' :-)<br>Since, alas alas alas, 
'war cannot be avoided' if 
"we" are facing pure 100% evildoers, hissing snakes, venoum spitting 
spiders, kids eating monsters and women raping monkeys (monsters and monkeys 
being in both last  cases the subjects). The leader of the enemies 'must' be a dangerous, sadistic, 
indefendable criminal "tyrant". Brainless zombies with a three seconds attention span, 
the target of all kind of  
propaganda, need 
a clear distinction between 'good white hat guys' with blue eyes and blond hair 
and evil 'dark hat baddies', with bad manners and a low treacherous, cowardish attitude.</i>

        "<font color=blue>On Saddam Hussein's orders, opponents have

(<b> the USA Foreign Policy Research Institute</b>)
<br><br>
<b>Powell </b> described Saddam's "<font color=blue>conniving and continued</font>"  
effort to "<font color=blue>fool</font>" the U.N. inspectors and the rest of the world, as 
"<font color=blue>evil genius</font>"    

<br><br>
"<font color=blue>In my judgment, you don't contain Saddam Hussein </font>  
[<b>Bush</b> said, referring to the preference of some European allies]<font color=blue>  
 You don't hope that therapy will somehow change his evil mind</font>"  

<br><br>
The secretary of state acknowledged that war is 
not pleasant. But he said that the Germans should understand that 
"<font color=blue>sometimes <u>war cannot be avoided</U> when you are facing a form of evil 
that Saddam Hussein embodies</font>" 
<br><br>   

<b>President Bush</b> "<font color=blue>referred to Hussein at various points </font>[of 
a prime-time news conference, televised live on all the major networks from 
the East Room of the White House, March 6 2003] <font color=blue>
as a cancer, a murderer, a master of deception and just generally 
an inhuman fiend who must be destroyed or exiled</font>".    
<br><br>      
        On the other hand, the 
Iraqi daily newspaper Al-Iraq denounced "<font color=blue>the forces of 
evil and aggression, led by the great Satan — the United States — 
and its arrogant idiot President Bush</font>"
<br><br>
"<font color=blue>In America, we say everybody is precious, 
everybody counts, everybody is equal in the eyes of the Almighty,</font> [Bush told American 
troops at Fort Hood, January 2003]<font color=blue> 
That's not what the enemy thinks. They don't value innocent life. 
They're nothing but a bunch of cold-blooded killers, and 
that's the way we're going to treat them</font>"

<i>
But never forget that the contrary may happen: here an example of  
an attempt to "de-leaderize" the culprit question...   
and attack instead a whole population/race

(actually: almost only) with jews, and is  
a classical sign of <u>heavy</U> racist attitudes.

<br><br>

    "<font color=blue>The fact that <b>Sharon</b> has been a top "statesman" in

as its top leader?</font>"

<table border=1 width=88%><tr><td bgcolor="#C6E7C6"><center><font
size=+3>We defend a noble (and/or holy) cause!</font>&nbsp;</center></td></tr></table>
<br>The FOURTH common denominator is that there are -of course- NO specific political or 
economic
 interests to defend. Not at all. 
The aims of "our" war are all the noblest you can think of: freedom, 
democracy, development,  human rights, defense of a minority ruthlessly oppressed 
(by a majority, la va sans dire), 
progress of humankind, liberation of the masses... you  name it.<br> 
 The fact, for instance, that the US National debt has reached 
<a href="http://www.brillig.com/debt_clock/">6,5 trilliards</a> and 
that the <a href="../euroiraq.htm">successful use of the euro</a> (introduced one year ago) as 
reserve currency and oil-currency  could 
blow the hot baloon is  seldom mentioned to explain the iraq affair.
<br>The other simple matter of fact: that USA Oil-imports amount to 11.2 million barrels per 
day, <a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/pgulf.html">63% of it from saudi arabia</a>, and its 60-year-old monopoly lease of Saudi 
oil fields will come to an end in 2005, <a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/usa.html">is also almost</a> 
never discussed.
<br><br>
Anyway, in general "our" cause may even be "holy", and holy causes (Gott mit uns) 
MUST be defended against pagans and unbelievers. 
War as crusade. See old testament, Osama bin Laden, Conquistadores, 
Crusaders.<br>
<br>
<i> This is easy to understand: 
    people usually, even propaganda conditioned zombies,  
do not like the idea to have to die or to have to kill for specific 
geopolitical targets or for 
someones' economical gains. <a name="upnote1"></a>But they 
may accept  to die or kill for 'democracy(<a href="propawar.htm#note1">2</a>)', 'religion', 'ideology' and 
of course, 'to defend themselves'.  This explains the curious and almost 
absolute silence always 
surrounding 
the geographical, political and economical targets of any conflict.

<br>The FIFTH common denominator is that the enemies is intent on evildoing, and purposedly commits atrocities, 
while we always make some unavoidable and regrettable 'mistakes'<br>
<br>
        <i>Our armies are composed of 
holy paladins, performing a duty. They deeply believe into with professionalism and  
in the most civilized manner, and are of course always 
'at the services' of the civil population, even at the service 
of the 'enemy' civilians, come to think of it, always trying the outmost 
to avoid any 'collateral damage'.
<br> 
Since we are fighting for a 'just war' (and against a criminal enemy)  
our troops will be always welcome and loved by anyone, and eo ipso
find enthusiastic ovations from the invaded enemies once 
"we" will --of course-- win.<br> The enemies' armies, on the countrary, kept together by terror and intimidation, 
are composed almost exclusively of criminal torturers, soulless 
terrorists, bandits 
that ignore every 'civilized' 
convention, women rapers and children killers, sneaky cowards that routinely 
hyde in churches, schools and hospitals and use the civil population at large 
as a 'human shield' (these last evil 
techniques may also help to explain some possible 'glitches' of our, where necessary).</i>

    [<font color=blue>scattered babies</font>]<br>
     Saddam  allowed babies at a Kuwaiti 
hospital to be "<u>pulled from incubators and scattered

of the second one). The story has been demonstrated to be untrue,  
made up by a Kuwaiti diplomat's daughter]

  [<font color=blue>disgusting cowards</font>]<br>
"They have executed prisoners of war. ... 
They have used women and children as human shields

  [<font color=blue>Prisoners of propaganda</font>]<br>

British Defense Minister, Geoff Hoon, told reporters on March 24 
that there was "an enormous difference" between "the factual photographs  
of prisoners surrendering to the allied forces 
as against the appalling, barbaric behaviour of Iraqi 
forces dealing with American prisoners."  Meanwhile 
 the United States observed that "the Geneva Conventions 
are not technically applicable to detainees from 
the war in Afghanistan or the 
wider campaign against terrorism"

<br><br>
"<font color=blue>Operation Iraqi freedom</font>" (sic)
<br><br>
We do not perform '<font color=blue>bombardments</font>': we organize 
'strikes', "chirurgical strikes", "selective strikes", we may be 
"striking selected targets of military importance".
<br><br>
We do not '<font color=blue>kill civilians</font>': alas, there may be some, inevitable, 'collateral damages', 
though, especially when stupid civilians get in the way.
<br><br>                                                                 
We will not '<font color=blue>invade</font>' Iraq: our 
'peacekeeping force' will 'enter' Iraq, to 'implement our peace plan' 
and bring freedom to a suffering population.     Our military invasion is just a
 "broad and coercive campaign".   There are some "military operations", of course, 
but the aim is "to disarm Iraq, to free its people and to defend the world from grave 
danger".  
<br><br>   
        We do not "blast a target to destruction", god forbid, we
 just  "<font color=blue>take out</font>" a 
target. 
<br><br> 
        "<font color=blue>Regime target</font>": every target we are destroying: army, security 
services, television stations, firemen.
<br><br>
There may be, eentually, some oddball 
"<font color=blue>pockets</font>" of resistance, of course we 
have them in the pocket.
<br><br>
"<font color=blue>deferred compensation</font>" euphemism for bribes (one million dollars every year to Dick 
Cheney  from Halliburton,  a firm that during recent months
received various multibillion-dollar, open-ended, no-bid contracts from Cheney himself)
<br><br>  
         "<font color=blue>Kinetic targeting</font>" means "dropping bombs": when a cruise 
missile destroys a target, that is  called  "Kinetic targeting".
<br><br>
 An apparently unsuccessful attempt to kill the Iraqi President and his sons, 
at the beginning of the invasion has been defined a "<font color=blue>target 
of opportunity</font>"
<br><br>     
The USA will not '<font color=blue>occupy</font>' Iraq, instead our 
'international force' will "for some period of time" 
have --of course-- to 
'protect the security' of the civil population and of the 
'exiled minorities', that have 'a right to return home' and live in freedom and drink coca cola light and eat genetically modified gourmet plates.
<br><br>   
        Of course there is no discussion about building '<font color=blue>enclaves</font>' in 
Iraq. What we may have to do, if ever, is to establish some 'international protectorates' of course for the good and wellbeing of the populace.
<br><br>
Our soldiers will not suffer '<font color=blue>shell shock</font>', god forbid, 
and not even '<font color=blue>combat 
fatigue</font>', coz the word 'combat' is still there and is too harsh. So they 
may be allowed to have, at most, 
some <font color=blue>post traumatic stress disorder</font>'. But they wont, mostly.
<br><br>
Enemies' attacks and surrounding maneuvers are 
mostly "<font color=blue>local positionings</font>" or even, 
at times,  "<font color=blue>survival positionings</font>".    
<br><br> When our side is in deep trouble, we are performing a
 "<font color=blue>operational pause</font>"   
<br><br>
Note also how the stiff resistence encountered in Iraq has gradually 
shifted the rhetorical 
"targeting" from 
the "<font color=blue>evil dictator Saddam</font>" to the "<font color=blue>Regime hawks</font>" and their 
"<font color=blue>death squads</font>" or "<font color=blue>terror squads</font>". 
These "death squads" are a funny 
Pentagon's lingo for "patriot fighters" and/or "partisans" and/or "Fedayeen". <br>Fedayeen means in turn, 
literally, "someone willing 
to sacrifice himself" (not exactly "martyrs"). "Fedayeen" has been used for 
years to refer to the PLO fighters of the 1960s and '70s. By appropriating this term, 
Iraqi are --of course-- just attempting to blur the lines between the Palestinian 
cause and their own. 
<br>Also used: 
Saddam's "<font color=blue>henchmen</font>" (like calling US marines "George's henchmen")
<br><br>
"<font color=blue>Peacekeepers</font>" (also, often: "<font color=blue>international 
peacekeepers</font>"): Occupation troops.  
<br><br>
"<font color=blue>International Security Assistance Force</font>": Occupation troops.  
<br><br>

"<font color=blue>renegade rebel</font>": enemy commander
<br><br>  
        "<font color=blue>beleaguered defenders</font>": The enemy.
<br><br>    
Our troops "<font color=blue>dash</font>" and "<font color=blue>sweep</font>" around.
<br><br>
Our soldiers are "murdered" or "massacrated", our enemies are 
instead "<font color=blue>softened up</font>".  This is only for 
the Bush side, the Iraqi side is less 
euphemistical: "<font color=blue>We were able to chop off their rotten heads</font>"

    There are some common, easy ways to 'reverse' war propaganda. I'll try to syntethize them here, 
please excuse the shortcomings of this quick, synthetical debunking. Your own observations, critics 
and suggestions would be  welcome.
        </i>
</center><br> <ol><li>
<b>The "reinforcement" rule</b>:<br>
Every time renforcements are called for, used, proposed, sent, the situation for the part 
using/needing 
 reinforcement is "in the reality" deteriorating. Note that this is always 
true <u>for both parts</u>.

</li><br>
 <li><b>The "internecine fighting" rule</b>:<br>   
Everytime, shortly before an assault, our side spreads news of 'civil war', "army 
commanders' dissence" and/or  
'internecine fighting' or "popular unrest"  
among the forces of the enemy camp, it means that a very bloody 
battle has already been envisaged by 
our side, and that 
we want to be able to showel part of the responsability of the future 
civilian casualties on "our" enemy.
</li><br>
 <li><b>The "kids have been taken as hostage" rule</b>:<br>  
Everytime you want to explain that annoying 
'stubborn' and 'suicidal' resistance to our advances, the reason 
must be found in some kind of evil enemy's blackmail, 
"they menaced to kill their families if they 
do not fight against us".<br>
It is simply not possible that somebody 
would fight for his country against "our" holy mission without being "immorally blackmailed" or 
"brain washed".
Note that this is always true <u>for both parts</u>.
  
</li><br>
 <li><b>The "technical glitches" rule</b>:<br> 
  Everytime the number of    "technical glitches", "silly incidents" or 
"friendly fire casualties" 
among "our" forces increases abnormally during 
a given time slice, "we" have in the reality 
encountered serious resistance (which would be 
impossible to account for according to our own propaganda). 

</li><br>
 <li><b>The "Geneva conventions violation" rule</b>:<br>
Everytime the enemy "violates the Geneva conventions",  
(of course such as "we do interprete them", being the 
<a href="http://www.hri.ca/uninfo/treaties/92.shtml">Geneva conventions</a> masterpieces 
of duplicity and vagueness) our holy side is "almost"

 <li><b>The "if they move they still exist" rule</b>:<br>    
The fact that the enemy performs "maneuvers" (or even attacks) 
and causes "limited damage" or "momentary bogging" to our ever advancing 
(or courageously defending) 
forces 
 means  that the enemy is still able to go on the offensive despite our announced 
successes. Note that this is always true <u>for both parts</u>.
    </li><br>
 <li><b>The "stale news" rule</b>:<br>   
If a whole day passes without any "news" of our "victories", and if the most recent 
"victorious" news are just repeated (with slight variations) "we" can be 
sure that "our" forces have encountered some reverses.    Note that 
this is always true <u>for both parts</u>.

2001: One infant out of four born live in Iraq weighs less than 2 kilos (1989: one out of 20), UN-data.

        <br><br><a name="note1"></a>(<a href="propawar.htm#upnote1">2</a>)&nbsp; &nbsp; Note 
that the  'we defend democracy' trick is at times hard to sell: 
in the case of the previous war for the control of the oilfields of Kuwait, 
a country notoriously as repressive, feudal, anti-democratic and 
olygarchical as Saudi Arabia, it would have been 
impossible to profile the war as a defence of "democracy",
not even in comparison with Iraq. Hence  the propaganda "refrain" 
was, instead, the holy need to defend "a small country" against 
a "big bully", and "peace in the region" against an "evil aggressor".
