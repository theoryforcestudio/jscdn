Yes! Jawohl! Right so! ...and I hope to receive MANY MORE essays on these lines. For the first time in 
the history of humanity... well, actually I'm not kidding: have 
a search around and see what else you can find :-) the power and 'cleverness' of the Web offer us CONSUMER, guinea pigs of the marketing mavericks, give us   
stupid pavlovian slaves, whose brains are being relentlessly maimed to 
mud by tons of ads every 
minute of our poor lives, allow us the possibility to understand (first) exchange knowledge (second) 
and retaliate (third). Great! Read and head! And work! Let's go up from consumers to 
human beings, let's learn how to counter all the pavlovian techniques of 
the slave masters!

<hR width=44%></center>
<b>Introduction</b><bR>
As you probably know, there is a whole scientific branch called 'consumer behavior'. What 
you might not know, unless you are on the take, is that there are MANY other less known disciplines aimed 
at allowing a better (in fact an absolute) control of the consumer (i.e. you).<bR>
The declared purpose of these studies is to fool you into buying gadgets and products 
you don't need (or are downright harmful to you) playing on your most elementary 
feelings. Pavlov and Goebbels would never have dreamed a so scary (and almost perfect) 
world of hidden and concealed compulsions. In order to defend yourself you must first 
of all understand the techniques used by your enemy. I'll here just <u>list</u> some of them, as 
you will see, this is scary enough per se.
<p>
A word of warning: once you will have understood the basic aims of some of the techniques used 
in order to tame consumers, 
you'll see your own life from a completely different point of 
view. While you may already have experienced something similar reading master +ORC's 
famous '<a href="slaves.htm">supermarket enslavement</a>' essay (the masterpiece that started all sort of 
"reality reversing" studies), I know how upsetting this can be, especially once you'll 
have found yourself in a very peculiar position vis-à-vis almost all your friends and 
social relations: in fact they will mostly NOT understand the problem at all. See: some 
of them will have bought and wear colored nice T-shirts carrying advertisements or huge 
industrial logos on them; some other will have just returned from the mall with a lot of 
nice colored bags filled with "offers" they just couldn't resist buying; 
others, while apparently "listening" to you, will have 
turned the TV set on and happily munch 
some "crusty choco-bars" or some "chips" (or whatever they <u>had 
to</u> buy) under its continuous ads' bombarding... in fact the situation 
may dangerously recall you 
those science-fiction 
films of the fifties where everybody but the hero is completely controlled by some little 
green aliens... no, actually you'll feel even worse: you'r not an hero, you'r just sorta like an 
ameba that has escaped from underneath the microscope's slide and took a look at the 
scientific lab. It is NOT always a very nice feeling :-(
<p>
So I'll here -as introduction- just list some techniques, and show some examples... you'll 
be able to check how terribly true they are all by yourself, as you'll see, 
it's pretty easy to individuate them... once you know where to look.
<p>
<b>Consumer Behavior</b><bR>
The purpose of  "Consumer Behavior", as a discipline (which is a fairly young branch, 
with textbooks beginning to show up in the '60s), is to provide "a foundation for marketing 
management" through the advanced use of psychological, medical, ethical, cultural and 
historical knowledge on human behavior. In fact in order to allow what they also 
hypocritically call 'the development of a managerial strategy', these disciplines use 
(and  misuse) theories and concepts from all the behavioral sciences - psychology, 
social psychology, sociology, anthropology, demography, and economics. In fact the 
marketing and advertisement 'scientists' -as you will see- act just like those nazi and 
Japanese doctors of the '40s, that conducted criminal experiments on human prisoners.
<p>
The direct result of all these efforts is an almost pavlovian 'branding' of illiterate 
consumer minds, just to cite a typical, investigated example, when shown logos of 
children's brands, adult's brands and consumer products, over 51% of children aged 
3 to 6 recognized the "Old Joe" camel cigarette logo. I repeat: children between 3 
and 6 (!) and  a CIGARETTES image! Second came Nike's logo. (source: Fischer  "Brand 
logo recognition by children aged 3 to 5 years," JAMA, December 11, 1991, 3145-3148).
<p>
In the following text I'll use my own terminology: the term 'slave masters' is used 
to denote the unhealthy alliance between 'consumer behaviorists',  'marketing buffs', 
'commercial sellers/producers' and politician and media anchormen that defend such 
a society and profit from it (let's not forget just to make an example, that the Reagan 
administration purposely reduced funding to many of the agencies responsible for enacting 
the consumer laws). Clearly the term is vague and imprecise, yet it does the job. The term 
'puppets' or 'puppet-models' is used to denote the use of 'celebrities' in advertising 
and media for mass-control and mass-influencing purposes.
<p>
<b>Memory patterns</b><br>
One of the main problems for the slave masters is that consumers have a limited 
capacity to process information - information overload can impede consumer 'learning' 
(from their point of view, learning means here being conditioned with the need to 
buy a determinate product). Since emotions strongly influence how information is 
processed they are widely used in advertising. In fact Memory processes are 
influenced by affect and arousal.<br>
A simplified memory model has three components: sensory memory, short-term memory, 
and long-term memory.<br>
'Sensory memory' is a pre-attention stage where a stimulus is briefly 
analyzed to determine if it will receive additional processing (short-term 
in duration, usually less than a second), then follows the 'Short-term memory' 
stage - where information is temporarily stored while processing. If this information 
is not rehearsed (silently repeated to encode into long term memory) it is lost 
within 30 seconds. Short-term memory is characterized by limited capacity - 
Miller's law states people can handle 7 (+ or - 2) bits of information at a time. 
Information is transferred from short-term to long-term memory when it has been 
rehearsed with a transfer process known as encoding. Recall will be more difficult 
if there is clutter or too many stimuli. Example: the plethora of commercials on a 
Superbowl program make it difficult for the viewer to recall any one specific 
commercial. Long-term memory stores the meanings of words, symbols along with the 
associations among various semantic concepts. Here it is important to notice 
that 1) visual images or pictures tend to be more memorable than their verbal 
counterparts, especially when there is low-involvement on the part of the 
consumer; and 2) words that have high-imagery content are superior to words 
that do not. Example: high imagery words: table or car, low imagery words- 
future or peace. The slave masters of course concentrate on the storage process 
into and on the retrieval process from Long-term memory, so consumers will 
retrieve the conditioning presented with the advertisements when faced with 
a choice. Retrieval can be enhanced by repetition of a symbol from the 
advertisement to the package and by attaching a memorable jingle or 
music to the advertisement. This is 'brand imprinting'.
<p>
<b>Brand imprinting</b><br>
Brand imprinting consists of a brand 'node' implanted in memory which links a 
variety of associations (brand name, brand's characteristics, advertisements 
about the brand, the product category, and emotional reactions to the brand 
and its advertisements).
<p>
Some shrewd techniques are here used to numb the consumer, the most common 
one takes advantage of a psychological characteristic of our specie called 
the <b>Zeigarnik effect</b> (if a task is interrupted, material relevant to the task 
tends to be remembered ).<br>
This is the concept behind all interrupted :15 second commercials. The 
first :15 presents 'information', is interrupted with a :30 that is different, 
and then a :15 returns to complete the presentation of the material begun with 
the first :15. This snaps the Zeigarnik effect: the slave will remember.
<p>
<b>Behavioral learning and conditioning</b><br>
'Behavioral learning' is the nice name that the slave masters have found for 
'consumer conditioning'. It is divided in three main sectors: Classical 
consumer conditioning, Operant consumer conditioning and Vicarious consumer 
conditioning.<br>
Classical conditioning - behavior is influenced by a stimulus that 
occurs prior to the behavior and elicits it in a manner that appears 
to be a reflex. Advertisers try to identify messages, sights or sounds 
that will elicit positive reactions from consumers to associate their 
product with a positive stimuli - thus eliciting a positive reaction 
to the product (half-naked babe on the car roof). The classical conditioning 
framework was discovered by Ivan Pavlov in his work with dogs and those same 
principles are ACTIVELY used by the slave masters. You better understand them, 
at least in their most elementary form.
<hr><font color=olive>In classical conditioning, a previously 
neutral stimulus (the conditioned stimulus or CS) is repeatedly paired with 
the eliciting stimulus (the unconditioned stimulus or UCS). To be effective 
the CS needs to occur prior to the UCS so it predicts the UCS. After a 
number of pairings, the ability to elicit a response is transferred from 
the UCS to the CS. The response is called the conditioned response or CR.
</font><hR>  
A couple of examples: stores and mall all over the world know that the tempo 
of music played in the store resulted in various shopping speeds by consumers. The 
slower (and rithmic) the music, the slower (and almost trance-inducted) the 
shopping speed, the more (up to 40% !!) groceries 
purchased. La va sans dire that the customers would NOT have purchased 
this surplus if they could have maintained self-control. It is also 
obvious that music is only ONE of the 'hypnotizing' factors in play (see 
+ORC's essay). 
Note that customers are <u>completely unaware</u> of any differences in music cadence, 
since the effects of music operate at below consciousness levels. Music is also 
used purposely elsewhere: take restaurants: although customers take more time to complete 
their dinners when slow music is played, liquor sales increase. Every time 
the consumers take longer to eat, the time spent waiting for food increase 
the sales of liquor & aperitifs & second bottles of wine or mineral water made 
while waiting for the food... a trade off between number of times a table can be 
used and higher recipes per consumer... so to say a "slow food benefit" vis-à-vis fast 
food joints.
<p>
Another example, all stimuli associated with spending money (credit card 
insignias) actually elicite a spending response in shoppers. Yet another example: 
Using the symbol of the national flag (a conditioned stimulus) with a product 
or service (a previously neutral stimulus). The product or service gains 
increased status via higher order conditioning. Note that the conditioned 
stimulus should be consistently paired with the unconditioned stimulus. For 
example, if the slave masters use a 'celebrity bait' with a product in an 
advertisement, the celebrity should be shown in point-of-purchase displays as well.<br>
Operant conditioning - behavior is influenced by the consequences of the 
behavior. Sales promotion and 'personal selling' involve providing consumers 
with reinforcers and/or punishments to influence later behavior. Operant 
conditioning is often used inn order to shape consumer responses - like 
training animals. Totally new operant behaviors can be created by selectively 
reinforcing behaviors that successively approximate the desired instrumental 
response. This happens for example giving consumers a free sample of a 
product. The reinforcement is the product's performance. The added reinforcement 
is the enclosed coupon for purchase. In the promotional mix, operant 
conditioning is particularly applied to personal selling and sales 
promotion. Sales people attempt to reinforce desired behaviors of clients by 
reinforcers (compliments, smiles, lunches, Christmas gifts) . Buying 
behaviors are shaped with sales promotions, discounts, coupons, samples, 
and contests.<br>
Vicarious conditioning - behavior is influenced by observing the actions of 
others and by modeling or imitating those actions. Many advertising strategies 
make use of appealing puppet-models (Jordan, Spice girls, whatever) using a 
product or experiencing its positive outcomes in the hopes the consumer will 
imitate the behavior. Effectiveness of the puppet-model increases in the 
following instances: 1.The puppet is physically attractive. 2. The puppet is 
"successful". 3. The puppet is shown overcoming difficulties and then succeeding.<br>
Of course, the more dependent, and the lower the self-esteem of the consumer 
the more prone he/she will be to model the behavior of successful puppets. Note 
that this also apply, more generally, to the 'celebrities' hype all over the 
media. The slave masters use vicarious learning for 3 purposes. Puppet's actions 
can be used to create entirely new types of consumer behaviors. Puppets can 
be used to decrease the likelihood that an undesired consumer behavior will 
occur. Puppets can be used to facilitate the occurrence of a previously 
learned consumer behavior.
<p>
<b>Motivation</b><br>
Time to examine what the slave masters call 'motivation'.<bR>
Motivation refers to an activated state within a consumer that leads to the 
goal-directed behavior. It consists of drives, urges, wishes, affect or 
desires that initiate the sequence of events leading to the goal-directed 
behavior. It begins with a stimulus that is processed by the consumer, going 
through the information processing stages of exposure, attention, and 
comprehension. That stimulus can come from inside the consumer or from 
outside the consumer.<br>
Need activation ­ a discrepancy caused when the stimulus processed causes 
the actual state of being to diverge from the desired state. Needs can be 
innate or learned and are never fully satisfied. Needs produce drive states. 
Affect is the central concept behind the experiential perspective of consumer 
behavior. Evidence suggests that even low intensity feelings created by advertisements 
may affect cognition and behavior. Evidence also indicates that consumer responses 
to advertisements have two emotional dimensions ­ positive and negative affect. The 
emotion created can activate a consumer and place the consumer into a drive state.
There's a bias called 'the fundamental attribution error' which is widely used by 
the slave masters: people are unfortunately biased to make internal 
attributions. I.e. they tend wrongly to believe that a person's actions or 
words are caused by that person's true beliefs and preferences, and that 
they are not making  certain statements about a product influenced by 
environmental pressures like the company they work for and the money 
they gain for that. That's another of the reasons behind the use of 
the celebrities puppets and of 'average people', 'good granny', 'old 
dentist', 'cooking grand-ma' or various 'people­on­the­street' interviews 
and ads.
<p>
<b>Psychoanalytic theory and promotional strategy</b><br>
The slave masters, using Psychoanalytic Theory, use symbols and flights 
of fantasy to propel consumers to buy their products. All symbols that exist 
in Psychoanalytic Theory are being used, such as phallic and ovarian symbols, 
for instance, to release sexual energy or libido.
<p>
<b>Product symbolism</b><br>
Products may act as symbols for consumers, expressing a stereotyped "something" 
about their owners. Of course the lower the self-esteem of the consumer the more 
he will view his possessions as extensions of himself.
<hr><fonr color=olive>Wicklund and Gollwitzer observed that people make use of 
material possessions, amongst other strategies, to compensate for perceived 
inadequacies in certain dimensions of their self-concept. For instance, by 
displaying a recognised masculine symbol, such as strutting around in a black 
leather motorbike suit, a young man can compensate for not feeling 'masculine' 
enough by using the object to tell both himself and others that he is indeed 
'masculine'. This compensatory function of material objects obviously entails 
that the 'symbols' have to fit in with a person's gender (amongst other social categories) 
to provide a potential bridge for closing perceived discrepancies 
between actual and ideal dimensions of self.
</font><hr>
 Certain products have 
a self-image/product­image congruence. Example: Automobiles, health products, 
cleaning products, grooming products, leisure products, clothing, retail 
store patronage, food products, cigarettes, home appliances, magazines, home 
furnishings<bR>
All products that consumers use to communicate themselves to others act as 
symbols and have three characteristics. 1. They must have visibility in use 
­ their purchase, consumption, and disposition are readily apparent to others 
2.The product must show variability ­ some consumers have the resources to own 
the product and some do not. 3.The product must have its 'personalizability' ­ 
the extent to which a product denotes a stereotypical image to the average user.
<p>
The LOV (list of values) scale used by the slave masters has 3 dimensions:<bR> 
1.Individual values (self­fulfillment, excitement, sense of accomplishment, and 
self­respect). 2.Focus on the external world (belonging, being well­respected, 
security). 3.Interpersonal orientation (fun and  Enjoyment, warm relationships 
with others).
<p>
<b>Halo effects and imaginary attributes</b><br>
<u>Halo effects</u> occur when consumers assume that because a product is good on 
one product characteristic it is also good on another product characteristic. Example: 
if a consumer believes that crest toothpaste is the best cavity fighting toothpaste, 
he might also belief it has the lowest abrasive qualities. 
<p>
<u>Directing consumers' attention to an existing (or not existing) attribute</u><bR>
Directing consumers' attention to an attribute, and causing them to allocate 
cognitive capacity to the attribute increases the perceived importance of the 
attribute. It doesn't matter in the least if said attribute does not exist. 
Example: in the 80s, burger king convinced consumers that an 
important attribute of fast food hamburgers was the particular method of cooking ­ flame 
broiling . Colgate used for year a non existent additive 'Gardol' (most 
toothpaste and soap advertisements resort to fantastic chemicalfictionist 
constructions)
<p>
<b>Mere exposure phenomenon and behavior</b><br>
Mere exposure phenomenon is a method through which positive feelings may be formed 
through repeated exposures to a stimulus. This is of course not cognitively based, 
as a matter of fact it has no rational motivation whatever: positive feelings from 
repeated exposures can occur without the person consciously knowing or perceiving 
the repetitions or familiarity of the object. The slave masters use mere exposure 
by developing strategies that ensure that the product, its name, or symbol, are 
repeatedly encountered by the consumer, e.g., Coke, Budweiser, since behavior 
formation corresponds to the behavioral influence perspective. In fact behavior 
results from people engaging in behaviors because of environmental or situational 
factors. Example: large retail chains design the physical layout of departments 
within the store to create behavior directly (see +ORC's essay). The entrance to 
a department store may have high status products directly in front of the door 
(jewelry, cosmetics) with sensuously appealing options to the right (lingerie). The 
consumer's first hurdle is to walk past the 'attractive' departments without buying 
anything there.<br>
Physical layout can induce behaviors through aisle arrangement or then use of 
textures, smells and lighting. This is called Atmospherics. Atmospherics are 
"the effort to design buying environments to produce specific emotional effects 
in the buyer that enhance his/her probability of purchase" this is pure pavlovian 
conditioning btw.
<p>
<b>The Fishbein models</b><br>
A mathematical model used by the slave masters (Fishbein)<bR>
The Fishbein attitude­towards­the­object model relies on an algebraic formula 
to explain the decision process consumers actually go through.<bR>
The formula is:<pre> 
Ao = bi x ei
Ao ­ the overall attitude towards the object. 
Bi ­ the belief of whether the object "o" has some particular 'magic' 
     attribute or achieves some particular 'lure' goal. 
Ei ­ the evaluation of the goodness of the attribute to the consumer.
</pre>
Later Fishbein developed another model  (BI = w1 (ab) + w2 (SN)) that 
contains a new construct called the subjective norm which assesses what 
consumers believe other people think they should do, but we don't need 
to get into such details here.
<p>
Ok, how do the slave masters assess if  the promotion was able to influence 
attitudes (i.e.: has the slave's behavior changed after being bombarded)?.<bR>
Usually the consumer is tied into a low­involvement information processing where 
cognitive responses are less likely to occur. Since the consumer is not considering 
the pros and cons of the issue, he uses peripheral cues (attractiveness and expertise 
of the source, the number of arguments presented, positive or negative stimuli 
in message context, music, etc.) to determine acceptance or rejection of the 
message. Research has indicated that using peripheral cues, such as the physical 
attractiveness of a model as an endorser, had great impact on consumers. 
Companies attempt to create a unit relation between the endorser and the brand 
(x) by 1. Hiring puppets who are supposed experts (or seen as experts) in using 
the product, 2.Signing the endorser to long­term, exclusive contracts so that 
the celebrity puppet is associated only with the same company's brand, 3.Having 
the puppet consistently wear or use the product when in public to strengthen 
the association with the product.
<p>
<b>Techniques of ingratiation (Lying)</b><br>
Ingratiation tactics.<br>
These are self­serving tactics engaged in by one person to make him/herself more 
attractive to another. As the attractiveness of 1 person increases, the likelihood 
of another complying with his/her wishes increases, this is a very subtle way of 
obtaining increased power over another person.<br>
Ingratiation efforts are manipulative and calculating.<bR> 
Appearing to be similar to the target ­ the ingratiator appraises the target person's 
attitudes, opinions, and interests and modifies his/her statements to match the 
perceived beliefs of the other<br>
Conforming to the target's wishes ­ making the target feel important<br>
Offering compliments, and gifts ­ rewards for the target.<br>
Expressing liking ­ the target is likely to return the liking<br> 
Asking advice ­ makes the target feel respected.<br>
Ingratiation techniques are used in personal selling situations, yet a 
problem occurs if the target gets wise to the techniques , since even easy targets feel 
manipulated if that happens :o)
<p> 
The foot-in­the­door technique.<bR>
To increase the likelihood of a prospect saying yes to a moderate request, a person may 
ask for a smaller request first. By saying yes to the first, small request, the person may 
agree to the second request to maintain consistency with self­perception. This technique 
has been used most frequently to increase response rate to market research surveys. 
<p>
The 'Istanbul bazaar' technique<bR> 
This is the opposite of the foot­in­the­door technique. The initial request is very 
large ­ large enough that no one could be expected to comply with it. It is then 
followed by a smaller, more reasonable request. This technique relies on the norm 
of reciprocity. The norm of reciprocity states if a person does something for you, 
you should do something in return for that person. Illicitly invoking the norm, the 
requester makes a large request (although never expecting compliance) then appears 
to give up something by making a smaller request. The target then feels as though he 
or she must return the favor 
 <p>
Even­a­penny­will­help technique.<br> 
This technique is based on the tendency for people to want to make themselves 
"look good." Since everyone has a penny, one would look foolish to say no to 
the request. The target cannot simply give a penny without looking foolish. The 
target tends to give whatever is appropriate for the situation. 
<p>
Inherent in all 4 techniques is the attempt by an influencer to manipulate 
another by engaging in subtle subterfuge. Remember a simple truth: in using 
the techniques, the influencer is always lying.
<p>
<b>"Persuasion"</b><br>
Ultimately communications are given to persuade.<bR> 
Persuasion is a process in which a communication is delivered in order to change 
beliefs and/or attitudes in a desired manner.<br>
The match­up hypothesis indicates that endorsers who match­up with the product 
on relevant attributes may be more effective regardless of their likability. Example: 
Karl Malden played a TV cop for many years. He is an effective spokesperson in 
explaining the warnings against carrying a lot of cash instead of the American 
Express card. Yet if  they use a source that is perceived as overexposed ­ the 
audience understands that the source has been bought off.
<p>
<b>Fear appeals</b><br>
Fear appeals communicate the message that unfortunate circumstances will result 
if the consumer fails to use a particular product or service. Fear appeals (Hitler's 
and all religious fanatics' methods) are effective at producing attitude change 
when the message contains one or 
more of the following types of information: Specific instructions on how to cope 
with and reduce the fear. An indication that following the instructions will solve 
the problem. Giving a high­fear message to an audience that feels highly 
threatened and vulnerable to the threat. A supposed solution to the problem 
can be quickly presented. Fear appeals can be effective by creating emotional 
responses that focus attention on how to cope with a supposed problem giving 
for acquainted the problem without questioning it.
<p>
<b>Primacy and recency effects</b><br> 
Primacy effect occurs when material early in the message has the most 
influence. Recency effect occurs when material at the end of the message 
has the most influence. Information in the middle of a message is relatively 
poorly remembered and has the least impact.
<p>
<b>Repetition effects</b><br> 
This refers to how much repetition is enough and how much is too much (advertising 
wear­out).  Usually the slave masters believe that 3 exposures should be sufficient 
to dumb the consumer and 4 would be too much. In fact even among the lowest forms 
of TV-watching drooling beings, counter arguments increase as the number of 
repetitions increase, causing attitudes toward the ad to become (very slowly) 
more negative. In order to avoid negative reactions due to boredom, the slave 
masters try to vary the same ad with each repetition to avoid wear­out.
<p>
<b>Representativeness heuristic</b><br> 
The representativeness heuristic is a rule of thumb in which a person determines 
the probability that "object a" belongs to "class b" by assessing the degree that 
object a is similar or stereotypical of class b. "knock­off" brands that have 
names and packaging similar to leading brands make use of this heuristic. There 
are at least twenty macaroni producers in Europe that use purposely (almost) the 
same blue boxes as the universally famous Italian "Pasta Barilla".
<p>
<b>Time scales</b><br> 
Because people tend to discount the psychological value of the future loss 
and having the good now is so important, a consumer might pay a higher price 
in the future to have the good in the present ­ the delay­payment effect. If a 
consumer "just missed" a sale, he will feel more of a loss than if the sale 
was 6 months prior. Consumer self­control refers to the ability of people to 
delay gratification and avoid making purchases that provide pleasure in the 
present but pain in the future.
<p>
<b>Frequency heuristic</b><br> 
The frequency heuristic occurs when choice is influenced by the mere number of 
positive and negative attributes associated with a brand, or by the mere number 
of dimensions on which one brand outperforms another. Consumers act as though 
they simply count the number of features on which one brand surpasses 
another ­ little or no attention paid to the relative importance of the 
features. The slave masters utilize this heuristic when they provide 
buyers with a series of extra gifts for a purchase to increase the perceived 
number of benefits, e.g., fragrance companies that offer a "$60" make­up 
case with the purchase of a $40 bottle of perfume.
<p>
<b>Decision makers' bending</b><br> 
Marketers can sometimes bend the decision maker's frame, e.g., meat that 
is "75% lean" as opposed to meat that is 25% fat. "Best before" as opposed 
to 'Do not consume after' and so on...
<p>
<b>Impulse purchases</b><br>
Purchases made with no cognitive control in an automatic manner. It is the 
antithesis of rational consumption.<bR>
Clear symptom of a successful strategy implemented by the slave 
masters. It's defined as a buying action undertaken without a problem 
having been previously recognized or a buying intention formed prior 
to entering the store ­ a spur of the moment decision based on positive 
feelings toward an object, it's in reality the effect of some of the 
techniques used by the slave masters and explained above. There are some 
defenses against this, the main one being the very old trick of NEVER 
buying anything that you didn't list on paper before leaving your 
house... whatever your mind keeps telling you :o)
<hr><font color=olive>
Impulse buying constitutes a substantial 'non-rational' segment of purchasing 
behaviour, which can assume 
such excessive proportions that individuals find themselves in considerable 
financial debt and psychological distress. Empirical studies on 'shopping 
addiction' or 'compulsive buying' have been carried out recently in the 
United States (e.g., Friese and Koenig, 1993; O'Guinn and Faber, 1989; 
Hanley and Wilhelm, 1992), Canada (e.g., Valence, d'Astous, and 
Fortier, 1988), Germany (e.g., Scherhorn, Reisch and Raab, 1990; 
Reisch and Scherhorn, 1994) and the United Kingdom (e.g., Elliott, 
1994). All suggest that extreme impulse (compulsive) buying is on 
the increase, affecting an estimated 5% to 10% of the adult population, 
and that at least occasional bouts of impulse buying are much more common 
than that. Scherhorn, et al. (1990) describe 25% of German adults as 
showing some mild compulsive shopping tendencies.

<b>Group psychology</b><br>
I won't enter too much in this huge field. Suffice to note that there are two main 
groups used scientifically for consumer enslaving purposes: <u>Aspiration groups</u>: those 
sets of people to whom a consumer wishes to belong and <u>Dissociative groups</u>: 
those sets of people from which the consumer hopes to separate.<br>
To explain this, remember that in a group there are <u>roles</u> and that a "role­related" 
product cluster is a set of products necessary for playing a particular role inside an aspiration 
group: An example is given by a "business person's" suit, expensive pen, 
expensive attache case, secretary, etc.<bR>Note also how people that ARE REALLY part 
of the 'aspiration group' (real rich people, real businessmen, real celebrities etc.) 
often refuse the 'role-related' product clusters ("real rich" despising  
any "Lacoste crocodile"  (even to the point of  
sewing it off their T-shirts) or any similar mass-consumer logos, for instance.<br>
One more observation about any "age groups" subdivision: 
Elder "Mature consumers" group members feel always <u>younger</u> than they actually are, 
while "teenagers" feel always <u>older</u> than they actually are... the 
implication is that all slave master's promotional materials focus 
on portraying both elderly and youngsters at the age <u>they feel</u> not, 
their chronological age (with clear and dangerous implications: fast cars, 
cigarettes, booze, etc.). 
<p>
<b>"Don't waste a second without consuming"</b><br>
Distribution systems have more and more 'flexibilized' their opening times.<br>  
Nowadays you can consume something else in the middle of the night, should you 
feel that you have not consumed enough during the day. This is also perfectly in line 
with the increasingly successful struggle of the slave masters in order 
to destroy any 'Sunday' 
(intended as the only one day 'without consume') in the name of 'rationalization' 
and 'globalisation' 
and 'progress' and 'more flexibility'. In reality the existence of the simple concept 
of a 'Sunday' (man! a whole day WITHOUT consuming!) is a blasphemy for the slave 
masters: kids 
and grown up slaves could eventually come to the idea that consuming 
is after all NOT so important.<br> 
Hence the growing push -everywhere- in order that retail stores can be open weekends and 
evenings (a trend feebly countered by obsolete churches or almost destroyed 
worker unions, NOT countered by any 
mass media or 'opinion leader'). At the same time 
Mail­order purchasing has increased in "popularity". People are so conditioned that 
they simply NEED to buy something during those long terrible TV-ads filled 
Sunday afternoons, and mail-ordering 
gives them at least the 'good feeling' that they are not condemned to endure a 
whole day without 
throwing some more money away :o)
<p>
<b>Rituals</b><br>
In our society goods are able to carry and communicate "cultural" meanings to individuals.<bR>
The transfer of meaning from consumer goods to individuals may 
take place through various rituals, including possessions, 
exchange, grooming and divestment rituals.<br>
Certain rituals or symbolic actions link people to material 
goods ('forced' exchanges at birthdays and 'forced' presents at 
Christmas).<bR>
A typical (negative and alarming) symptom of the decay of the society we live in 
can easily be seen just examining the evolution of print advertising <u>themes</u> 
during the last 10 years:  
<u>Utilitarian themes</u> (where a product's benefits were described in terms of 
practicality and efficiency) have dramatically decreased and <u>Luxury themes</u> 
increased dramatically (where having the possession is <u>the end in 
itself</u>, a destructive activity that 
leads -and is motivated- by the  "cultural" meanings of envy, possessiveness, 
selfishness and greed). 
<p>
<b>Trends</b><br>
Trends (the "<b>slave masters' whips</b>", as +ORC called them) have such an importance that 
apparel companies had to introduce clothing for working women that does not go 
"out of style" each year. If you observe this kind of clothing you will notice 
a very interesting series of "no-no-frill" common (functional) characteristics. 
As a simple rule of 
thumb, the more of these characteristics carries <u>your own</u> clothing, the less 
probably it will 'look' obsolete during the next 5-7 years (not that you could care 
less about that, I know, but nevertheless... :o)

<b>Hope for the future?</b><br>
OK, this all said, there are some (small) signs of relief. I'll list some of them:<bR>
1) Advertisement is more and more frowned upon. This is a consequence, <i>inter alia</i> 
of the development of the telecommunication market and of the Web itself.<br>Clearly once 
you know that you can get a cellular phone  FOR 
FREE if you decide to listen to some advertisement while you'r using it (Berliner experiment 
in Germany, Sweden, Benelux experiments, 
now elsewhere too) you may decide to get it for free, but you (and anybody else) begin to realize 
at the same time that 'publicity and advertisements' are for poor people and lusers, real 
rich can AFFORD not to have to listen/see to any advertisement.<bR>
The mere promotion of all these 'free in exchange of ads' campaigns (email addresses on the web, cellular 
phones, television channels etceteras) contributes therefore to the more and more perceived 
truth that 'advertisements are for slaves and lusers' (as they in fact are, btw) and to a growing 
refusal of the same advertisement if there's nothing (or <i>not enough</i>) in exchange...<br>
2) The main "segmentation" purpose of the slave masters' strategy (always trying to identify 
<u>target groups</u> that have divergent time pressures, characteristics or 'gullibility', 
or targeting certain household segments in order to 
deliver product designs that should meet AT THE SAME TIME the time needs, characteristics or gullibility 
of diverse segments) means that the final product will NOT be able to really satisfy well 
the (perceived) needs of anyone of 
the different segments and will therefore just be a minimal common denominator for many and 
not 'the best possible solution' for each one (hence a general bad mood -even among 
slaves- when indulging in useless consuming). This can of course be exploited and reversed 
by us.<br>
