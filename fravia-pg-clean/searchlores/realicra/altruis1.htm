                 <p><i>Well, there's a long story behind this... Depp dt has a nice 
'reality cracking' site on the web (I don't publish it because he did not ask for it, yet all 
good net seekers will be able to find it) and I did not publish some of his 
previous essays because I had the impression that they were too much 'passionate' and 
(maybe I'm wrong) IMO a real "reality cracking" essay should be always "cool" and should 
avoid the tragical (and comical) 
destiny of weird nerds everywhere: taking themselves too seriously. So I didn't publish 
some previous essays, but I am publishing this one... and I hope somebody else will 
BUILD on this in order to get a more correct (or should I say a more 'reversed'?) 
evaluation of our conditioning patterns.</i></center>

                 * - altruism, giving without any personal benefit.
                 <P>
                 In Britain, and quite possibly worldwide(?), students are actually
                 taught
                 at colleges and universities that altruism does not exist. It happened
                 to
                 me when I did my degree some time ago and it happened to a friend taking
                 his degree last year. I think that it's taught to new students before
                 they
                 are practiced at analysing an argument and before they are encouraged to
                 have their own opinions and to argue with their lecturers. It is
                 presented
                 as accepted, objective fact without a real opportunity to disagree. 
                 <P>
                 The argument goes like this. Social Psychology's 'reward theory' states
                 that for every act of giving, there is an equivalent 'value' received in
                 return so there can never be altruism because the giver always receives
                 something of equal value. Just search the net on altruism and I'm sure
                 that
                 you'll see the argument. The trouble with the argument which seems lost
                 on
                 the academics is that it's a totally 'tautological' or circular
                 argument -
                 you are within the argument - it can't be disproved because of the way
                 it's
                 stated. Now, if the argument was stated that altruism does exist, that
                 there is never such a thing as an equal exchange - that could not ever
                 be
                 disproved either.
                 <P>
                 Let's take an example. I'm on a crowded bus and I give up my seat to
                 allow
                 a pregnant woman to sit. Now according to 'reward theory', I didn't do
                 this
                 because I am willing to help strangers when I'm able to and when it's
                 fairly easy to do so. No, I received from this 'exchange', good feelings
                 for myself equal to the value of the effort expended. What nonsense, but
                 the trouble is I'm within the argument which ASSUMES that a trade occurs
                 and defines the reward in terms of that trade.
                 <P>
                 To disprove this theory, people are forced to find an example where
                 there
                 is obviously no reward for the 'altruism'. The normal example is the
                 anonymous kidney donor. Oh no, say the reward theorists, he receives a
                 kidney's-worth of good feelings. And any other example you think about,
                 freeware, helping a blind person across the road, anything at all. The
                 point is that <B>the theory is based on the assumption that it's innate
                 for
                 people to trade</B>. It supports the dominant Capitalist ideology and
                 states that you don't and can't do anything for nothing and that
                 everything
                 has it's price. 
                 <P>
                 Is there any hope for humanity if we teach and are taught that we cannot
                 relate to each other than on this basis?. The implications are quite
                 horrendous - that the concept of charity does not exist, that economic
                 aid
                 requires an economic return (which is often the case in practice) but I
                 think the main point is that we are being taught to be fantastically
                 selfish - worse than that - we are being taught that there is no other
                 way
                 except to be fantastically selfish, individualistic and self-centered.
                 <P>
                 By accepting this teaching we are transformed into individual consuming
                 units. Individual consuming units are important because they mean
                 greater
                 demand for consumer products. However, they also mean loneliness,
                 solitude
                 and alienation from others. Can you really love someone on this basis? I
                 think that it was Caesar who originally developed the theory of divide
                 and
                 conquer ...<BR>
