<H2>Common propaganda techniques</h2>
<H3>(applied reversing in the context of  the NATO aggression<a href="natoagr1.htm#aggr">*</a> of Yugoslavia)</h3>

By fravia+ (April 1999 ~ in fieri ~ version 003)
</center><hr>
<b>1. Introduction</b><p>
Since this script is intended for a "mature" audience (i.e., readers that are -or should be-
able to discern propaganda patterns in order to practice their reality cracking skills), let's
put immediately out of the way some useless "pavlovian reaction" patterns. I hope not to be
annoyed by people
accusing me of being either filo-serbian or filo-NATO. I'm not: I'm convinced that both
Milosevic and Clinton are corrupt criminals, a statement that seems pretty evident to me not
only in the context of this war, and -moreover- I strongly believe that <u>all soldiers</u> are
killers ("Soldaten sind m�rder", a beautiful and very precise reversing statement by Kurt
Tuckholsky).
<p>
Let's also, please, put aside the obvious truths <bR> <b>1) </b>that the Serbian and the
Kossovars are both
practicing ethnic cleansing (like everyone else nowadays... and not only in the
Balcans);<br><b>2) </b>
that NATO has waged an aggression
war without any legal or democratic justification whatsoever (and given itself 
the right to attack sovereign nations at whim); <bR><b>3) </b> that after four
weeks of
bombing the military, strategical and political incompetence of the NATO forces is evident from
Lissabon to Novosibirsk; and that
<br><b>4) </b> that the real victims of this war are mostly Serbian <b>and</b> Kossovars
women, children and elderly.

<p>
What I'm concerned with is the propagandistic aspect of this war.
I'll analyze some English-speaking newspapers only, because I cannot understand Serbo-Croatian
(else I would have gladly analyzed the Serbian propaganda as well). Note that I tried to introduce some 
aspects of Serbian propaganda where I could find some english speaking fonts. I hope that 
Serbian readers will send me an investigation of their country's own propaganda patterns.<br>German,
French, Italian (or whatever) readers could also send me short lists of the main adjectives
used on their media to describe the 'resilient dictator Milosevic' and those 'slaughtering and
killing serbs', with their 'terror tactics'.<br>
It would also be useful to collect the main paraphrases used to describe those "heroic
aviators" and "law enforcers" which are "trying to carry out a mission to save 
the refugee's lives" bombing people around in the Balcans. A list of all euphemisms used in the 
various european languages (see the 'collateral damages' part of this essay) would, 
I'm sure, be quite interesting as well.<p>
I don't need to point out that, in the tradition of my site, this kind of work will florish if 
people will contribute reversing on their own: building on each other's shoulders we will 
send another snowball downhill :-)<hr width=44%>
<b>Caveats</b><br>
Since I'll analyse the NATO-propaganda, this script will <b>seem</b> biased towards the Serbian
part. There's unfortunately no way to avoid it (short of knowing Serbo-Croatian and
performing an analogouos exercise on their propaganda). I don't care much, since I believe
the NATO-Governments to be (and not only in this context) hypocritical criminals exactly
as much as the Serbian one probably is (though I admit to lack any direct experience there),
so I don't believe I'm betraying anyone, quite the countrary... in any war the real
act of courage is to disert, and if, as I agree, "soldiers are killers",  then
"disertors are heroes".<p>
Anyway the duty of a reverser is to reverse. And -as you will see- this "schm�tzig NATO/Serbia-krieg" 
will offer us plenty of material to flex our reversing muscles.

<p><b>
2) It's all propaganda, don't doubt it for a minute
</b><p>
A great danger, when examining propaganda material, is a sort of 'subliminal contamination', a slow grip 
that that same material is getting onto you, notwithstanding all your reverser' defences. So let's 
not forget for a minute that all what we are been told about this event (as usual) is just 
propagandistic crap. To dig out some small truths requires, as you'll see, a lot of reversing 
stamina.<p>

On 19/4/99 Joe Lockhart, the White House spokesman, told reporters at a Washington briefing to
be
"<font color=blue>more skeptical</fonT>" of Belgrade's claims. Reacting to suggestions that he, too, was engaged in
propaganda, Mr. Lockhart said that he was trying "<font color=blue>to put the best face on things, but Belgrade
is simply engaged in outright lies about developments on the ground</font>".
<p>
This very interesting statement puts us straight in the middle of the question: while our
side tries to 'put the best face on things', the enemy is 'engaged in outright lies'.
<p>
You could also read the following on the Herald Tribune:<br>
"Losing the information war is a prime concern in Brussels. For several weeks, NATO has been
sustained by moral outrage over ragged refugees on the run from slaughter. Support for the
allied assault is high in most Western countries. But recent days delivered a double whammy of
adverse images: 10 civilians killed in a passenger train bombed by NATO and the tractor convoy
bombing Wednesday. '<font color=blue>Milosevic hopes he can soak up punishment, and through outrage over
collateral damage, he can win the propaganda campaign</font>', a NATO diplomat said".
<p>
"...through outrage over collateral damage", we will find this 'collateral damage' again in
the Euphemisms section below. But the "soak up punishment" part is also a masterpiece of
propaganda. Goebbels would be proud of this unnamed NATO-diplomat.
<p>
Do not underestimate the importance of propaganda in this context: as the Economist (351: 24/30 April) reports:<br><br> 
"<font color=blue>To most people in the main western democracies, the reports from Kosovo of torture, rape, looting and 
summary killings are so horrific that defeating Belgrade has seemed more important than any nicety 
of international law or diplomatic precedent</font>".<p>
This short period is a masterpiece of the deceiving art: a real truth hidden beneath (at least) 
three layers of rhetoric, and I'll let to the reader the pleasure (or 
rather the sad task) to reverse it. You will find hidden above <u>quite a lot</u> of keys (apart from "most", 
"report", "seem", "nicety" and "precedent").



<p>
<b>
3) Testimonials and Fear appeals
</b><p>
Testimonials usually represent the sugar-coating of a distortion, a falsehood, a misunderstood
notion.
The most common misuse of the testimonial involves citing individuals who are not qualified to
make judgments about a particular issue. Why should we regard this person as having trustworthy
information on the subject in question?
<p>
"<font color=blue>Refugees fleeing Kosovo are reporting to relief workers that Yugoslav helicopters and
airplanes have been attacking refugee convoys in the Serbian province, a Pentagon official
said.</fonT>" (Herald Tribune)
<p>
Now, the problem is that when you see an old man 'from Kossovo' lying in an 'Albanian' hospital
with a burned face, you are probably keen to believe that he barely escaped a 'serbian death
squadron', especially if he (seems to) say that. But there's no real proof whatsoever that what
he's saying is true, other that the fact that he's saying it and that he seems in very bad
conditions.  Note, that I'm not saying that he's in an Hollywood studio wearing tomatoes
make-up, in fact, everything he claims could really be true: the point is that the whole thing
is used for propaganda purposes, not in order to establish what happened, what if the
'helicopters and airplanes' were NATO's ones? (in fact much more probable given the air
superiority relations). Did the 'old man from Kossovo' recognize the markings of the attacking
planes, and would he have been interviewed if he really had?
<p>
Fear is a very strong propaganda method ("All other things being equal, the more frightened a
person is by a communication, the more likely her or she is to take positive preventive action"
- Pratkanis and Aronson, 1991), Fear appeals are more likely to succeed in changing behavior if
they contain specific
recommendations for reducing the threat that the audience believes are both effective and
doable. There are four elements to a successful fear appeal: 1) a threat, 2) a specific
recommendation about how the audience should behave, 3) audience perception that the
recommendation will be effective in addressing the threat, and 4) audience perception that they
are capable of performing the recommended behavior.
<p>
When confronted with persuasive messages that capitalize on our fear, we should ask ourselves
the following questions:<ul><li>
Is the speaker exaggerating the fear or threat in order to obtain my support?<li>
How legitimate is the fear that the speaker is provoking?<li>
Will performing the recommended action actually reduce the supposed threat?<li>
When viewed dispassionately, what are the merits of the speaker's proposal?</li></uL>
<p>
The heavy use of testimonials must of course be accompanied by the discrediting of all
testimonials used by the adverse part. Here, after having reported a "serbian diffused"
propaganda interview with an hospital patient in Belgrad, a very curious comment by the Herald
Tribune: "<font color=blue>Belgrade had added another civilian casualty story in the propaganda war with the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and ordinary Serbs had been strengthened in their belief
that they - not the government of President Slobodan Milosevic - are the real victims of the
three-week-old bombing campaign against their country.</font>"
<p>Some reversing work is needed here, and it is very instructive to 
confront this with the "old man from Kossovo" story above.
<p><b>
4) Euphemisms
</b><p>
As all reversers (should) know, euphemisms are particularly abundant during wars. This has,
obviously, to do with the fact that wars are particularly unpleasant, since people tend to get
killed for very 'low' strategical scopes which vanish more and more into the background of the
'holy' cause the country you happen to fight for (or you just happen to live into) appears to
follow.
<p>
Note how -not so many years ago- the 'propagandistic' aspect was significantly less strong,
when you had also a Ministry (or a department) of war (and not a ministry, or department, 'of
defense'). Hence also missiles named 'peacekeeper' (an oxymoron if I ever saw one), traumatized
people suffering of 'combat fatigue' or of 'post-traumatic stress disorders' and so on.
<p>
'Collateral damages' seem to be one of the preferred euphemisms in this war.
<p>
Ah, yes: we have 'civilian casualties', as well, but those are always provoked by the other
side.
<p>
"<font color=blue>We know that civilian casualties are the objective of President Milosevic's policies</fonT>"<br>
(James Rubin, the State Department spokesman).
<p>
And no,  still "<u>collateral damages</u>"... if seen from the Yugoslavian side:<p>
Vladislav Jovanovic (Yugoslavia's ambassador to the UN, October 1998, speaking 
about Yugoslavian repression in Kossovo): "<font color=blue>there is not any action or repression
against civilians by our forces. Our operation there exclusively centered and concentrated
against terrorists and their accomplices - it is possible that some <b>collateral damages</b> could
happen, and some civilians could be a reality, but it has never been done intentionally.</fonT>"
<p>
<b>
5) The case of the refugees bombing: screaming propaganda.
</b><p>
Since NATO pilots are bombing from more than 4,5 kilometers altitude, a series of 'collateral
damages' have obviously been pre-programmed. The most embarrassing blunder so far has been the
bombing of a convoy of the same refugees that the whole propaganda machine is supposed to
sanctify. The reactions of the killers as soon as this happened are extremely interesting:
<p><b>
First reaction:</b><bR>
It was not us, but the enemy that did it.
<p>
Kenneth Bacon, the Pentagon spokesman, said that General Wesley Clark, the top NATO commander,
had received ''verbal reports of the possibility'' that, after military vehicles in the refugee
convoy were hit, ''military people got out'' and ''began to attack civilians in the middle of
the convoy.'' (Herald Tribune).
<p><b>
Second reaction:</b><br>
It could have been us, but do not jump to any conclusion.
<p>
A NATO spokesman, Jamie Shea, acknowledged that ''military vehicles'' had been a target
Wednesday afternoon on the Prizren-Djakovica road in western Kosovo. He added that NATO was
trying to establish whether the convoy had been hit by mistake. ''We are processing the battle
damage assessment,'' he said. ''I would not jump to any conclusions until we've had a chance to
make an assessment,'' he said. ''Reserve judgment until we have the facts.'' Mr. Bacon said the
incident Wednesday was being investigated, which he said ''may take some time.'' ''We did hit
military vehicles in a convoy,'' he said. ''We are quite sure we hit only military vehicles. We
will obviously review what happened.'' (Herald Tribune)

<p><b>
Third reaction:</b><br>
OK, it was us, but it was it was "an error occurred on the part of someone trying to carry out
a mission to save lives", not an 'atrocity': the real culprits are -of course- the enemies:
<p>
U.S. defense secretary, William Cohen (who has a grotesque sense of the grotesque):  "<font color=blue>For him
(Milosevic) to talk in terms of atrocities
when in fact he has caused the displacement and the refugee status of in excess of a million
people, where he has sent in 40,000 of his military, paramilitary, police, hooded thugs to
savagely kill and slaughter at random and on a wholesale basis these innocent people, for him
to talk about atrocities when <b>an error occurred on the part of someone trying to carry out a
mission to save their lives</b>, I think is one of the most grotesque statements that I could
conceive of.</font>"
<p>
Incredible but true. As if readers were zombies.
<p>
<b>Conclusion</b><br>
The propaganda machine that has been started is a main component of this dirty NATO/Serbian war.<br>
This same machine is now (after 4 weeks of bombing) running amok, as this snippet from 
"The Economist" (351: 24/30 April) testifies:<br> 
<font color=blue>And now, having tried -so far with disastrous results- to stop the Serb 
atrocities by launching an air war, the alliance faces widespread criticism round the world for 
failing to get a licence from the United Nations and thus breaking international law</font>.
<br>It would be difficoult -I believe- to find a more convolute 
(still propagandistic) statement to underline some obvious truths, 
a pleasure to reverse.
<p>
Our task, I believe, should be to study the <u>guts</u> of the propaganda machine 
(of course -if possible- on both 
sides) in order to learn, to understand and eventually -a far day from now 
I'm afraid- to be able to retaliate in
 the name of humanity. It is important to differentiate among those that are employed by the slavemasters to tame the 
zombies with writings and images: in fact  
there are "criminals", "responsables" and "gullible ones".  
What really amazes me is that 
there are incredibly few that dare point out some pretty obvious "inconsistencies". Seems like 
money plays a greater role than truth for writers and journalists :-)<bR>It 
would be quite interesting if all readers, in the States, in Germany, in Serbia, in Danemark 
and wherever, would work a little on their own media and send their own findings.
<br>
There is 
no mistery in the art of deceiving people, of course.<br> 
The great mystery is how so easily this is done and why so few care that it 
is being done. Anyway we are not discovering anything new...<bR>

"<i>Woe unto you, ...hypocrites! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of 
the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess</i> " Matthew 23:25.
<p>
This work is still <i>in fieri</i> exactly as the war against Serbia is. Nato plans have 
been very well expressed by Clinton:
"<font color=blue>Our plan is to persist until we prevail</font>".
<p>
Those should be valid plans for all reversers as well :-)

<a name="aggr"></a><b>Aggression"</b>: <i>n.</i> An unprovoked attack by one country against another<br>
<br>I have received quite a lot of emails about this article. Some people pointed out to me that 
the use of the term "aggression" for the title gave automatically 
to my essay a pro-Serbian bias. I'm afraid I cannot come to terms with this. An aggression 
is an aggression following valid international right, no matter how strong the 
current propaganda machine would like to hide it. Reversers should (try to) use terms in 
an "emotion free" manner, and should also (try to) <u>read</u> in an emotion free manner. Note 
that I refrained from writing a couple of small Limericks on the "old man of Kossovo", though :-)
