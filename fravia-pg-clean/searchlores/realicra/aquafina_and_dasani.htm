<center><font size=+2><i>...for most european consumers, the idea of some bottled 
tap water sold as a "real" spring mineral water would definitely be on the top list of scams. 
Well, rejoice: 
it has been common 
practice in the States during the last ten years,
 and the slavemasters are now trying the same scam in the European Union...

Let's repeat the obvious<br></center> 
<a href="http://images.google.com/images?client=opera&rls=en&q=aquafina&btnG=Search+Images">Aquafina</a> is 
just bottled tap water (by Pepsi) which is sold in almost all supermarkets and 
served by many restaurants in the States.<br>
<a href="http://images.google.com/images?svnum=100&hl=en&rls=en&q=dasani&btnG=Search+Images">Dasani</a> is just bottled tap water (by Coca Cola) which is sold in almost all supermarkets and  
served by many restaurants in the States.<br> 
You want more examples? There is also an european (Nestle) scam going on in the States: 
"Nestle Pure Life" 
(now this has been somehow mixed with the 
even more deceiving name "Poland Spring". This is indeed 
a spring water resort in Maine, near Fryeburg)<br>Selling tap water 
is like shooting at the red cross: you open a bottling factory and can automagically sell some 
 0.03 cents half litre water for one euro. "<i>Go forth and screw the zombies</i>"  
<br><bR>It is worth mentioning that in the States such scam "tap mineral waters" have indeed 
an "historical" <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i>:
when, in the nineties, Perrier and Evian (a name which inverted means "Na&iuml;ve", btw) 
invaded the States with their (real and expensive) 
"spring" mineral waters, the two main US-conglomerates, Coke and Pepsi, had to 
react and -since the best defence is always an attack-  managed to pull through such 
most incredible scam: <font color=blue>let's convince our own consumers to pay us 
an extra price 
for their own tap water</font>.
<br><br>
<center>
<br>The Bromate concoction<br>
</center><br>



Note that this is not just an US-matter: the Dasani scam of "bottled tap water" 
was actually already launched (and sold) some years ago in Europe (at least in the United Kingdom, 
which -to a certain extent- pretends to be part of Europe  :-), but has been -thanks Godzilla- 
subsequently  
 recalled, due to its high percentage of carcinogen 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bromate">Bromate</a>.<br> 
<br>In fact, in London, Coke  was tapping its Dasani crap from   
 <u>unpurified Thames water</u> (by itself free of Bromate) but added for "taste profile" 
 a batch of calcium chloride, which contains bromide.<br> 
 Then alas, following a common practice in the States, they pumped ozone through it, 
 thus oxidising the innoquous bromide into bromate - which is 
 a carcinogenical and dangerous substance. 
 <br>Hence it is easy to see how such "bottled tap waters" are not only obvious scams, 
 but can also 
 represent quite dangerous crap concoctions.<br>
 Personally, I fail to see the logic of killing the very zombies that fall for your 
 bogus advertisement... but I guess 
 that some commercial gain must exist somewhere even in this case. <bR>
 <br>Anyway the advertisement terminology 
 is in itself  
 quite sarcastic, come to think of it: 
 "<font color=blue>Aquafina: So Pure, We Promise Nothing</font>". Hehe. Well said.<br><br>
 It is worth noting that 
 Coca-Cola sells annually more than 300 million cases of Dasani around the world. This proves, 
 in spades,  
 that "Consumers are morons" and, incidentally,  that advertisement is much too powerful in a society where kids 
 are -on purpose- not tought any more the basic <a href="exegesis.htm">exegesis</a> and rhetoric skills,
  in order to enable them to defend themselves against the slavemasters.
 <bR><br><center>Less healty, more expensive
</center>
 
 <br> To conclude, 
 using simpler words, Dasani and all "tap" mineral waters  <font color=blue>are 
 less healthy than regular tap water, yet at more than thirty times the price</font>.
 <br><br>
 It should be also noted that Coke tried to launch Dasani in France and other european countries 
 as well. But with 
 a quite remarkable difference: Coca Cola pointed out in their advertisements 
 that "<i>Unlike the UK or the States, 
 the variety of Dasani to be sold in France is a genuine mineral water</i>". Imho this sounds 
 rather insulting vis-&agrave;-vis the english and american consumers&nbsp;:-)
 
 <br><br>
 Note that, apart the Bromate scam, in most cities, regular tap water is anyway "better" than mineral water 
 (both tapped AND spring water) from 
any and all hygienical points of view: in fact after a coupla weeks 
in a plastic bottle, any kind of mineral 
water will taste pretty stale. Not to mention the many other 
ecological considerations: the beverage industry adds 
a bazillion of tons of plastic to all landfills and uses much 
too much energy by producing and shipping the crap bottles.<br>Yet consumers, all over the world, 
have been drilled to prefer to drink such bottles of "mineral water" 
(paying an extra price and being compelled to carry home 
the weight) 
 after being bombarded by very expensive and orchestrated advertisement campaigns. 
<bR>For more details see +ORC's old (1997: yet still valid) "<a href="modernze.htm">Mineral 
Water</a>" reality cracking essay.
<br><br>
Pepsi launched its Aquafina "bottled tap water" brand in 1997 and Coke quickly responded 
with its own "bottled tap water", called Dasani.<br>
It worked, thanks to the incredible zombification level of most american consumers: 
believe it or not, these "bottled tap water" products 
are now the #1 and #2 bestsellers in the States... incredible but, alas, true.<br>
Many restaurants in the States serve now either Aquafina or Dasani <u>only</u>.
 And try asking the waiter for some real 
tap water... he  
will probably be quite rude to you.
<br><br><center>A legitimate question</center><br> 
<i>Is it just bottled tap water or is there some 'added value' to be found, as they claim?</i> 
<bR>Well, in fact, here's a legitimate answer to such a legitimate question: bottled 
tap water  is
just a complete, absolute, utterly, gigantic, galactic scam: for instance, 
 what the various firms describe as "highly sophisticated purification process", 
 (Dasani: "<i>based on Nasa spacecraft technology</i>"), is 
 just a simple "reverse osmosis" filter, the same approach 
 used in many popular (and cheap) domestic water purification units.
<br><br>
Note also the visual deceiving approach: the 'Aquafina' logo is a 
line of mountains against the sunset: <i>Il danno e la beffa</i>.<bR>Coke, on the other hand, 
had already invented a "Dasani plus" collection of "flavoured tap water": "Kiwi Strawberry" Flavor, 
 "Pomegranate Blackberry" Flavor and  "Orange Tangerine" Flavor.<bR>  
 Pepsi  introduced  Aquafina "FlavorSplash" in 
 "Raspberry", "Citrus Blend" and "Wild Berry" flavors, while  
 Aquafina "Sparkling (tap) water" has been produced in "Original", "Lemon-Lime" and "Berry" varieties.
<br><br>
<center>A nice exercise for the reader</center>
<br>
As a last intersting exercise, readers should try to 
apply some simple <a href="exegesis.htm">exegesis</a> semantic to the following newspaper's snippet:<br><br>
<font color=blue>
"<i>Aquafina is the single biggest bottled tap water brand, and its bottles are at the moment 
labeled "<i>P.W.S.</i>" 
Pepsi has been compelled to use new labels, that will now spell out "<i>P.W.S.</i>"  into 
"<i>public water source</i>"
<br><br>
- If this helps clarify the fact that the water originates from public sources, 
then it's a reasonable thing to do - PepsiCo spokeswoman Michelle Naughton said (in July 2007, better late than 
never).

<br><br>
Accountability groups are pressing for similar "<u>concessions</u>" 
from The Coca-Cola Co., which owns the Dasani (Bromate tainted) water brand.
<br><br>
Dasani's Web site says that Dasani comes, all over the world, from "local water supplies" 
and is then filtered.
<br><br>
- We don't believe that consumers are confused about the source 
of Dasani water - Coca-Cola spokeswoman Diana Garza Ciarlante said without blushing. 
- The label clearly states that Dasani is -ahem- '<i>purified water</i>', so nobody should complain".
<br><br>
Sales of bottled tap water has been a growing source of revenue for companies such as PepsiCo Inc., 
based in Purchase, N.Y., and Atlanta-based Coca-Cola</i>"</font><br><br>
Another interesting <a href="exegesis.htm">exegesis</a> exercise can be applied to the following 
tap water advertisement:
"<font color=blue><i>Take the '<u>Dasani 7-day Refresh</u> cycle. Drink Dasani everyday for one week and see how good you can feel. One thing's 
for sure, you'll feel great about yourself. And with Dasani's refreshingly great taste, everyday 
will be a breeze. Renew yourself with the <u>Dasani 7-day Refresh</u> cycle</i></font>".
<br><br>
Try replacing "Dasani" with "Tap water" and you'll automatically obtain a nice reversing exercise.
