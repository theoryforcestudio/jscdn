Non verbal communication (body language) is the means by which animals convey information 
through conscious or subconscious gestures, bodily movements or facial expressions. Human body 
language is as old as our species. The first book on body language appeared more than 350 years 
ago: John Bulwer's <i>Chirologia: or the Natural Language of the Hand</i> (1644), a pioneering 
study of meaningful hand movements.
<p><b>
Kinesics</b><bR>
Kinesics is the study of communication by the bodily movements used when people talk 
to one another.
<p><b>
Proxemics</b><br>
Proxemics is the study of how people use the space around them to convey informations 
nonverbally.
<p><b>Body reversing</b><bR>
Body reversing is the term I'll use meaning how to understand what is the HIDDEN meaning 
of the bodily movements that we can observe in our fellow humans.
<hR width=44%><b><center>
<p>NOTE: As usual certain body language may be exhibited for quite DIFFERENT reasons. 
For example, a certain 
posture or attitude may be struck out of habit, for the sake of comfort or because of nervousness. 
Expert body reversers will learn how to interpretate correctly the various signals.</b></center>
<hR width=44%>
<p>There are many 
places where you can gather an incredible lot of "material": Crowded lifts, excalators, 
busses and underground trains are very useful for Proxemic studies; Parties and work meetings 
are extremely interesting for Kinesics studies; Doctors' waiting rooms, hairdressers' 
waiting "chairs", cinemas and all sort of human queues (busses, shops) 
hyde incredible treasures of information for the attentive eyes of us body reversers.
<p>
<hr>
One of the most interesting gesticulation targets for beginner revrersers, are 
the hand/arm 
gestures used during speeches. Turn your TV on and seek some of those  
hysterical 'television priest' for some easy reversing fun...<br>
Here we go...<br>
<b><p>PRECISION GRIPS<p></b>
Precision grips are used when we hold small things between our thumb and fingertips. 
Empty handed precision grips are displayed during speeches when the speaker wants to 
make a point with 'nicety'. Palm of the hand faces the body.<p>
1.      Thumb touching index finger, hand twenty cm from chin.<bR>
A speaker using this gesture mimics the precise grip of a craftsman manipulating a fine tool. The 
speaker reinforces a statement with "precision" and "delicacy".<br><p>
2.      Thumb touching all fingers.<bR>
Same as above, a signal for something that should be kept in mind.<bR><p>
3.      Thumb almost touching index finger (~three cm between them, remaining fingers are closed)<bR>
Speaker is asking a question or is uncertain about a point at issue<bR><p>
<b><p>POWER GRIPS<p></B>
Power grips are used when wielding objects, such as hammers, whit force. Can have a 
mild (hand bent) or 
forceful (closed fist) form. The grips show a speaker's wish to make a point with strength or to control the 
audience. Had the stupid Germans studied a bit body language in the thirties, they 
would probably never have believed the false promises of the 
nazist hystrionical little leader.<p>
1.      Fingers and thumb make a tightly closed fist.<p>
A forceful power grip. It signals convictiona nd determination. usually deliberately 
exploited by public speakers, priests and politicians who might in reality have neither.
<p>
2.      Fingers and thumb curl inwards as if loosely grasping an object.<p>A mild power grip, usually 
employed by a person saying something without great force of convinction, but who nevertheless 
wishes to be taken seriously.

<font size=+2>Love Signs Used to Signal the Other SEX</font></center>
<BR><P>
<center><font size=+1>Male Courtship Signals</center></font>
<p>Men are clumsy at signalling interest in someone of the opposite sex, ande very slow to pick up 
unspoken responses, when comlpared with women.
<p>
<font size=+1>~ </font>Smoothing the hair down with a hand, making little grooming gestures 
involving  collar and  shirtsleeves, or straightening the tie, and sweeping fanciful specks off a 
shoulder with a hand are typical preening male gestures.<BR>
<font size=+1>~ </font>  Three things that are done with a jacket that buttons 
or zips are crucial signs of courtship.  Men begin by slowly buttoning and unbuttoning, 
or zipping and unzipping, indicating slight nervousness.  They then open the jacket at 
the waste with both hands and hold it open in this position for a few minutes; indicating 
further discomfort and nervousness.  The third and most crucial step is when they take the 
jacket off after having completed steps one and two.  Taking the jacket off means you have 
them hook, line, and sinker.<BR>
<font size=+1>~ </font> Men show interest in women by playing with circular 
objects in the presenct of a woman.  He may squeeze, then let go of, a Coca Cola can 
or a glass, then squeeze and let go again. <BR>
<font size=+1>~ </font> Glancing at a woman's body, and letting her see him do it 
is also a courtship jesture made by males.<BR>
<font size=+1>~ </font> Used all 
over the world is the sock-pulling gesture.  When uncomfortable or nervous, in the 
presence of a woman, men tend to pull up their socks. <BR>
<font size=+1>~ </font> Lightly stroking either the outer or, less often, the 
inner thigh is an indication of sexual interest.<BR>
<font size=+1>~ </font> When seated in a chair or leaning against a wall, 
he may sometimes spread his legs to give a crotch display.<BR>
<font size=+1>~ </font> To accentuate physical size and show readiness to be 
involved with a female, men will often stand with their hands on their hips.<BR>
<font size=+1>~ </font> The most aggresive sexual display a man can make is 
the agressive thumbs-in-belt, "cowpoke" stance.  This is accomplished when one or both 
thumbs are hooked into the belt of the pants with the downwardpointing fingers framing 
the groin area. This posture draws attention to the male's crotch.<BR>
<font size=+1>~ </font> Men in a courtship situation usually tend to have 
high muscle tone, that is, body sagging seems to disappear, stomachs are tucked in 
a little tighter and chests tend to protrude a little more.  It seems that the body 
assumes a more erect posture than usual.<BR>
<font size=+1>~ </font> Sly winks, accidental touches beneath a business table, 
gentle rugging of the back and moving in closer are also considered courtship gestures.<BR>
<font size=+1>~ </font> Excited interest can be seen in a flushed appearance 
in the cheeks and unconscious pupil dilatation.<BR>
<BR>
<center><font size=+1>Female Courtship Signals</font></center>
<p>NOTE: As I wrote above, certain body language may be exhibited for reasons other than sexual attraction. For example, a certain 
posture or attitude may be struck out of habit, for the sake of comfort or because of nervousness. real 
body reversers will learn how to interpretate correctly the various signals. In other words: don't 
start getting too hot if a girl gives you the "shoulder look", may be you'r just a pain 
in her neck :-)
<p>
<font size=+1>~ </font> Women toss their hair, whether short or long, briskly 
from side to side, over a shoulder, or away from the face to indicate preening. Hair is removed from face to 
leave it exposed for male admiration.<BR>
<font size=+1>~ </font> Sometimes with partially closed eyelids, the woman 
holds the man's gaze just long enough for him to notice, then she quickly looks away.  
This has the tauntilizing feeling of peeping or being peeped at, and can light the fires 
of most normal men. <BR>
<font size=+1>~ </font> Women also use the sideways glance to show interest.  This 
glance involves looking at the man through partially closed eyelids, but dropping the gaze 
a moment after it has been noticed. <BR>
<font size=+1>~ </font> Licking the lips, slightly pouting the mouth, or applying 
cosmetics to moisten or redden the lips all are indicators of a courtship invitation. Unconsciously 
imitating the appearance of sexually stimulated and receptive female genitals.<BR>
<font size=+1>~ </font> Slight exposure of the shoulder from a partially fallen 
blouse is again an example of "flirting."  Rae Dawn Cong said it best: "You can seduce 
a man without taking anything off...without even touching him."  This revealed shoulder 
is one example. Also the "shoulder look": Looking at the man behind over a raised 
shoulder is typical self-mimicry: 
the shoulder resembles the brest and so is sexually inviting.<BR>
<font size=+1>~ </font> When women massage their necks or head with one hand, 
it has the effect of raising the breast on one side of the body intensifying cleavage.  
It also exposes the armpit, which, even when shaved, has an erotic significance.<BR>
<font size=+1>~ </font> A female interested in making a subtle courtship 
gesture might gradually expose the smooth, soft skin of her wrists.  The wrist area has 
long been considered one of the highly erotic areas of the body.  In this position, 
the palms of a woman are also made visible to the male. This is an inconscious 
invitation to caress.<BR>
<font size=+1>~ </font>  Playing with any cylindrical object such as a pencil, 
pen, stem if wineglass or finger is a reflection of subconscious desires.<BR>
<font size=+1>~ </font>  Sometimes women will even accentuate the roll in their 
hips when walking in front of a male they want to attract.<BR>
<font size=+1>~ </font> When a woman sits with one leg tucked under the other 
and points the folded leg toward the person whom she wants to attract, the message 
communicated is, "I feel very comfortable with you.  I'd like to get to know you better."<BR>
<font size=+1>~ </font>  Women tend to stand with their legs apart with weight 
on one foot, when displaying a sign of openness or availability. This draws attention to genital area. 
(Of course this may also be a feeling of superiority, agressivity or impatience as well, duh)<BR>
<font size=+1>~ </font> Slowly crossing or uncrossing the legs while being 
watched by an interested male is a strong attraction signal, especailly when the female 
is slightly stroking her thigh.<BR>
<font size=+1>~ </font> Women entwine their legs to draw attention.  Most men 
agree that the leg twine, (one leg is pressed firmly against the other to give the 
appearance of high muscle tone which the body displays when it is ready for 
sexual intercourse) is the most appealing sitting position a woman 
can take. (Of course also: nervousness, shyness, defensiveness, duh)<BR>
<font size=+1>~ </font> Once the legs are crossed, sometimes a woman begins 
to slightly kick her top leg back and forth. this kicking or thrusting, again, displays 
a courtship signal. <BR>
<font size=+1>~ </font> Dangling one shoe while seated in a relaxed position, 
with one leg crossed over the other knee, is one of the most intense courtship signals 
woman use to indicate interest in a male. Phallic mimicry, as the foot makes tiny thrusting movements with the 
dangling shoe.<BR>
<font size=+1>~ </font> Even when a woman keeps time to music with her head and 
hands, leans forward towards a male, or even brushes the male's body with her hand or 
breast, she is still conveying effective courtship gestures. <BR>

<hr><b>
STEEPLING</b><bR>
<p>The palms of the hands face each other and the fingertips touch, forming a shape rather like a 
church steeple. This is a characteristic gesture that people make, usually while 
seated, when fdeeling especially confident duringa  converstaion. There are several variants:
<p>
1.      The high steeple<br>
Both elbows rest on a table or desk and teh forearms are raised,so taht the steepling fingers point 
upwards (Academics, Doctors, Lawyers while delivering an 'expert' opinion).<p>
2.      The low steeple<br>
Both elbows rest on the arms of a chair or the tops of the steepler's thights, with the forearm pointing 
forwards and the fingertips steepling between the thights or knees. Most women steeple 
this way: in their laps if seated, at wais level if standing.
<p>
3.      The concentrated (poker player's) steeple<br>
The hands steeple while hidden under a table, for instance. This tends to occurr when an individual 
wants to hide his or her confident feelings. Poker players may betray that they have a 
good hand like this.<p>
4.      The semi-steeple<br>
When sitting, the steepler places the arms in the low steepling position and the hands in the lap. 
The fingers of one hand clasp the back of the other, which is CLOSED, and forming a fist, its knuckles opressed into the upper hand's palm. 
This is a far ùmore subtle indication of confidence than the full steepling gestures.<hr>
<b>Defensive hand and arm gestures</b><p>
Crossing the arms in front of the body is an almost istinctive attempt to protect the heart and lungs against threat 
(Remember "the countrary position" as well: the 'hands behind the back' walkabout by teachers or police on foot 
patrol, holding the head high and both hands clasped behind the back has a precise meaning: 
this leaves the body vulnerable front area unprotected and signals a combination of superiority and 
self-assurance).<p>
1.      Basic crossed arms<bR>
Both arms are folded across the chest with one forearm crossing the other, so 
that one hand rests on an upper arm and the other arm is tucked between elbow and chest.
 We tend to do this whenever we feel slightly anxious, for instance standing in a crowded lift or in a queue.
