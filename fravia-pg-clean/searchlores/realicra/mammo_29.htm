<center><i>Good old +Mammon_! He should work MUCH more on this kind of fascinating stuff! Here, 
for instance, the one 
example he gives is (IMHO) 
 not enough, and his assertion: </i>"<font color=purple>In the name of brevity, laziness, and
the fact that mainstream news periodicals are generally distasteful, only one
demonstration has been provided for each technique</font>"<I> carries only one (the second) element of 
'real' truth. Well, oh my, let's enjoy what we have here, let's hope to get more... Omnia homini dum vivit 
speranda sunt.<br>Many years ago I remember having read a science fiction novel where an 
astroship (from 
earth, duh) landed on an alien planet where cars were noisy and slow and cumbersome but LOOKED nice and fast and 
rational, and the lusers driving them didn't notice it at all (quite the contrary: last 'trends' were soo greaat :-) so to 
say the "last 
stadium" of the "USA 
today syndrome" +Mammon_ speaks about... Hey! Am I mistaken or today's cars are always 
<u>too hot</u> because of the wind-tunnel aerodynamic of their glass panels? Old cars, 
in the fifties, were much cooler, if less "aerodynamically correct" because their 
glass panels were NOT idiotically oblique... just try one of those old-fashioned black (beautifully functional)  
"Morris taxis" next time you will visit London during sommer... and compare with the last 
BMW_AlfaRomeo_Peugeot_YouNameTheClone crampy and boiling hot model :-)<bR>Besides: 
how oft can you 
roam and run your "aerodynamical" car as if you were inside a wind tunnel? You mostly don't run inside wind 
tunnels at all, you stupid sod: despite advertising you are NOT running on a lonesome winding country route 
without nobody else in sight but trees and flowers (see the Goebbelsian "car ads" on your 
own favourite magazines... how oft do they actually show 
you that nice car "you should 
buy" routinely 
crushed to snailvelocity inside millions of "fellow 
commuters" on your usual congested 
motorroad?) So you'r not running much around at 180 Kmperhour...<bR>And, come to think of it in July, 
how oft -instead- would you wish you were sitting in a cooler car?...<bR> 
I have forgotten the title of that old SF-novel... those alien cars did not work well and 
those stupid aliens did not notice 
it, funny story indeed... anyone remembers its Author?<bR>I spoke too much, sorry: that's because I'm stimulated and 
moved by this essay... and I agree with +Mammon_'s severe 'Urteil': </i>"<font color=purple>Homo Consumerus is a slow-sitted, lazy beast
that requires constant distraction from its surroundings before it will consent to
being milked; its bovine nature, however, makes it quite easy to placate.</font>". <i>Enjoy 
another nice reversing mirror!</i>

                 aside</i><p>by +Mammon_<p>01 July 1998</center>
                 <BR>
                 <P>
                 In the early 1980's, at the start of the Age of Greed Apparent, amidst 
                 media glut, fading
                 nationalism, and the growing awareness that private -- as opposed to 
                 political or national --
                 interests were determining government policy, the <i>cyberpunk</i> 
                 movement was born.  By
                 origin an SF literary sub-genre that spread "underground" through film, 
                 music, art, and
                 gaming channels, cyberpunk presented a cynical view of the future of 
                 technology,
                 characterized by zaibatsu, high-tech lowlifes, and media culture. 
                 Fifteen years later a
                 passing glance at the world shows the zaibatsu struggling for power
                 with 
                 provincial and 
                 global regulatory agencies, an expanding arsenal of cheap and portable 
                 "street level" 
                 technology, and a patently mass-media oriented global culture.<P>
                 The bulk of information traffic through mainstream media channels is 
                 prepared for public
                 consumption according to formulas derived from Goebbels, Ellul,
                 McLuhan, 
                 and other pioneers
                 in the fields of propaganda and mass communication. In the mass media 
                 industry, the end
                 "product" is becoming farther and farther removed from the source 
                 material that inspired
                 it; while in the case of entertainment "product" this simply results in 
                 the production of
                 programs that are banal and virtually indistinguishable from each other 
                 on a narrative level,
                 in the case of news "product" this can result in an abridgement, 
                 excision, or even a
                 misinterpretation of factual information. It is for this reason 
                 imperative that any party
                 interested in the pursuit of knowledge--that being factual, empirical 
                 knowledge, as
                 opposed to a simple, placative "answer"--become versed in the analytic 
                 tools necessary to
                 cull real information from the vast sources of <i>disinformation</i> 
                 being peddled as "facts".

                 <B>Print Periodicals</b><P>
                 Events which need not be related here led to the impromptu
                 demonstration 
                 of three very
                 rudimentary techniques used in the print media to affect the attention 
                 and perception of the
                 reader. These techniques should serve as an introduction to the "mind 
                 behind the magazine",
                 and should demonstrate also the proper frame of mind in which a 
                 periodical is to be read
                 critically. In the name of brevity, laziness, and the fact that 
                 mainstream news periodicals
                 are generally distasteful, only one demonstration has been provided for 
                 each technique;
                 readers are encouraged to contribute further examples from their own 
                 experience. <P>

                 <B>Hide-and-seek Articles</b> There is a disturbing tendency for 
                 periodicals to "hide"
                 their articles amongst a number of full page ads, making the odds of 
                 randomly opening the
                 periodical to a page with an ad equal to or greater than (>=) the
                 chance 
                 or opening to
                 an article. There are two basic tricks to this: moving the table of 
                 contents a random number 
                 of pages into the magazine (often 2-6), and not displaying page numbers 
                 on non-article pages. The first
                 forces the reader to view ads simply to find out what is in the 
                 periodical; the second forces the reader
                 to view ads when searching for an article--the search for an article in 
                 effect becomes a
                 search for page numbers, often ending up in the reader finding a page 
                 number, then counting
                 the number of pages until the next page number, simply in order to get 
                 their bearings within
                 the magazine. Note that even more subtle variations of this technique 
                 may be used within
                 articles through the use of half- and quarter-page ads which interrupt 
                 the reader's
                 standard left-right/top-down order of reading.
                 <P>
                 <u>Case Study 1: <i>Business Week</i> June 29, 1998</u> To start off 
                 with, the table of
                 contents for this periodical is found after two dual-page ads (the
                 first 
                 for Novell, the 
                 second for Hoechst) and is numbered as page four, indicating that 
                 publishers like 
                 programmers start counting at 0. The target article, "Is your car 
                 smarter than you?" in 
                 the <i>Science & Technology</i> section, is listed as starting on page 
                 85. Experiment: 
                 open the mag in about the middle, you see a psuedo-article ("Special 
                 Advertising Section" for the
                 U.S. Open) called "The World Golf Village" and a facing ad for Royal & 
                 Sunalliance. Objective: 
                 search for a page number. Flip back 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 pages... a column 
                 called "The Corporation", 
                 no page number. Go back to the starting point, turn forward 1, 2, 3, 4, 
                 5 pages...finally 
                 a page number, coincidentally also the first page of the article, 85. 
                 Deeper investigation 
                 reveals that between pages 63 and 85 there are no page numbers.<P>
                 <B>The <i>USA Today</i> Syndrome</b> This should come as no surprise in 
                 the modern "visual"
                 age: people prefer to have information presented to them graphically. 
                 The "<i>USA Today</i> 
                 Syndrome" is a term that refers to the presentation of news or 
                 information in a format that 
                 is not only graphic but simplistic--for example pie charts with no hard 
                 information, maps
                 of "trouble spots" with no geographic information, technical drawings 
                 with no technology in
                 them. A bit of experience with journals (the serious quarterly ones
                 that 
                 one rarely finds 
                 outside of libraries, as opposed to a weekly or monthly "journal" from 
                 the news vendor) will
                 demonstrate that one can use charts and graphs to efficiently present 
                 large amounts of data
                 (note that those large amounts of data must be present), that maps can 
                 contain topographical
                 information which may contribute to one's understanding of why so many 
                 "trouble spots" 
                 (fires, famines, murders, etc) are occuring in such a specific area and 
                 not in others, and
                 that depictions of actual electronic or mechanical components can 
                 demonstrate a leap in
                 technology as adequately as a dicussion of those components. Failure to 
                 include full data
                 in a graphic such as those mentioned is one of the prime symptoms of
                 the 
                 "<i>USA Today</i> 
                 Syndrome", and in the case of these three graphic methods indicates
                 that 
                 1) there is not a
                 large enough amount of data known to justify a chart/graph, 2) there is 
                 not enough information
                 known about the topography of the mapped area or the incidents 
                 themselves cannot be placed in
                 a specific, definite area on the map, and 3) the actual electronic or 
                 mechanical components
                 either are not known or do not exist.

                 <u>Case Study 1: <i>Business Week</i> June 29, 1998</u> The "Is your
                 car 
                 smarter than you?" 
                 article has two "USA Today-esque" features: a cutaway car view on page 
                 85 and a "Cars get
                 Siliconized" graph on page 86. The graph is useless and trivial, a 
                 y-axis of dollars (cost
                 of semiconductors per vehicle) from 0 to 300 and an x-axis of years
                 from 
                 '92 to '01; the
                 cost starts at $50 in 1992 and ends at $275 in 2001--useless knowledge, 
                 the price of chips
                 in auto manufacture, but potentially indicative of the article's claim, 
                 that the trend
                 towards computerization of cars is increasing (interestingly enough the 
                 graph is a steady 
                 slope, indicating no "increasing trend" but rather a "consistent 
                 trend"). The cutaway
                 graphic, however, deserves more treatment. The car is teal (very easy
                 on 
                 the eye) with
                 15 numbered details that are referred to (though not altogether 
                 explained) in the caption. 
                 The caption labels the detail-items with  high-tech descriptions that 
                 are somewhat clarified
                 in the article, however the illustrations of these technological 
                 advances is simplistic to 
                 the  point of being insulting: "By-wire steering" is the label affixed 
                 to a picture of a 
                 circle (steering wheel) and cylinder (steering column); the  "60 
                 microprocessors" are a cube 
                 the size of a Car Wars power plant behind the  back seat, the 
                 "yaw-and-pitch sensor" is a
                 cube on the dashboard, and the worst of the lot is an advanced 
                 acceleration system labelled 
                 "acceleration" and depicted in the graphic by a thin rectangle (gas 
                 pedal).This is <i>not</i>
                 a technical drawing, it bears no relation to the text other than by 
                 scattering a random
                 sampling of keywords across an amorphous depiction of a car, and it
                 does 
                 nothing to
                 illustrate or illuminate points made in the article.<P>
                 <B>Science Fiction - Science Fact</b> As devotees of the venerated 
                 <i>Analog</i> magazine
                 will attest, there is a great difference between "science fiction" and 
                 "science fact".
                 The term "science fiction" is used to refer to a literary device in 
                 which the author
                 extrapolates--hopefully with a sound scientific or technological 
                 background--the existence or
                 application of various technologies; usually this is to provide greater 
                 narrative berth, or
                 to sound out implications of a new or theorized technology. The term 
                 "science fact" is used to
                 refer to "cutting-edge" technologies that exist in theory or in 
                 practice. It is quite commonplace
                 for technical articles in mainstream magazines to devoid themselves of 
                 any "science fact", thus
                 making them read as "science fiction"--that is, the visions or 
                 propaganda of various technological
                 industries. Technical articles that lack a certain degree of verifiable 
                 scientific or technical
                 information are bound to confuse the scientifically aware reader, by 
                 presenting a premise for
                 the existence or potential existence of a technology without any actual 
                 proof of its existence.

                 <u>Case Study 1: <i>Business Week</i> June 29, 1998</u> The "Is your
                 car 
                 smarter than you?" 
                 article once again. A brief sample of the technical illumination 
                 supplied by the article:
                 "In 'by-wire' systems, when a driver turns the steering wheel or stomps 
                 on 
                 the brake, the movement doesn't directly turn the wheels or apply the 
                 brakes as it used to. 
                 Instead, the motion is detected by sensors and relayed to computer 
                 chips. These chips then 
                 signal motors to turn the wheels or activate the brakes. Once 
                 microprocessors entered such 
                 control loops, they brought the ability to do more than just relay the 
                 driver's intent. They 
                 could embellish it with intelligence." Again: "With a different set of 
                 sensors and motors, 
                 the way a car rides can adapt to road-surface changes on a 
                 second-by-second basis. Other 
                 sensors will surround cars with an early-warning cocoon. Infrared 
                 detectors can spot the heat
                 of a car in the blind spot and sound an alarm when you flick the turn 
                 signal before changing 
                 lanes." The key here is such technical jargon as "chips", "motors", 
                 "sensors", and 
                 "microprocessors"; even the Barsoom stories had more scientific 
                 explanations of equipment. 
                 What is not covered is any actual discussion of the technology
                 involved. 
                 How are these 
                 sensors going to keep from being damaged by dust, rattle, age, etc? 
                 While the increased 
                 emissions (non-chemical) from vehicles interfere with their own 
                 instruments? How long will

                 <B>Concluding Notes</b><P>
                 There are plenty of similar techniques in use by print and graphic 
                 media. The sad part about
                 the whole affair is that there is no national/global conspiracy to 
                 deprive the masses of
                 information; rather, this is the result of decades of stimulus-reponse 
                 testing conducted
                 by media companies and researchers when they monitor audience response 
                 through sales,
                 surveys, and public or private feedback (usually in that order). The 
                 "media industry", if
                 you will, has a "target" for everything it produces; the more general 
                 the target, the
                 greater the sales potential. To appeal to the most general target (the 
                 "masses") you must
                 shoot for the lowest common denominator--the slowest one in the herd, 
                 the sickest and oldest
                 and most banal antelope. Mass-market periodicals (and even paperbacks 
                 and television shows) are
                 targetted at anyone with a grade 7 education (age 12), while newspapers 
                 target anyone with a
                 grade 3 education (age 8). <P>
                 The consumer as targetted by the media industry is a mindless beast. 
                 Extensive media analysis
                 has shown that violence, porn, and celebrities--all means of vicarious 
                 living for the masses--
                 sell like nothing else. Compounding the effect are the short attention 
                 span acquired through
                 years of media overstimulation, and the quickly fading memory resulting 
                 from information overload
                 or saturation and from the general distraction/escapism offered by 
                 various media channels in
                 public and private life. In the end the audience for any mainstream 
                 publication is appeased by
                 quick, unrelated stories that require no further investigation, no 
                 background knowledge for full
                 comprehension ("<i>never</i> confuse them with facts"), no 
                 self-interrogation to determine one's
                 opinion on a matter. <i>Homo Consumerus</i> is a slow-sitted, lazy
                 beast 
                 that requires constant
                 distraction from its surroundings before it will consent to being 
                 milked; its bovine nature, however,
                 makes it quite easy to placate.

                 <b>Appendix: Towards a Reversing Toolkit</b><P>
                 The term "reversing" is used rather than cracking for the simple reason 
                 that cracking is
                 simply a crude application of reversing; often, as the Hiew manual 
                 states, a matter of
                 "changing 07xh to EBxh". Obviously a reversing toolkit for reality
                 would 
                 require coverage
                 of media analysis, fundamental logical and critical skills, an 
                 introduction to varied
                 frames of reference ("mode x") and the means to switch between them,
                 and 
                 an inspiration
                 to search for knowledge. At this stage only a few pointers can be given 
                 in follow-through
                 for the preceding work.<P>
                 Advertisers, producers, and artists will all try to circumvent your 
                 conscious will by
                 taking advantage of the following "loopholes" in the individual:
                 <LI><i>Need Sniffers</i> Based on the hierarchy of needs as defined by 
                 Abraham Maslow, these
                 methods will attempt to find or create an unfilled need and then offer
                 a 
                 product to fill it.
                 Examples include dandruff shampoo, anti-static-cling sheets ("fabric 
                 softeners"), and the film
                 "How to Get Ahead In Advertising".
                 <LI><i>Nature Bugs</i> There are a few base methods that attempt to
                 take 
                 advantage or biological
                 bugs inherent in the human design; often pattern-matching, color, and 
                 mood manipulations are used,
                 although more specific methods are often directed at sexuality, 
                 dominance/power ("alpha male")
                 status, and territorial acquisition/defense.
                 <LI><i>Attention Spoof</i> This is a subset of the Nature Bugs: 
                 essentially it takes advantage
                 of a survival trait--the ability to notice and respond to changes in
                 the 
                 environment, which is a
                 form of pattern "non-matching"--to attract the sensory perception (and 
                 therefore, the theory goes, 
                 the conscious or subconscious attention) of the individual. This
                 usually 
                 takes the form of 
                 flashing or flickering images, constant changes in light frequency or 
                 sound tone and volume, or
                 bright/clashing colours. Examples include the HTML "BLINK" tag, banner 
                 ads, and sleep deprivation 
                 techniques used on POWs.
                 <LI><i>Habit Exploits</i> If the target audience has a common
                 background 
                 --usually in education,
                 military, entertainment, or religion-- then habits or traditions common 
                 to that background
                 can be exploited to force the audience to react or perceive without its 
                 conscious knowledge. Examples based on
                 Western Eurporean/American reading would be the habitual interspersing 
                 of images/irrelevant text
                 in the left-right/up-down read order of relevant text, or the 
                 contra-habitual placing of white
                 text on black background to distinguish the text from all others.
