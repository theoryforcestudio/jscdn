<i>In an old comics of "Mandrake the Magician" (the very old ones are incredibly 
interesting for advanced reversing purposes) there was a war, in some other 
dimension, between a civilisation based on plants and a civilisation based on 
machines. Incredibly 'ecologically correct' for those times: Mandrake himself (with Lothar, of course) was sort of 'caught' between the 
two completely different society models at war. The 'plant' society had a lot of 
quite 'modern' ecological stuff (like genetic transformed trees that grew houses and 
flying seeds for transport purposes) and the 'machine' society was pretty scary, in fact 
it had only <u>one</u> habitant, 
a sort of 'rebel' that always did run some personal activity, 
all alone, since everybody else was 
'enjoying life' without doing anything at all, served and entertained by machines. 
All the other habitants died because they 
 simply went 'too dick', since they almost never moved and lived more and more in a 'virtual 
reality'... remember me of somebody like us... yeah, 
this is a good introduction for Cioff's work below... at least I like it.<br><br>...ah 
yes, finally, thanks Mandrake, the 
'lonely machine survivor' happily married the queen of plants... a typical 
American happy end that will <u>not</u> 
bless our future... since we definitely miss the ecological counterpart to the machine and obesity world...</i>

Dear Fravia+ I'll make another go for the beef. A little more cooked
this time, I hope - not only a shopping list from +ORC's supermarket. My
intention is to explain without pressing ready-made cracks on the
readience
(not an audience in this medium, I'm afraid). But my ability may not be
fully up to my ambitions. You may need to edit it, or you could wait
until
your restructuring of your site has reached this essay. The editorial
privileges,
as always, are yours. But I hope you are using a good old DOS program to
edit it. For example the editor in PCTOOLS (before Symantec). I came
across
version 7 the other day. It even does hexediting. My old 486 has got a
new life - forget about old LoseDOwS 3.1. The real WIN -DOS 5.0 outruns
it. And I had almost forgotten in my relief from being released from
WordPerfect..

<P>Regards Cioff

Cracking some official thinking from a major drug company</H2>
The drug industry - you haven't really noticed it, have you? They're the
good guys, helping off with all those wonderful drugs against those
horrible
lethal diseases. And helping the less sick to a better life.

<P>Drugs are expensive because there's got to be so much research to
find
them. Endless laboratories with incredible bright Nobel laureates doing
all this glorious brainwork. Millions and millions of rats. Millions and
millions of people for tests. So when these drugs reach the market, they
are all safe and effective.
<BR>
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<H3>
Digression (?)</H3>
OK. I've had a kidney transplant. I need drugs to make me keep my
kidney.
So they've put me on ciclosporin (sorry, Sandimmun Neoral from Novartis
- the only one) and some other drugs. The major one is the ciclosporin,
though (nice name for a biker's drug, btw). Without it I would soon be
without my kidney and back into dialysis twice a week. The process would
not be a very nice one, either.

<P>It doesn't cost me much, really. About the equivalent of a bicycle
wheel
per year (150 Euro). Did you say drugs were expensive? Not to me,
anyway.

<P>But theres a snag. My daily dose of 300 milligrams costs about 15
Euro.
5500 per year. I would probably be able to afford it, but I'd rather
not.

<P>So it is paid my my national Social Security system. Those nice
people
who use other people's tax money to pay my expenses. Most people think
it's OK, by the way, to pay this part of my expenses . Nobody would like
to have my kidney and my drugs. They'd rather have their own.

<P>Sandimmun is a rather low-profile drug towards the public (not like
Valium or Prozac or Viagra). It is used by a few patients, relatively
speaking,
and prescribed by specialists for rare diseases or sub specialists in
the
transplantation hospitals, and nobody wishes to prescribe or use it
except
when in dire need. Price doesn't really matter to the decision. The drug
is expensive, but the patients are few, and hi-tech medicine always
carries
status. High transplantation rates are nice to boast about for the
politicians
and physicians.

<P>But waitaminute. The price of Sandimmun kills, though not in my
country.
In a poor country this price does kill. If I were a transplant patient
of a poor country, My Sandimmun costs could pay a lot of polio vaccine
or measles vaccine or intestinal worm killers or antimalarials or
antituberculosis
drugs&nbsp; (if you went to the world market to buy them&nbsp; - from
India,
for example). The expenses for one single person will deprive whole
villages
of medicines altogether. Either the transplanted person will die, or all
those others. The hell of a choice of you have a conscience.

<P>Anyway, the ruling class of the poor countries don't care about the
poor. They rather pay for the excecutive jets, or the St. Peter
Cathedral
replicas, or the guns and tanks and fighter planes, or the fortified
Mercedes
Benzes).

<P>Novartis gets away with this price without a public outrage because
transplantations are mainly carried out in the rich countries that can
afford it. And transplantations in the poor countries are mainly done on
the rich, who have already stolen the money they need.

<P>OK, I'm digressing.
<BR>
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR>Back to those nice people in the industry. Everybody believes in
these
guys. So of course - the stock market likes them as well. They're the
winners
- and they deserve it.

<P>Wellcome were the ones with the first anti-AIDS drug: Retrovir -
zidovudine,
also known as AZT. You know AZT, don't you? The wonder drug (for a
while)
which was approved prematurely because the manufacturer had made the
American
homosexuals believe that this drug was THE cure and had to get
immediately
on the market to save the lives. It was a disappointment, as you all
know.

<P>Later on Wellcome were bought (Was it 12 000 000 000 Euros, or was it
more - I don't remember exactly) by the UK firm Glaxo and fused into
Glaxo
Wellcome.

<P>Later new drugs arrived, and today, with triple therapy with the
protease
inhibitors and the reverse transcriptase inhibitors - well, the HIV
infected
people don't die of AIDS any more when they are given this drug
combination.
At a price, of course. The drugs are highly profitable.

<P>Anyway: Glaxo Wellcome obviously are among the heroes in the struggle
against AIDS. Let's see what's on their minds. And for simplicity: let's
go to the Web.

<P>Fravia+ has taught me a lot about searching. But this time I resort
to simple guessing and just type www.glaxowellcome.com in the location
window of Netscape - and it's a hit.

<P>The site says nothing, but transfers me nicely into the United
Kingdom
site.

<P><A HREF="http://www.glaxowellcome.co.uk">http://www.glaxowellcome.co.uk</A>

<P>And what do we find on the homepage?!: A menu. Some quite trivial
scientific
stuff, and some spam. But one item on it is a literature odyssey. mmm -
Interesting. The scientific thinking of the company. Its philosophy. Its
ethics. So we take a look.

<P>Some subjects we leave alone for a while - like AIDS and hepatitis C.
And asthma. If you have read my previous essays on Fravia+' site, you
might
know some of my points of view. Anyway, those pages seem harder to
crack.
Maybe later. So we delve into today's winner, the easy crack:

<P><A href="http://www.glaxowellcome.co.uk/health/odyssey/obesity/">http://www.glaxowellcome.co.uk/health/odyssey/obesity/</a>

<P>They page is still there on 4th December 1998 - God knows for how
long.
Anyway, I've got a mirror on my hard disk 8--]

<P>On we go to the next page.

<P><A href="http://www.glaxowellcome.co.uk/health/odyssey/obesity/obes1.html">http://www.glaxowellcome.co.uk/health/odyssey/obesity/obes1.html</A>

<P>It's a nice summary of the body weight situation in some countries.

<I><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT
SIZE=+3>Introduction</FONT></FONT></I></H2>
<FONT SIZE=+1><I><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">In the past two decades,
obesity has emerged as an increasingly important healthcare problem
around
the world, with both developed and developing countries experiencing a
dramatic increase in its prevalence. It is estimated that about 100
million
people now have a body mass index greater than
30.</FONT></I>&nbsp;</FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT SIZE=-2>Body mass index: Take my mass, 75 kg, and my height,
165
cm. This gives a body mass index of 75/(1.65x1.65)=28 (Cioff's
comment).</FONT>&nbsp;
<BR><I><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>The trend reflects
economic
changes taking place in the developing world, as well as a global
tendency
towards urbanization and the use of labour-saving machinery.
Furthermore,
as distribution systems improve and people's disposable income
increases,
more tasty, variable, and rich food becomes available to more people. As
a result, more people are overeating at a time when their energy
expenditure
is dropping. The energy balance equation is shifted positively and
populations
relentlessly gain weight.</FONT></FONT></I>&nbsp;

<P><I><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>The United States
exemplifies
the rapid change that has occurred in the prevalence of gross
overweight.
According to the latest National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(nhanes), which was carried out on a representative sample of the
population
from 1988 to 1991, 33% of the American public is obese. This represents
an increase of eight percentage points since the previous N.Hanes survey
one decade ago, when 25% of the population was found to be obese. Some
groups of people are particularly at risk, such as African American
women.
The prevalence of obesity in this group has risen to 48.5%, and to as
high
as 60% in African American women aged between 40 and 60. In Britain, the
number of clinically obese people has doubled in the past 10 years to
17%
of men and 13% of women. More than 50% of the population are
overweight.</FONT></FONT></I>&nbsp;
<BR>
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<CENTER><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Horrible, isn't it?
I suppose it's facts. Nothing to crack.Then there are lengthy chapters
about causes and sophisticated studies on metabolism. I don't want to go
into the details; they are code cracking exercises. In this essay I go
for the Zen crack.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT></CENTER>

<CENTER><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>So we make an
unconditional
jump to the treatment part</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;</CENTER>

<H3>
<I><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+2>Pharmacological
approaches</FONT></FONT></I></H3>
<I><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>As the chronic nature of
obesity has become clear, clinicians have realized that a long-term
commitment
to obesity treatment is necessary.</FONT>&nbsp;</FONT></I>&nbsp;

<P><I><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;The first
investigator
to take this concept seriously was the American researcher Michael
Weintraub,
who in 1992 published the results of treating obese patients with 34
weeks
of combination drug therapy. The two drugs administered (phentermine and
fenfluramine) have different mechanisms of action: adrenergic and
serotoninergic.
Weintraub obtained excellent results by supporting the drug therapy with
a behaviour modification programme, which included detailed advice on
nutrition
and an exercise prescription. The resultant weight loss appeared to be
sustained as long as the drugs were taken.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT></I>&nbsp;
<BR><B><FONT SIZE=-1>(This is the notorious "phen-phen" that you can
find
lots of stuff about if you look up fda.gov - Cioff's comment)</FONT></B>
<BR><I><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Weintraub's work led
to a conceptual shift in obesity management, away from an exclusive
focus
on traditional behaviour modification techniques. The idea has gained
ground
that obesity is an incurable condition like hypertension or diabetes,
for
which the appropriate treatment includes dietary intervention as well as
drug therapy - and in which drug therapy, if instituted, is long-term.
The problem is that the drug armamentarium for treating hypertension and
diabetes is much richer than that for treating obesity. One new drug
designed
for long-term use, dexfenfluramine, has recently come onto the market in
the United States, and has been used in Europe for more than eight
years.
Two other drugs - sibutramine and orlistat - are undergoing clinical
trials
and their manufacturers hope to have them on the market by 1997. All
three
drugs clearly have a greater effect on weight loss than a placebo, but
none is a magic bullet. They are modestly effective in improving the
possibility
of weight loss, and further testing is necessary to determine their
effect
on weight maintenance and on the potential adverse health effects of
obesity.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT></I>&nbsp;

<P><I><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Pharmaceutical
companies
have large teams at work in an effort to develop new medicines, and it
is likely that more powerful drugs will be marketed in the future as
more
knowledge is gained about food intake regulation and thermogenesis. It
remains to be seen how successful this new era of pharmacology will be,
but it seems clear that the present drugs will only work if they are
part
of a treatment package that includes nutritional and exercise
components.</FONT></FONT></I></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
&nbsp;

<P>This looks nice and scientific, doesn't it? The authors talk
disinterestedly
about obesity, disinterestedly about genetics (I've skipped it here; see
for yourself if you like), disinterestedly about lifestyle, and rather
critically about the drugs (two of which were recently withdrawn
recently
because they caused fibrosis of the heart).
<H2>
The crack</H2>
Friends: We are being trapped. At first sight the reader could be
impressed
by the thorough scientificality of these people. You could be easily
spoofed
into believing that GlaxoWellcome, this mighty company with all these
nice
products in their portefolio and their friendly homepage have an honest
approach. Read no further - Just look at the details of the page, and
you
will be a believer in their virtues. Obesity is a health problem. Yes.
The mechanisms are difficult to grasp. Yes. Still much basic research
needs
to be done.&nbsp; Yes. Endless loops of machine code. Only for experts,
really. Nice of them to make a popular version so the common people can
understand. But certainly, with all these efforts, there will sooner or
later be a final solution.

<P>This is the way to put the newbies on the hook. The old cracker and
reverser will take one step back, download the pages, take a pipe and
pack
of matches, and smoke over the text for a while. No hurry. Leaf back and
forth a few times. Make a printout and some squiggles in the margin and
some underlinings of key words. Maybe take a small drink. Glass of wine
or something. Play some music. Slowly the hidden pattern will appear.

<P>It's Zen cracking.

<P>The clue can be found in the concluding paragraphs.

<P>Their concluding message is guarded. They promise little, but show
you
the goals of the game: Just you wait. Let's go on searching for the
cause
of fatness. Sooner or later we'll find the drug that manipulates your
appetite
or your digestion or your metabolism in such a way that you won't need
to get fat if you buy our products. <B>The products of today will
probably
not work alone; you will have to modify your diet and do exercise as
well.</B>
<H2>
Reversing?</H2>
Reality crackers in +ORC's footsteps and Fravia+' site know why people
get fat. It is because we have huge industries that make their money
from
selling junk foods. It is because we have relentless and never sleeping
advertising of those same junk foods. It is because we have huge
industries
selling cars to people, and making cars status, and politicians doing
far
too little for public transportation. It is because we have politicians
who permit workplaces to be placed far away from the places where people
live, so they gotta use motorised transportation, not the bike. It is
beause
we have families so pressed for time that parents have no energy or time
for proper cooking with low-fat low salt fresh ingredients like all that
nice fish (OK, frozen, but anyway) or vegetables or meat. It is because
lots of people have too few meaningful goals to set their lives to, so
they spend their precious evening not in surfing to Fravia+' site, or
reading
good books or interesting newspapers, or knitting, or going to cencerts
or theatres, or helping people who need it, or cooking real food. They
watch commercial TV and drink substandard beers and eat junk.

<P>&nbsp;The cause of fatness is not metabolism or genes or whatever,
but
a sick society that has based its economy on a sick lifestyle.

<P>I heartily agree with +ORC on his supermarket series. But I would
like
to supplement his views: I say that the drug industry is one of the
institutions
that makes the sick system tick. Not only for constructive ends in the
individual patient who really couldn't make it without (like me, for
example),
but for sustaining the system which is destructive to people and to the
planet. For spreading dangerous and useless drugs (the slimming drugs
are
a nice example) that damage individuals and keep people centered on
their
individual metabolic problems instead of the structural disease of the
entire society, of which they themselves are the most pitiful victims.

<P>So I offer to make it my role, in Fravia+' site, to take care of a sort of 
'sublab' on this industry. I'm thinking about an exercise - a reality cracking strainer.
There are lots of nice Web pages from the pharmaceutical industry
around, 
and they are all waiting to be cracked. Good solutions may earn the
author
a question mark ahead of (or inside) her or his name, please write me at
halcioff(at)yahoo(point)com.

<P><I>Ci?off</I>
<hr><i>
Yeah... why not? Time to organize a little the reality cracking lab anyway, isn't it?
And by all means I love the idea to crack some 'official messages' on industrial webpages... may be the whole 
<a href="exegesis.htm">exegesis</a> techniques could find an application in this context... 
Let's say, to begin with, an 'anti-advertisement' specific area, which I believe is needed, 
and -why not?- a 'food and drugs' area, with Ci?off (that seems to have a specifical interest in this) 
as coordinator, we'll see... other specific areas will follow if needs be... I just wonder 
how many will really work on this kind of stuff...</i>
