<font size=+1>Well, some of the snippets in here can in my (biased) opinion contribute to a 
 more 'deep' understanding of the recent WTC tragedy than all the bombastic and concerted 
 propaganda that our media are vomiting around. I believe it makes quite a 
 good reading for our 
 "reality cracking" section ("<font color=blue> Millions of people have 
been brought up in it. It is called religion and, for reasons which one day we 
may understand, most people fall for it (nowhere more so, incidentally, though 
the irony passes unnoticed, than America itself). Now all we need is to round up 
a few of these faith-heads and give them flying lessons.</font>"), but I may 
be wrong... and I sincerely hope this wont hurt the susceptibility of some 
reversers. Should this 
happen, any sound comment or observation will be welcome and added here...

<p>A guided missile corrects its trajectory as it flies, homing in, say, on the 
heat of a jet plane's exhaust. A great improvement on a simple ballistic shell, 
it still cannot discriminate particular targets. It could not zero in on a 
designated New York skyscraper if launched from as far away as Boston. That is 
precisely what a modern &quot;smart missile&quot; can do. Computer miniaturisation has 
advanced to the point where one of today's smart missiles could be programmed 
with an image of the Manhattan skyline together with instructions to home in on 
the North Tower of the World Trade Center. Smart missiles of this sophistication 
are possessed by the United States, as we learned in the Gulf War, but they are 
economically beyond ordinary terrorists and scientifically beyond theocratic 
governments. Might there be a cheaper and easier alternative?</p>
<p>In the Second World War, before electronics became cheap and miniature, the 
psychologist B. F. Skinner did some research on pigeon-guided missiles. The 
pigeon was to sit in a tiny cockpit, having previously been trained to peck keys 
in such a way as to keep a designated target in the centre of a screen. In the 
missile, the target would be for real. The principle worked, although it was 
never put into practice by the US authorities. Even factoring in the costs of 
training them, pigeons are cheaper and lighter than computers of comparable 
effectiveness. Their feats in Skinner boxes suggest that a pigeon, after a 
regimen of training with color slides, really could guide a missile to a 
distinctive landmark at the southern end of Manhattan Island.</p>
<p>Pigeons may be cheap and disposable as on-board guidance systems, but there's 
no escaping the cost of the missile itself. And no such missile large enough to 
do much damage could penetrate United States airspace without being intercepted. 
What is needed is a missile that is not recognized for what it is until too 
late. Something like a large civilian airliner, carrying the innocuous markings 
of a well-known carrier and a great deal of fuel. That's the easy part. But how 
do we smuggle on board the necessary guidance system? You can hardly expect the 
pilots to surrender the left hand seat to a pigeon or a computer.</p>
<p>How about using humans as on-board guidance systems, instead of pigeons? 
Humans are at least as numerous as pigeons, their brains are not significantly 
costlier than pigeon brains, and for many tasks they are actually superior. 
Humans have a proven track record in taking over planes by the use of threats, 
which work because the legitimate pilots value their own lives and those of 
their passengers. The natural assumption that the hijacker ultimately values his 
own life too, and will act rationally to preserve it, leads air crews and ground 
staff to make calculated decisions that would not work with guidance modules 
lacking a sense of self-preservation. If your plane is being hijacked by an 
armed man who, though prepared to take risks, presumably wants to go on living, 
there is room for bargaining. A rational pilot complies with the hijacker's 
wishes, gets the plane down on the ground, has hot food sent in for the 
passengers, and leaves the negotiations to people trained to negotiate.</p>
<p>The problem with the human guidance system is precisely this. Unlike the 
pigeon version, it knows that a successful mission culminates in its own 
destruction. Could we develop a biological guidance system with the compliance 
and dispensability of a pigeon but with a man's resourcefulness and ability to 
infiltrate plausibly? What we need, in a nutshell, is a human who doesn't mind 
being blown up. He'd make the perfect on-board guidance system. But 
suicide-enthusiasts are hard to find. Even terminal cancer patients might lose 
their nerve when the crash was actually looming.</p>
<p>Could we get some otherwise normal humans and somehow persuade them that they 
are not going to die as a consequence of flying a plane smack into a skyscraper. 
If only! Nobody is that stupid, but how about this. It's a long shot, but it 
just might work. Given that they are certainly going to die, couldn't we sucker 
them into believing that they are going to come to life again afterwards? Don't 
be daft! No, listen, it might work. Offer them a fast track to a Great Oasis in 
the Sky, cooled by everlasting fountains. Harps and wings wouldn't appeal to the 
sort of young men we need, so tell them there's a special martyr's reward of 72 
virgin brides, guaranteed eager and exclusive. Would they fall for it? Yes, 
testosterone-sodden young men might go for 72 private virgins in the next world.</p>
<p>It's a tall story, but worth a try. You'd have to get them young, though. 
Feed them a complete and self-consistent background mythology, to make the big 
lie sound plausible when it comes. Give them a holy book and make them learn it 
by heart. Do you know, I really think it might work. As luck would have it, we 
have just the thing to hand: a ready-made system of mind-control which has been 
honed over centuries, handed down through generations. Millions of people have 
been brought up in it. It is called religion and, for reasons which one day we 
may understand, most people fall for it (nowhere more so, incidentally, though 
the irony passes unnoticed, than America itself). Now all we need is to round up 
a few of these faith-heads and give them flying lessons.</p>
<hr color="#000000" width="25%">
<p>Facetious? Trivialising an unspeakable evil? That is the exact opposite of my 
intention, which is deadly serious and prompted by deep grief and fierce anger. 
I am trying to call attention to the elephant in the room that everybody is too 
polite - or too devout - to notice: religion, and specifically the devaluing 
effect that religion has on human life. I don't mean devaluing the life of 
others (though it can do that too), but devaluing one's own life. Religion 
teaches the dangerous nonsense that death is not the end.</p>
<p>If death is final, a rational agent can be expected to value his life highly 
and be reluctant to risk it. This makes the world a safer place, just as a plane 
is safer if its hijacker wants to survive. At the other extreme, if a 
significant number of people convince themselves, or are convinced by their 
priests, that a martyr's death is equivalent to pressing the hyperspace button 
and zooming through a wormhole to another universe, it can make the world a very 
dangerous place. Especially if they also believe that that other universe is a 
paradisical escape from the tribulations of the real world. Top it off with 
sincerely believed sexual promises -ludicrous and degrading to women though they 
are-and is it any wonder that naïve and frustrated young men are clamoring to be 
selected for suicide missions?</p>
<p>There is no doubt that the afterlife-obsessed suicidal brain really is a 
weapon of immense power and danger. It is comparable to a smart missile, and its 
guidance system is in many respects superior to the most sophisticated 
electronic brain that money can buy. Yet to a cynical government, organization, 
or priesthood, it is very very cheap.</p>
<p>Our leaders have described the recent atrocity with the customary cliché: 
mindless cowardice. 'Mindless' may be a suitable word for the vandalizing of a 
telephone booth. It is not helpful for understanding what hit New York on 
September 11th. Those people were not mindless and they were certainly not 
cowards. On the contrary, they had sufficiently effective minds braced with an 
insane courage, and it would pay us mightily to understand where that courage 
came from. It came from religion. Religion is also, of course, the underlying 
source of the divisiveness in the Middle East which motivated the use of this 
deadly weapon in the first place. But that is another story and not my concern 
here. My concern here is with the weapon itself. To fill a world with religion, 
or religions of the Abrahamic kind, is like littering the streets with loaded 
guns. Do not be surprised if they are used.</p></font>
