<i>Yep, the calculation about the real price of mineral water is quite interesting. We were recently amazed 
seeing mineral water lorries scuffling around Europa's autoroutes. You ever wondered why? 
So that you can 
buy a German mineral water 
in Portugal, or an Italian one in Germany. Like wines, you know, only here it does 
not mean nothing, 
is just bogus, induced, consumerism at its most paradoxical stage</i>

<p>You know <a

You've seen it thousand times on chocolate wrappings, plastic
bags, beer cans and (yuck!) coca-cola bottles. I remember the time
I was asking myself what it meant, and I even remember the time
when it was nowhere to be seen (in communist Bulgaria at least).
I'm not sure if this story happened the same way otherwhere, but
here's the whole story.
</p><p>
Back then yoghurt was sold in glass jars, which you washed, dried
and returned to the shop in exchange for full ones. Lemonade
(Coca-cola, and the more popular then Pepsi were not very common.
This doesn't mean that we haven't a "Generation P" :) was sold in
heavy large bottles too. They were almost as heavy as the drink
inside them and it was very hard for a kid to carry more than two.
We had some nice canvas bags for carrying such heavy things,
except the ones for potatoes, which were made from some polimere
thread and looked more like nets. Some families also had a case of
empty beer bottles, which on suitable occasions were exchanged for
a case of FULL beer bottles. Obtaining a case without exchanging
it for another was not that easy, so often neighbours would use
the "treasurous" cases of those who had one.
</p><p>
Yes, it was like that for some time, but after that the wind of
change blew, some walls were torn down, and slowly some new things
emerged in the day-to-day life. Enter Pepsi and Coca-cola, a
couple of the main characters of this story. They were still in
their cool-looking glass outfit then, excited for entering a new
scene and all that. Some old characters were changing their image
though.
</p><p>
Yoghurt first. Before the change there was ... well yoghurt. After
that was the yoghurt of that milk farm, the yoghurt of the other
milk farm ... free market, you know. And some of the "new farms"
were no longer packaging in glass. They used plastic - easy to
carry, easy to throw - no washing and carrying back to the store -
the housewife's dream!
</p><p>
Some time passed, and the new trends became normal practices.
Coca-cola introduced the "innovative" plastic bottles, but for some
time you could still return your empty glass bottles and buy
others. But yoghurt glass jars were no more. Everybody bought it
in plastic jars and didn't realise that besides yoghurt he was
buying an _absolutely useless_  plastic jar, which he threw
immediately.
</p><p>
Later, when <a href="modernze.htm">tap water became almost
undrinkable</a> there appeared plastic bottles of mineral water.
At the moment a 1.5L bottle costs 50 units in a store (important
here is the ratio, not the absolute currency value), ~20 units if
you buy a whole truck and 0.5 (!) units for cubic meter of water.
This makes 0,00075 units per 1.5L - and all the other expences are
for the plastic bottle, transportation and advertisement.
</p><p>
Yet, the transition from "swappable" glass to disposable plastic
containers was not the worst. There was a "backwards" transition
too: things which were sold in plastic were more and more packaged
in glass. Mayonnaise for example - the price of the "plastic" one
is *half* of the price of the "glass" one - of course, you pay for
the glass container, which is TIMES more expensive than the other
and after you eat the mayonnaise you THROW it out! And the plastic
bag you carried (and paid for, albeit indirectly) it in from the
supermarket. And the beer cans.
</p><p>
The "glasswards" trend also dominates the alcohol and parfume
markets - they do it mainly to make forgeries harder, I think, but
still they often sell you a fancy bottle with a fancy one-way
valve, which makes the thing unusable afterwards. Of course here
we can also see the "pay more for package" principle in action -
danzka vodka comes in a metal bottle "and differs significantly
from other vodkas in their normal glass bottles". In the price,
sure.
</p><p>
So here's a translation for you: "Pleace recycle" = "Please buy
our useless crap and please make sure you throw it away immediately 
afterwards"!
</p><p>
And what about one-use photo cameras? You know, those little boxes that 
you buy, use and throw away, with lenses and objectives and shutter and 
everything. What about disposable gsm? Am I wrong or 
-already now- the new GSMs are not as sturdy and long lived as the old 
ones? An "old" nokia 5110 beats hand s down all the more recent products, 
doesn't it? Maybe that's the reason they want you to return the old models&nbsp;:-) 

<br><br>What comes
next - cellulose cars? For the commercial bastards is no longer
enough to sell you junky items which won't last long (I've seen
20+year-old stereos which still work like new!). Now they want to
sell you junky items, which you should throw away almost immediately.
And please, do it on the proper place for that - see the little
green symbol?
</p><p>
<i>P.S.  Do an instructive test on the yogurth you yourself consume, for instance on <a
href="http://www.dannon.com/pages/dannon_browser.cfm/mode.article/
jid.15/aid.179/">Dannon</a> ('true yoghurt' my ass!) - open the
yoghurt and leave it for a day outside the fridge. It should
become sour and uneatable. If not - forget about this brand - it
is probably made of other bacteriae and/or full of conservants. Of
course, the best yoghurt is home-made - make it from proven
yoghurt with alive(!) (lacto)bacillus bulgaricus, only with
full-fat milk. After hangover or just a bad day, try "ajran" - add
and stir water to the yoghurt until it has drinkable density and
add salt to taste. Cheers!</i>
