<font color=blue>The web is text</font>. All images and sounds and frills notwithstanding, the web is text. It was 
created in order to exchange and store texts. Email are texts, the whole 
<a href="../usenet.htm">Usenet</a> is in great part text...   
Perl is an 
acronym of "Practical Extraction Report Language" and was created 
to extract information from text files and prepare 
reports. Samo samo for python etcetera.<br>
It is evident: <font color=blue>because of the web</font> the 'written expression' 
has re-acquired an importance it did seem to have in part lost during the (now obsolete)    
aera of 
radio, telephone and 
television  (also known as "age of the frill-morons" :-)<br>Yes: the web 
is text, an ocean of text, a galaxy of messages and information without order, with 
dubiose autorship, with missing or misplaced references.<br>How do you 
now if the paper you are reading on a site called "university of southern Malawi" is 
a real university paper with scientific value or a complete fake that has been 
put up by a kid to prank you and thousand others?<br>No wonder that "urban 
legends" abound on the web. Trying to fix the "paternity" of a page can be 
a nightmare <i>per se</i>.<br> 
So we need means and tools to understand the real value of the texts
 we encounter.<br>Alas, in a society that has been tv-zombified for 50 years and counting
  we don't have any 
more at hand such means and tools. 
Our "passive consumer" society would be doomed if anyone would really be able to evaluate 
the authority, usefulness, and reliability of the information he finds  
(or -more commonly- he is "spooned with" by the owners of his information media).  
<br>
 An interesting way out - among other possible solutions - is to go back to the old "text-crackers" of once. 
One could  
maybe start with 
the great rethorical 
wizards of ancient Greece (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophists">Sophists and co)</a>, that 
make great reading (especially uncommented), and continue with  
the über-masters that came out of the evangelische text-exegesis Schule: the incredible <a href="exegesis.htm#intro">German medieval 
"Quellenkunde" crackers</a>  
 of the beginning of the XIX 
century.

What does 'exegesis' mean? Nothing more, and nothing less, than applying a sound 
'reverse engineering' approach on a given written text.<br><br>
This is a very POWERFUL technique, if applied to the propaganda that surrounds you. You want some 
examples? 

<ul><li>"Ministry of <font color=blue>defence</font>" (a couple of centuries ago 
they were still decent enough to call such entities  
 "Ministry of <font color=blue>war</font>"). Also called "Ministry of peace" (sic!)
 <br>I wont even go here into the known "collateral damage" 
evil terminology, referring isntead to my old  essay about  
 <a href="natoagr1.htm">Common propaganda techniques</a>. Suffice to say that names like 
"<font color=blue>desert storm</font>", given to a war campaign "against Saddam", enhance 
the sense of 
'remoteness' of such  operations, as if no Iraqi real people were involved (and dying) during them.<br>
Missile names are also interesting: (Patriot, <font color=blue>Peace Keeper</font>, <a href="http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/dumb/blu-82-riders.jpg">Daisy 
Cutter</a>, etc)
</li> 

<li> 
"<font color=blue>Employers</font>" (Gosh! There's so much propaganda hidden 
behind this term that one could (and 
probably should) 
puke.<br>In german too, 
              the original term:  "<font color=blue>Herren</fonT>" has been 
              has been "neutralized" a rather 
               turned into an
altruistic "Arbeitgeber". The same ahappened in italian with 
"Datori di lavoro" or "imprenditori" taking the place of the more spade-is-spade "padroni", while  in finnish we have 
nowadays "työnantajat" and in french, 
instead of "patrons", we speak now of  "Entrepreneurs" or "Employeurs", 
or even (sic!) "loueur d'ouvrage".<br> 
At the same time the 
counterpart of those nice "workgivers": the <font color=blue>workers</font>, the 
original <font color=blue>Arbeiter</font>, 
 have 
been already tranformed into "Arbeitnehmer": literally "those who take a job" 
(graciously offered one would suppose&nbsp;:-)<br>In english we have "employee" instead of "worker". Not even "wage earner", 
that would be putting too much weight on earning&nbsp;:-)

<a target=_top href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&as_qdr=all&q=%22flexible+workforce%22&btnG=Google+Search">flexible workforce</a>. This 
is a easy target, c'mon, you can debunk it yourself  :-)

<font color=blue>prolonging active life</font>... '<i>il danno e le beffe</i>' as 
the italians say. On such a <i>ratio</i>, a 60-hour working week would 
be a 'prolonged  active week'.<br>Try to debunk this terrible statement: "<i>Finally, 
and no less important, is the emphasis which the proposed EU-employment guidelines 
put on maintaining those who are over 50, or even 60 years of age, in active life.</i>"<br>
Yep, and let's not forget to 'activate' those that are over 70... the day they will abolish pensions they'll call it something like 
"<font color=blue>promoting seniores' 
self-assesment</font>' :-(  


</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
"Text reversing" is an almost 
forgotten Art, as I said.<br>The best reversers of this kind where a bunch of German history 
professors of the late XIX and of the beginning of last (XX) century, like Georg Waitz, 
Harry Bresslau, Ernst Dümmler,
Oswald Holder-Egger and many more... These professors had not only exceptional brains and 
capacities but also, for a lucky historical coincidence, almost unlimited resources at 
their disposal.<br>Since Germany was "young" and wanted to 'prove' its historical 'right' 
to be one of the great european nations, 
the exegesis of medieval text-sources, aka "Quellenforschung", reached 
 highs that afterwards noone never obtained again. That's the reason most 
sources originally collated (or if you prefer 'cracked') between 1820 and 1915 are 
still being re-published and used nowadays (by the degenerated historians of 
to-day, who -mostly- don't know neither greek nor latin and tend to read 
(and publish) sources in their 
translated (and non-collated) versions... a truly "barbarical" degeneration when 
you think that most HIGH SCHOOL professors around 1900 -not to mention the 
university teachers of those times- 
were able to read  latin, greek, and often enough Sanskrit as well!<br>In fact,  
text-cracking and text-exegesis, with all other "rethorical" lores, are nowadays 
sciences 
in DECADENCE! <a href="../introtoprojectorigo.htm">Maybe the web will now change this</a>... Text is again "king", difficult to 
find and hard to gather through all the false lures, in order to extract the true small 
niggets of knowledge.<br>
<bR>What was I saying? Ach Ja: Alas! 
Stupid Germans went militarist twice in half a century and - their reversing cleverness 
notwithstanding - all the German reversers went conquering their neighbours together 
with all other zombies!<br>Since they were - twice - so stupid as to attack east and 
west at the same time, the catastrophe was twice assured.<br>Alas! 
The greatest text-crackers scene of this planet was almost completely destroyed! 
In fact all those students of the 
great and older "exegesis wizards" 
that 
were able to survive 
the first World War did die during the Second World War, so that the whole Quellenkundliche scene, 
the 
'text-crackers' scene went down with them (hence - for those interested in history of the 
medieval history studies - the appearence and predominance in the fifties and sixties of 
the completely 
useless and 'frill oriented' french school of the 
"Bloch and Duby sort"  :-)<bR>Yet not 
all great text-crackers disappeared... there have been some rare exceptions, the most 
significant of them 
being represented by Adolf Hofmeister, a student of the great Alexander Cartellieri, 
 himself one of the last great wizards in text-cracking. Hofmeister survived in 
the small German university of Greifswald, and did even impart his teachings to 
a couple of younger students, Frithjof Sielaff being the most able one... 
(a very interesting) 
story... which has the added advantage of being perfectly true :-)<br><br>In the <a href="realicra.htm">reality cracking</a> section of my site 
you'll already find some outstanding essays that cover, at least in part, this same argument 
(for instance 
Martine Joly's <a href="marlbo2.htm">Rhetoric of advertisement, a "Marlboro Classic" Advertisement analyzed</a>, yet 
they are, like most anti-advertisement essays, mostly 'visual' oriented.<br><bR>

You can apply some interesting exegesis (or rather 'anti-exegesis' techniques to a SONG as well, 
as I tried to prove for my <a href="https://searchlores.nickifaulk.com/realicra/photos.htm#richard">friend Richard Matthew Stallman</a> with 
an interesting (at least in my eyes&nbsp;:-) <a href="../misterstallman.htm">example</a>.
<br><br>Nuff said, 
for now: Knowledge of the lost exegesis techniques and of rhetoric will be enough (at least I hope) 
to reverse any text black and blue, at least compared with to-days almost absolute ignorance 
of these matters (and yet I believe that our reversing techniques are 
something that would be really worth teaching in the 
schools to-day).<bR>
