<i>   This short snippet has not been written specifically for searchlores.org, like most 
other <a href="realicra.htm#lastly">essays</a>.<br>
I found it on the web, on <a href="http://www.theonion.com/">TheOnion</a>, a satirical american magazine, yet it is - imo- worth 
being inserted in our "reality cracking" section. On a similar path, you may enjoy also my  short 
"<a href="blbleach.htm">Levi's Jeans</a>" essay. <br>
    I am sure our European readers will enjoy this snippet 
as much as United States' readers... I have also added two small shortnotes and one or two links 
to clear things out "on this side of the pond" :-)<br>The important point is the following: Often enough, in dictatures like the commercial slavemasters' ones 
we are compelled to endure all over the world, sarcasm is 
a sharp cutting blade. <br><br>Enjoy!

Just because I happen to live with my four brothers and sisters
in my mom's two-bedroom South Side apartment, work at Taco Bell(<a href="asyouc.htm#one">1</a>),
and don't have a car, some ignorant types assume that I don't have
much money. But, as you can clearly see from my $220 Fubu jacket
and $95 Tommy Hilfiger sweatshirt, I could not possibly be
poor.</P>
<P>The kind of name-brand clothing I wear is very expensive. See
these Karl Kani jeans? Eighty-eight dollars. Would I spend that
kind of money on a pair of jeans if I were poor? Of course not. If
I were poor, I'd think $88 was way too much to spend on a pair of
jeans that, with the exception of a tiny Karl Kani logo
embroidered on the front right pocket, are practically
indistinguishable from a plain old pair of $25 Levi's. But I don't
think that's too much to spend because, for a well-off person like
myself, money is no object.</P>
<P>Sure, I make $5.90 an hour at Taco Bell, but that couldn't
possibly be my only source of income, could it? If my total weekly
take-home pay were only $175, why in the world would I spend
practically that much on a Nautica sweater and pair of
Timberlands? That would mean I'd have spent 40 hours slinging
<a href="http://www.universityofthepoor.org/schools/labor/labor.html">Chalupas</a> just for that one shopping trip to the mall. That'd just
be plain stupid. So, obviously, I must be rolling in dough. And I
am. You can tell by my special non-poor-people clothing.</P>
<P>Yes, it's obvious that I'm not like all those other losers who
are working at Taco Bell and living with their moms. No, I'm a
player. Take, for example, my socks. If I didn't have money to
burn, I certainly wouldn't spend $22 for a pair of basic white
athletic socks with a teeny-tiny Calvin Klein "CK" on them, would
I? Of course not. I'd need to save my cash to get my telephone
reconnected, or to pay off my loitering fine, or to help out my
mom with the grocery bill. But, luckily, I'm not in that
situation, and everyone knows it just by looking at my
clothes.</P>
<P>I'll admit it: A lot of people here on the South Side are poor.
In fact, most of my relatives are poor, including my mother and
all my siblings. Knowing that, you might assume that I don't have
that much money, either. But just look at these Lugz boots. And
look at this Sean John baseball cap. They prove that I'm in an
entirely different social class from my relatives, as well as from
all those suckers who ride the bus with me every day.</P>
<P>Except for Angela, that is. I met her Monday on the C-route.
She clearly belongs to a higher class of people like myself. I
could tell because she was decked out from head to toe in
expensive gear: Fubu jersey, Pepe jeans, and Fila shoes, not to
mention a big gold chain around her neck. Angela was holding her
two-year-old son, but he obviously isn't placing much of a
financial strain on her, as he was wearing a complete matching
Abercrombie & Fitch outfit, which must have cost around $140.
Recognizing how much Angela and I had in common, I asked her out
on the spot. We went to dinner at Denny's(<a href="asyouc.htm#two">2</a>) that very same
night.</p>

    Notes for non-American readers<br><br>   
    
    
    <a name="one"></a>(<font color=blue>1</font>): Taco Bell is a "el cheapo" 
    chain, famous in the States for its lousy salaries and rotten "mexicanish" meat. Servants' uniforms have been selected 
    from a pile of clothes that Ronald McDonald thought was a bit garish. 
    <br><br>
    <a name="two"></a>(<font color=blue>2</font>): Denny "Restaurants". Places where the service is miserable 
    (and the burnt toasts are not much better): unless you cherish cold eggs, served 
    badly by someone named "Madge", wearing support hose, who calls you  "hon" and 
    unless you enjoy  inhaling massive amounts of second hand smoke, you should avoid such  places.
