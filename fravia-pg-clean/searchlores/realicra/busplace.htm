<hr>How to sit down in a crowded 
bus!</font><br><br>
an essay by <B>H3cker</B><BR>October 2001<HR><br><i>
<font size=+1>Well, this strayeth a little 'off' the political reality cracking section (compare 
to it last month's essay by Richard Dawkins: 
<a href="flyfaith.htm">Design for a Faith-Based Missile</a>) and goes 
'back' towards some reality cracking  snippets 
we published some years ago, à la  <a href="rebodila.htm">reversing body language</a> approach<bR>Yet I do use the underground pretty oft, but I must admit that 
my own tricks to get a sitting place were rather, uh, dilettantish, before 
reading this small snippet...</i></CENTER><HR>
<P>This little essay assumes that you are living in a city, you use the 
bus,
the tram, or the metro rather frequently and you have to go many 
stations
with this way of transportation, because it is useful no matter the
conditions are.<BR>
I am living in a big city (the capital of Romania), I go to college 
every
day (almost) and I have to cover great distances, at a rush hour. I 
always
use the bus, it's alot faster (not as fast as the metro, but... here's 
my
reason --->) and alot cheaper - in fact, it's free, I never use a 
ticket, so
I don't pay. Oh well, I am a very lazy person and I am always seeking 
for
comfort. So when I'm in the bus, I am always trying to get to sit down,
whatever the conditions. And the result is that I am always getting to
occupy a seat, even if the bus is packed and full of people.
Here are my techniques. I developed them in years, it takes practice 
and
patience, but in the end you get what you want: sitting down, looking 
at the
window, admiring nice chicks while in the bus people are fighting for 
space.
(mean, huh? :-))))
<P>
<U><B>Tips and tricks:</B></U>
<OL>
<LI> Never sit in neutral places, like near doors, in the middle of the 
bus
etc. Try to get as close as you can to the seats. And I mean CLOSE. 
Never
let another person between you and your target, so that when the one 
that
occupies the seat gets up, you can immediatly conquer the seat.
<LI>
Never choose a target that is close to old people, pregnant women, sick
persons. The common sense requires that you should let them sit. Try to 
find
a place surrounded by young or middle aged, healthy looking people.
<LI>
Always keep your eyes peeled at the little "signs" that someone wants 
to get
off the seat and get down the bus. That is: <UL TYPE="disc">
<LI>looking trough the window as he/she tries to find the station where 
to
get down
<LI>closing the book (or the newspaper) he/she was reading
<LI>arranging the bags (grip them tighter) or the perce
<LI>asking other passangers about where is the station </UL>
Anyway, you get the picture. More hints can only be found by yourself, 
after
careful studying.
<LI>
Always try to occupy strathegically the places in the bus near two or 
more
(three, four) seats. Those "groups" of seats are controlled by one 
specific
position. Stay in the middle, as for one passanger gets up, you can 
quickly
take his/hers place. If you are controlling more seats, the more 
probability
will be that you will be sitting sooner. Never "control" one person 
seats,
it is a waste of time, unless you are forced to, or you've seen some
"signs", as described above.
<LI>
Always be careful at the stations with high degree of interest for the
passangers. That is: downtown, central, near malls, near universities,
theathers blah blah. Many people get off the bus there, and you should
carefully guess who (check below).
<LI>
Try to know your passangers. Just by analysing them, how they look, 
hearing
some conversations between them etc, you can learn valuable things. For
example, if you know that there will be a mall in the way, and you see 
one
of those perfumed, make-up-ed, hair died, elegant looking chicks, you 
might
guess that she may go shopping (and in most cases she is) and get off 
the
bus the next station. Go next to her seat! Another examples: passanger:
student - station: university ; passanger: worker - station: factory. 
You
get my point.
<LI>
Once you've occupied the seat, never give it away foolishly. You should
always give the seat to pregant women, sick persons, elders. Never give 
the
seat to mummies or grannies with sons or nephews that can stand on 
their own
two feet. (It happened to me once. I got up to give the seat away to 
some
granny, and she put her spoiled 8 year old bastard on the seat, while 
she
kept standing up. Bleah!)
<LI>
When desperate, and none of the tips above work, there is one solution 
that
never fails. However, it is an emergency solution, (that is, when you 
are
VERY tired) and should not be abbused. Well, when nothing works, try to 
look
sick, very sick. Go to the nearest seat occupied by an young or middle 
aged
person and ask him for the seat, motivating that you are feeling very 
ill,
or you've had surgical operation recently, or you suffer from back 
disease,
whatever. If you pick your "subject" well, he should give away the seat 
to
YOU. Satisfied? DON'T SHOW IT! Act ill, until you get off the bus.
</OL>
Well, that pretty much does it. I hope you found here valuable info. 
Happy
sitting! :)
