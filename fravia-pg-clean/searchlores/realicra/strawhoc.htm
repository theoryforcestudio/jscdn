Exegesis of European legislation texts in order to find some snippets of truth</fonT><hr width=44%>
Here a quick (and recent) example from "<font color=blue>Commission Regulation 2697/2000 of 27 November 
2000 concerning the provisional authorisations of additives in feedingstuffs</fonT>" (OJEC L319, 
16 December 2000). In this regulation you will find a quite interesting Annex: "<font color=blue>List of additives linked to a person responsible 
for putting them into circulation and authorised on a provisional basis for no longer 
than five years</fonT>", interesting because this Annex has a special column: "<font color=blue>other 
provisions</font>" that 
lets you understand how <u>dangerous</u> such additives can be, here you have 
just <u>one single example</u> out of hundreds&nbsp;:-)<br><br> 
<table border=1><tr><td colspan=5></td><td colspan=2>Min/Max mg/kg of 
complete feedingstuff</td><td><center><font color=blue>other 
provisions</font>&nbsp;:-)</center></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=2>
12</td><td rowspan=2> Astaxanthin-rich Phaffia
rhodozyma (ATCC 74219)</td><td rowspan=2 width=150>
Concentrated biomass of the yeast
Phaffia rhodozyma (ATCC 74219),
killed, containing at least 4,0 g
astaxanthin per kilogram of
additive and having a maximum
ethoxyquin content of
2 000 mg/kg.</td><td>
Salmon</td><td> - </td><td> - </td><td> 100</td><td> The maximum content is expressed as
astaxanthin.<br><bR>
Use permitted only from the age of six
months onwards.<br><bR>
The mixture of the additive with
canthaxanthin is allowed provided that the
total concentration of astaxanthin and
canthaxanthin does not exceed 100 mg/kg
in the complete feedingstuff.<br><bR>
Ethoxyquin content to be declared.
30.9.2001 ( d )</td><tr><td>
Trout</td><td> - </td><td> - </td><td> 100</td><td> The maximum content is expressed as
astaxanthin.<br><bR>
Use permitted only from the age of six
months onwards.<br><bR>
The mixture of the additive with
canthaxanthin is allowed provided that the
total concentration of astaxanthin and
canthaxanthin does not exceed 100 mg/kg
in the complete feedingstuff.<br><bR>
Ethoxyquin content to be declared.
30.9.2001 ( d )</td></tr></table>
<br>
<br>
Another interesting question would be to find out who and how often and with how much backing 
is gonna check that salmons and trouts have at least six months when they slurp their nice 
concentration of astaxanthin and
canthaxanthin... there are many more warning "hidden signals" where this one comes from...<br>

<p>
Concerning the chocolate decision by the EU:<br>
As I personally am a &quot;real&quot; chocolate lover (chocolate meaning a substance mainly
made from cocoa butter, cocoa powder (60+ %) and vanilla and carefully conched)
I have to expand a bit on this.<br>
This was a funny example on how much Nestle can actually do. The background
for this is the following:<bR>
&quot;Chocolate&quot; was something only products made from Cocoa Butter as main fat were
allowed to be labeled as. Cocoa Butter is a very special fat as its melting temperature
is somewhere around 37 degrees celsius, which is the reason why real chocolate will
literally melt in your mouth. This fact makes the 'real' stuff extremely valuable for 
the cosmetics
industry who can use it for lipsticks usw, which will sell for a much higher per-gram-of-fat
price than chocolate. Therefore Cocoa Butter is expensive. <br>
As capital holders are currently (and irrationally) expecting revenues on capital of not less
than 25% + a growth rate yearly, the Nestle management is und was under pressure to 
cut expenses
in order to raise the net profit rate. Now, "fat is fat" some people will say, so why don't we 
replace the expensive cocoa butter with some cheap plant fat. This kind of 'chocolate' 
already exists, mainly called &quot;Kuvertüre&quot; in germany, or &quot;Fettglasur mit Kakaogehalt&quot; which<br>
means &quot;fat-covering with added cocoa&quot;. Now these words would sell badly, 
as you cannot really
say &quot;tasty caramel-waffle stick deliciously rich in fat-covering with added cocoa&quot; in
advertisement.<bR>
In order to preserve the good ole 'chocolate' name (which -namen est omen- 
is established as a good-tasting and
not particularly unhealthy food) the lobbies had to sell this kind 
of quality-downgrading as an &quot;improvement&quot;
to the politicians. They said that the product would be improved as it would now not
melt as easily in your mouth (true). 
I was quite surprised when our political caste bought that lie (or maybe viceversa).<br>
<br>
Similar things are going on with beer, as breweries are trying to convey that (cheap !) corn
enhances the taste of beer. Re-labeling to sell something inferior as the original, well-known
and high-quality product is going on all the time.<br>
<p>
Considering genetically manipulated food, my personal opinion is that we have something
at hand that is very much more dangerous than nuclear technology. If you have a nuclear
fallout, after a couple of million years the radiation will be gone. Not so with genetically manipulated
crops. There is no way to guarantee that your 'non-genetically-manipulated' crop is what it
claims to be, as the rules of evolution (the most resistent plants survive) and the fact that
you cannot distinguish genetically manipulated food from non-manipulated food without a
DNA analysis will guarantee a mixing of seed crop, and therefore a slow extinction of 
non-manipulated crops. Just keep in mind that we're fiddling with a system far more complex
than your average operating system (and see how often that crashes), that we haven't 
created ourselves and of which we have no _exact_ idea how it works. Gotta love it.<br>
If you speak out against genetical manipulation nowadays, you're almost branded a traitor
to the human race as you are against developing a cure for cancer etc. with it. Ahwell, its
funny what the media can do :)
<br><br>
While I am at rambling, the media is an interesting animal. In short, by privatizing media completely
(and _ALL_ non-electronic media depend on advertisement nowadays) we basically allowed the
once-run-by-government propaganda to fall into the hands of the industry. 
Funny how things reorganize. Even as funny is how this animal always points to the real rulers.<br>
