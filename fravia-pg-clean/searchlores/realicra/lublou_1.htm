Reversing Reality, first stab at the second phase<BR>by lublou</FONT><br>

 </CENTER><i>Well,  it took two years before an addition to IcE's essay <a href="reality1.htm">Reversing Reality, a first stab</a> 
 could be published. Things seem to move on this "philosophical" part of the 
 reality cracking arena... probably thanks to the brain stirring that -Pantheon's <a href="pantfisi.htm">essay</a> has 
 recently caused.<br>Here you'll be able to read "a second stab", by lublou, an 
 interesting essay, which is imo dangerously 
 moving on a path 
 that could easily trod into the same well-trodden field 
 where during the last 5000 years (at least) all kinds of philosophes (and religious nuts) have 
 being discussing the frontiers of human Weltanschauung&nbsp;:-)<br>Enjoy...</i>

<P align=center>c or c++ WHY?... not WHAT?...</B> 
<P align=center>An Essay by lublou</P><FONT color=#000000 size=3>After I read 
the <A href="pantfisi.htm">Disjoint 
application on beliefs</A> by -Pantheon. I got so excited I had to read 
it again. I will try to introduce a brand new theory, developed from -Pantheons 
essay and highly influenced by <A 
href="reality1.htm">IcE</A>'s essay. So if this all seems confusing, 
it probably is.<BR><BR>I wish to 
agree with -Pantheon, but say it differently. I believe TAL ("theoretical analysis level") 
is a subset of RLL ("real life level"), 
that is why TAL will never describe RLL fully. When saying TAL is a subset of 
RLL my definition of RLL is as follow. RLL is what really happens, whether you 
can percieve/understand/measure it or not, and TAL chooses certain known ways of 
interpreting/percieving/measuring that which is really happening. In defense of 
this, the following. -Pantheon's marvelous example of the library states the 
following.<BR><BR><FONT color=blue>"When a book is left in the library, the 
force of the bond causes the book to draw nearer to its proper place. Left for 
enough time, the book will settle into its final place. Using our theory, it is 
possible to predict the behaviors of books within the library. Let's do an 
experiment to verify: Remove a book. I have chosen Aristotle's Categories, 
translated into English. We will refer to this book as "the subject". I removed 
the subject from its proper place, noting the energy required removing it from 
its position between two other books. I exerted a force on the subject to 
transfer it to a table across the library. I left the library determined to 
return in two days. On my return the book had transferred itself back to its 
proper position, exactly as our theory had predicted. This did not require any 
addition of energy on our part, so it must be a natural process of the 
library."</FONT><BR><BR>In Real life what happened was the librarian took the 
book back. But why didn't TAL pick that up. Someone in defense of the TAL way of 
life may say that the parameters laid down by the TAL process were 
insuficient<FONT color=blue> "left the library determined to return in two 
days".</FONT> If you hid in the cupboard and spied the book 24/7 you would have 
seen the old lady doing her thing. So what am I saying. With TAL you can only 
prove what your test parameters allow you to prove. There is a saying that 
statistics has proven that 49% of all statistics are incorrect. But not to lose 
the point -Pantheon tried to convey. Let us say the librarian's penpal from Xeon 
came to visit, saw the book laying there and put it away. Even if you were in 
the cupboard you would not have seen her since beings from Xeon constantly move 
at the speed of light-2n, and you would have believed books have bonds, and 
never have knew that the librarian had a penpal from Xeon. So what am I trying 
to say, it seems like were back where we started. Just hold the thought and have 
a look at the following.<BR><BR>I critisized the TAL test parameters and showed 
that by increasing the sampling speed, the correct observation could be made, 
but -Pantheon intended the example to be understood in terms of atomic theory, 
so I imediatly refuted my argument by changing the speed of events, to prove his 
initial point.<br><FONT color=#0000ff size=3>I<FONT color=#008000 size=3>c<FONT 
color=#0000ff size=3>E </FONT></FONT></FONT>wrote in his piece on reality 
reversing that <FONT color=blue>"What about a fifth or sixth dimension? Is 
there such a thing? "NO! Absolutely NOT!, you scream at me."I know there cannot 
be any more dimensions because I can't see them".</FONT> Where does this other 
dimension start, the dimension which explains events happening in this Reality 
we live in.<BR><BR>On this point I wish to divert even further. It has been 
said 
that "he who knows what will always be the slave of he who knows why". I am 
not going to elaborate on this because it could easily develop into an essay on its own. But what it 
means in this sense is, <BR>Q:"What is wrong with me doctor?" <BR>A:"You have 
Influeza"<BR>You are content, you pay the man his dollars, buy the medicine and 
off you go.<br>Once a thing is put in a box and labeled, most people merrily surrender to 
the flow. <BR><BR>Q:"What is energy"<BR>Einstein said E=mc^2. where c is the 
speed of light, the upper limit of everything, the constant which is used to 
explain most we know about atomic theory. And most people nowadays are content 
and go forth and create theories based on this. I believe the question "Why is 
there energy?" would be more appropriate, because it will answer all, but lets just 
stay calm and walk down one road at a time. So lets ask, why is the speed of 
light constant. Im not going to answer that directly, but rather continue with 
my point made earlier.<BR><BR>I said by increasing the sample speed, that TAL = 
RLL, and by increasing the event speed TAL once again differed from RLL. To 
explain this better I wish to use the example of a stroboscope and a turning 
wheel. If a spoked wheel is turning at a certain frequency in a dark room, and a 
stoboscope is flashing at the exact same frequency at which the wheel are 
turning, the wheel will appear to a normal person to be stationary. If the speed 
of the stroboscope is increased, and wheel speed is kept constant it will appear 
as if the wheel is turning slowly in one direction, which is exactly what will 
happen if the stoboscope speed were kept constant, and the wheel speed 
increased. <BR><BR>This process of looking at the freeze frame of a condition is 
called sampling, and in digital systems it is proven that the lowest frequency 
at which you may sample to still have an adequate representation of the real 
signal is called the Nyquist frequency and is equal to twice the frequency of 
the system under investigation.<BR><BR>Back to the strobo example. Paint a dot 
on the wheel and spin it at n revolutions per second. Set the strobo to n flashes 
per second. In the dark room the dot will appear to stay in one place, and we 
know that the strobo speed is the same as the wheel speed. Now instantly 
increase the wheel speed to 20n revolutions per second, the dot still stays at 
the same place, and you will not see any difference, you will think that all is 
the same, when in fact the wheel speed is twenty times faster. <BR><BR>As the 
speed of events increase, so must the speed of perception, otherwise there will 
be a discrepancy in interpretation. Now after all this I want to say that I 
believe that the speed of light is not constant, but in this dimension the "speed 
of perception" is limited to c. How will we ever measure/calculate a speed 
higher than c if our world around us, our dimension only allow the perception of 
speeds up to c. All speeds higher than c constitutes energy not part of this 
dimension. <BR><BR>Since our dimension is a subset of the higher dimension, we 
will never understand this dimension till we are part of the higher 
dimension.<BR><BR>Maybe then we will understand that although our chances of 
winning the lottery are 1:400,000,000,000 on some TAL interpretation, it becomes 
1 in your own real life if you are wearing a green jersey which your dead grandmother knit, on a rainy 
Wednesday, but only if you surname is Yankovich and telephone number ends in 24, 
and your birthday is a prime number, else......<BR><BR>To conclude, TAL will 
never describe RLL fully in this dimension, our path to freedom should rather be 
to never stop asking ..WHY!..<BR><BR>Cheers<BR><BR>lublou <BR><BR>(c) 1998 <A
