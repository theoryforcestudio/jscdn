<font color=gray>Reality Cracking</font><br><br><h1>Jobs and tailoring 
 (An unveiling)</H1>
by The Priest (the_priest__(at)yahoo(dot)com)<br>
20 January 1999
<bR><hR><i>
Well, let's publish this and see if it will be followed by some more Authors writing, for instance, 
some nasty reversing truths  
about all those 
"ad interim" job-agencies: thiefs that <u>steal</u> money from the jobless (did you notice how many of these 
small little agencies have sprouted around? Did you ever asked yourself why this happens 
inside the waves of the 'globalisation'? Did you know that they infact exploit 
people 
like there were no to-morrow, using all possible tricks of the trade? 
Time to crack them, wouldn't you say?), 
and, I would like to add, we still miss some good essays about 
<u>bribery and nepotism</u> (yes, "bribery and nepotism", a propos ethicality... did you know that people that 
get a job trough a reccomendation or an introduction are nothing else than 
THIEFS, that steal a salary 
that somebody else, more worthy, would else have got? Any idea how to individuate / punish / 
retaliate  against these zombies and against all those that allowed / enabled this to happen?)<bR>
All these reality (ugly) faces, all such kind of 
aspects, IMO, should be parts of our 
'simple reality cracking' muscle flexing as well...<bR><bR>
A couple of answers to some of the questions in here:<bR>
1) Ethic<br>
The ethical part of our work is IMO very important... I'm beginning to believe that 
we should take an even more clear 'ethical' point. But there have been quite a lot 
of discussion about this... No, Priest, rest assured: the power of all "ethical" 
values is well 
known among reversers (let's not forget, en passant, though, that most 'unethical' values 
seem to have considerable power as well, anyway :-(<bR>
2) Left/Right<br>
Doesn't seem to mean much to-day, yet of course reversers lean 'left' (whatever that 
really should mean) if we use the old conservative/innovative society-defenders/society enemies or 
I'm very happy with the way our society is ruled / I want to nuke all actual governments schemas... :-) Note however 
that there's considerable 'elitism' and quite a lot of cynism among us... many seem to 
think (most of the times quite correctly) that we should discard great part of 
the 'masses' quite happily, since they are already and irrimediably lobotomized by TV / advertisement / 
propaganda / whatever...<bR>OK, I'll make you an example (this comes from this evening 
european indecent "news"... broadly translatedinto english: 
"Noone knows what will happen in the next days in Iraq, after the Ramadan 
comes to its end, unless
Saddam himself will provoke the world with a missile attack against the USA-airplanes"<bR>Any average reverser
 will shrudder hearing such a Goebbelsian statement, I believe, yet... does it 
mean that we are 'left'? I don't believe so. I believe, simply put, that reversers are 
"ethical" (It could be, of course, that simply questioning today's lewd 
world means being politically left, I dunnow)<br>
3) Fravians<br>
This concept does not make any sense... you probably mean Fabians :-)</center>

<FONT FACE="Courier New"><FONT SIZE=+0>Dear Fravia<P>
<br><br>
You have shown us the possibility of recycling other
people's search
strings. I 
want to show in this essay that other people's reality
cracks can be
recycled. 
This crack is old and generally known, but it has been
diluted by
being retold 
as a children's fairy tale so that nobody really
understands how fresh
and up to 
date it is. 
<P>It is not my intention to offend anyone other than
the targets of
this essay, 
so those easily offended are warned to keep off.

<P>I remain<P>Yours sincerely<P>The Priest

<P>PS. Please forgive me my clumsy HTML. I tried to
improve it by
running it through Netscape, but I had to remove
oceans of code
afterwards, so I cannot recommend the method. I cannot
guarantee that
it is clean now. If you think it is too bad, please
feel free to edit
it into a shape more in agreement with your nofrills
policy.<P>TP<P>

<FONT FACE="Courier New"><FONT 
SIZE=+0><P>The conditions of society are such that
even software
crackers and 
reality crackers and reversers might eventually have
to apply for a
job. If you have made a sufficiently convincing
written application
you might end up with an invitation for an interview
and further
evaluations. 

<P>Every newbie is anxious before going to the first
interview. Feels
like an exam, only that there is no formal education
for it. A swift
Web search might be helpful, though.
<P></FONT><FONT 
FACE="Times"><A
HREF="<a href="http://www.excite.com/directory/careers/interviewing_tips?search=%2Bjob+%2Bselection+%2Binterview">Some tips 
may be found here</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>Some
employers are
genuinely generous, stimulating and receptive. They
focus on the work
to be done.They take pride in doing good work
themselves. They collect
around them people they believe they personally can
collaborate with
and who can collaborate with those already there. 

<P>Other employers seem more detached from the
production process - I
believe 
because they have a production-irrelevant education
(like law or
economy) and 
seem more preoccupied with money and status - and
control, slave
mastering if 
you like - than with production. They introduce
bureaucracy of the
silliest 
kind, demanding that those in the production units use
their precious
time for 
making reports instead of working. (You can read it
every day in the
Dilbert 
cartoons find the reference yourself)<P>You can see
these in
interviews in the 
business pages of newspapers or elsewhere where hot
air is blown. In my 
experience they use a lot words like "leadership",
"visions",
"teamwork" 
"rational" - well, you know. I do not think very
highly of these
people, so I 
think most of them believe their own words. But they
are also cowards,
by using 
the parrot strategy of reproducing the current and
fashionable
rhethoric so as 
not to offend their superiors and the shareholders.

<P>These "leaders" are sometimes in the market for
employing new
people, but do 
not really know what kind of people they need, and
THEIR bosses may
have so 
strict punishment systems for failure that they do not
dare even to
make their 
own independent decisions about which persons to
employ in their own
department. 
Instead, they hire a recruitment firm; a well-reputed
one. (I will say
something 
of that later) so the blame for a misplacement can be
put on somebody
outside 
the organization.

<P>(A few words about the terminology of failure: In
my terminology
failure is a 
disaster of some kind, or the chronic inability to
have the work done.
I think 
these firms have another definition of a failed
employment. Employing
a person who opposes them when they are wrong, will be
considered a
misplacement.)

<P>Whatever the reason, there has become a market for
dedicated
personnel 
recruitment firms, either by outsourcing of the entire
selection of
personnel, or (for the really big companies) to have
their own
internal recruitment firms, using the 
same methods. If you apply for a job with one of these
firms you may
be in for a 
surprise or not, depending on your level of cynicism. 
</fonT><P><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=+0><P>Recruitment
firms</fonT></fonT><FONT
FACE="Courier New"><FONT SIZE=+0><P>I hope I have
supplied enough
material below for the readers to judge for themselves
whether these
firms have a useful product, and whether the
renumeration is in
proportion to the value they provide. <P>
Every Fravian will know that financial success is more
a result of
successful marketing than of the qualities of a
product. Even useless
or superfluous products may become a financial
success. (Microsoft
Powerpoint is aspiring to be my favourite product for
the time being:
the tool for marketing of useless products, full of
visual frills. How
about a selective PP macrovirus that leaves unharmed
Word, Access and
Excel which may be buggy and overbloated, but actually
are tools for
quite some useful work?). Marketing in my opinion, is
a way of lying.
Even if every word is true, the less favourable sides
are usually
omitted or de-emphasized so that the full picture is
distorted.
Twisted. If this is done deliberately, it is lying -
which is not
nice. <P>But then for the crack.
<P>Have you heard the fairy tale by Hans Christian
Andersen about the
vain emperor? 
(The Emperor's New Clothes"

HREF="<a href="http://www.math.technion.ac.il/~rl/Andersen/emperor.html">You

FACE="Courier New">

<P><U>Synopsis:</U> The Emperor was buying a new suit
of clothes from
some criminals 
who posed as tailors. The criminals had told him that
the suit could
be seen by 
everybody, except those who were stupid or who were
incompetent for
their 
positions. They made him pay and ran a number of
trying sessions to
document the 
progress of the work. But the entire suit was virtual.
Of course he
noticed, but 
he did not dare to say anything, for fear of being
exposed (:-) as
incompetent 
or stupid. To know more of the suit he called in
various presumably
competent 
and wise persons for a second opinion. None of his
servants or cabinet
members 
dared to tell him that they saw nothing, so they were
full of praise
of the new 
suit, and the Emperor memorized their descriptions to
be able to
retell later 
what he was wearing. When he wanted to show his new
dress to the
people, he went 
along stark naked. Everybody saw the nakedness, but
nobody dared to
speak for fear of showing themselves as stupid or
incompetent, and the
joke was exposed, literally spoken, only when a child,
who had nothing
to loseb, cried: The Emperor has no clothes on! First
the child was
only quoted cautiously by those surrounding, but then
everybody
adopted the idea and cried it out loud.

<P>The recruitment people are making a virtual suit
that nobody dares
to expose. "Personality testing" of the applicants is
one of their
tools, including IQ testing , but even worse tests may
apply, for
example graphology - analysis of your handwriting for
personality
traits.

the stages. <BR>&nbsp; <UL><I>1. Job and Demand
Analysis</I> <BR>We
place 
considerable importance on the analysis of the formal
demands of the
position 
and the personality demands of the client.</UL>

<UL><I>2. Recruitment</I> <BR>We carry out the
recruitment of
candidates through 
an agreed advertising campaign.&nbsp; Mercuri Urval
provides clients
with the 
choice of advertising through print medium, Internet
advertising, or
both.<FONT

approximately one hour.<FONT FACE="Times New

<P><I>6. In-Depth Assessment</I> <BR>Unique to Mercuri
Urval, and
imperative to 
the successful placement of a candidate, is the
in-depth assessment of 
candidates.&nbsp; Candidates will spend approximately
four hours in
our office 
completing the following; a personal information
questionnaire, speed
and 
accuracy tests, and a personality assessment.&nbsp;
The candidate will
then have 
an in-depth interview with the consultant, which takes
approximately
two 
hours.&nbsp; The candidate will then receive extensive
feedback from
the 
consultant.

can see, most
of the work 
is pure secretarial work, and work leaning heavily on
the knowhow of
the client

in-depth
assessment. This 
speed and accuracy test - I should not swear, so I
will not, .... I
assure you 
by my anonymous honour and my priesthood: This test is
a classical IQ
test. The 
IQ test was designed long ago (in the
nineteen-twenties perhaps) to
identify the 
less gifted among us so that they could receive
special teaching and
become 
useful citizens even thought the odds were against it.
And then you, a
person with a higher education, will spend an hour
with tasks like
deciding whether a rectangle 
or a cicle fits best with a pentagon and a square, and
will have to
use half an hour to write your CV on a form - a task
that takes any
literate person about 5 minutes. Then you will spend
two hours with
someone who has a background in social sciences or
what not, who will
use this interview to assess your personality and
decide about your
fitness for the job with Micro$oft or Coca-Cola or the
Olympic
Committee of Lillehammer (shudder).</FONT>

<P>Here the tale ends. The slave masters have taken
over, and the poor
candidate 
is employed. The result is evaluated by the consultant
and those who
hired the 
consultants. Mercuri Urval boasts that they are
successful in more
than 95 
percent of cases. Surprising that there are any
unsuccessful
employments at all 
under these conditions. <P>Reminds me of elections
under Communism, in
which 
there was 99 percent participation, and 99+ percent
voted for the
Communist 
party. If you opposed this, you were out. It also
reminds me of the
general 
satisfaction with IBM computers long time ago, or with
today's
Microsoft Office 
and Windows 98. If you used lots of money on the
rubbish, you will
never admit 
that the consultants were stupid and incompetent or
the software
overbloated and 
buggy. And if you do, your bosses will hang
you.<P></FONT> <FONT

society, in
opposition to 
the greed of companies and individuals and states and

enough to understand what they are into, is measuring
your ability and 
willingness to accept humiliation and harrassment.
<P>If you show
yourself so meek that you go through the whole
procedure without
shouting, chances are high that you have the 
slave mentality that the employer wants from you. If
you are not; if
you are an

such methods, then
you will 
not think long about my warnings. You will probably
start cramming for
those IQ

If you have the

Find another employer. But even if you manage to keep
a straight face

"succeed" in your application, you may find a nice and
competent
employer next 
time. <P>Good luck! <P>As a priest, I should say: Thou
shalt not hate.
Leave 
them alone. Mind your own business. And I have asked
myself quite a
number of 
times: What harm do these firms do? <P>First of all:
They are spreading 
falsehood. "A speed and accuracy test": It is an
outright lie. The
personality 
testing is nonexistent, and if it were true, it would
be unethical
because it is 
a very severe invasion of the privacy of the job
applicant. They are
charlatans, 
with a completely bogus product, and they live
comfortably on the fact
that 
there is no child around to tell the world that their
product is 
nonexistent. But they reinforce the general accept in
the society for
bogus solutions, for swindle and lies. <P>Fravia says:
Damage

your list. Damage Micro$oft AND Mercuri Urval. Blow
them off the
surface of the earth. <P>The Priest
