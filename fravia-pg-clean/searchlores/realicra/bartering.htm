This is an interesting addition to the 'reality cracking' section. Haggling is indeed important, especially if, as you should, 
you try to live in a more frugal and less consumistic manner.
 Let's hope some further bargaining and haggling additions will follow. 
I tried this very approach with my doctor and he laughed, but then -not laughing any more- made a discount when 
he saw I was dead serious (and I pointed out 
how short his "visit" had been)...</i><br><br><br><br>

Bartering? At times. Bargaining? At times. Actually it's more <font color=blue>haggling</font>, isn't it?<br>
<b>To Haggle</b> v. i.: <font color=blue>To be difficult in bargaining; to stick at small matters; to chaffer; to higgle</font>
</center>
<br><hr width=55%><br>
Most of us do not live in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istanbul">Istanbul</a>. But bargaining and haggling are possible nevertheless.<br>
Did you know you could <font color=blue>save hundreds of euro</font> when you book an hotel room or rent a car?
<br><br>
If you're going to reverse the Grand Bazaar of Life you have got to learn 
how to haggle, and if you're going to chase elusive 
bargains, remember that the counterpart will always set a first 
price <font color=blue>outrageously high</font> and will often nowadays NOT expect you to haggle  
it down. But haggling it down is still possible. And great fun. With your lawjer, with your doctor and at the flea market.
<br><br>
General bargaining  tips:
<br><ul><li>
Enjoy and love the process. It's great fun and you may/will spare A LOT of money.<br>
</li><li> Get to know the person first ("<font color=blue>have a mint tea with your plumber</font>")<br>
</li><li>Never show much interest in what you want, in what the trader offers, be it a concrete object or some services: 
that is <font color=blue>your target</font>. Always play the value of your target low. Always exaggerate the value of your offer.<br>
</li><li>Let the trader tell you the price first. Never propose a price first.<br>
</li><li> Keep it delicate. Remember that if you go too low, your trader will be offended 
and never sell to you, no matter how high you may want to go afterwards. </li></ul>
<br><hr><br>

Most people DO NOT bargain. In to-days culture, haggling on prices gives -they wrongly believe- a  "scrooge" impression.<br>
Actually it's the other way round. If you DO NOT haggle you give -rightly- the impression of being an idiot.<br> 
You may be too ashamed to haggle, but in that case you are wrong. On a car sale, for instance, you can easily save up 
to 20% that you may ADD to an already <font color=blue>discounted price</font>.<br> 
You just have to know what to do, what to say, and how to act.
<br>
The first thing you have 
to understand, is that bargaining/haggling (and sometime even bartering) is present everywhere, 
from kids-parents relations to Kyoto protocol, from 
priest absolution to conglomerate mergers, from tribal meetings of the oldest warriors to on-line flirting.<br>
Human social life is based on haggling and bartering.<br><br>
Your local supermarket "barters" with you: it will use as few cashiers as possible in order to have its 
clients queuing patiently 
until they 'almost'  grow desperate to the point to throw away their 
filled <a href="slaves.htm#burstoff">chariots in exasperation and leave</a>. In that case, if clients just begin to leave, new cashiers will 
appear auto-magically. It's a bargaining procedure.<br>
Your bank "barters" with you as well all the time: it will tax your account expenditures and its 
own poor services more and more, until you 'almost' begin to search another bank. <br>
Here too, if clients just begin to leave, all account costs will 
 auto-magically be reduced.<br>Your insurance, your car dealer, your kids and your doctor do the same all the time, duh.<br><br>
Remember that everytime consumers make major purchases, the most common mistake they make is to assume that negotiating is not an option.
This is DEAD WRONG: <font color=blue>there is room for negotiation in virtually every purchase</font>.

</center><br><br>
Not everyone can haggle, but anyone can learn it. 
<br>
 
 	To begin with, find a "haggle friendly" environment, such as a flea market, 
 	garage sale or craft fair. Major retailers and online commerce sites aren't the best places to try to negotiate prices 
 	when you'r still a newbye.<br><br>

For instance practice your haggling skills
 by yourself, on a flea market: a typical beginning could look like this:
 
 <br><br>
"How much would it be?"<br>
"50 euro" usually he wont even <font color=blue>seem to look at you</font>. In fact he's already looked at your clothes to judge your wallet and is 
just waiting to see if you'll haggle or if you happen to be a complete sucker (there are a-plenty).<br>
"No, no, I mean, how much would it be <font color=blue>if I really would buy it, with real money</font>? -smile while saying this, builds confidence and 
is part of the game.<br>
"Still 50 euro... but ok, <font color=blue>since you are the first client this morning</font>, I'll let you have it for only 30 euro".<br>
Typical trick: the idea behind it is that once the trader is (apparently) so much under the 
"first" price, it isn't correct to ask for further reductions.<br>
You must have a correct answer to this: "<font color=blue>Unfortunately I don't have that much with me</font>"<br>
The trader will now play his part: "Listen, this is a very nice thing you want to buy. It would 
cost you up to 600 euro if you would have it made here. It is so cheap because it comes from my 
homecountry: Iran".<br>
The trick here is that going "personal" (a typical trader technique) the phantasmagorical sum of 600 euro will 
sound less surreal. A good counter-technique is to go immediately personal as well.<br>
"<font color=blue>My grandpa had such a nice object as well</font>".<br>
"Grandpa" if the trader is a man, "grandma" if the trader is a woman, of course.<br>
If the trader at this point stands up and moves in your direction, it means that the "real" bartering now begins.
<br>
Of course you must be ready: you have your money subdivided in your pockets: 5 euro in left jacket, left trousers front and 
left trousers behind, 10 euro in right jacket, right trousers front and right trousers behind, real money in your wallet 
that you never show to noone. In this case you may chose to go either for 15 or for 20 euro. To show your 
disponibility you can pull some coins (say twice 50 cents and one 20 cents) from your last pocket and say:
"<font color=blue>Here, that's all I have</font>".<br><br>

Now "since you are the first client this morning" was a problem from the beginning: you should always try, 
on a flea market, to go bargaining at the end of the day, when stores or booths are about to close. Especially 
traveling  merchants may want to get 
rid of their merchandise so that they won't have to ship it or have extra stock to move.<br><br>
A last advice, for flea markets: <font color=blue>don't dress well</font>! It may 
 embarrass your friebnds when you go antiquing, but you will ALWAYS get the best deal.
  Flea markets have often no prices posted. 
They look at what you are wearing, jewelry, etc. and then price the target <font color=blue>based on what they think you'll pay</font>.

size=+3>The 12 golden rules of driving a bargain</font>&nbsp;</center></td></tr></table>
</center><br><br>
Here the 12 golden rules of driving a bargain:
<br><ol><li>
Have clear objectives: What do you want to have? How much are you ready to pay? It is not sufficient to say "as less 
as possible", choose instead a concrete target price that corresponds to the value of the target. There are 
two possible approaches: you decide by yourself on the fly or you decide, as a rule, to buy only if 
you manage to go -say- 20% underneath the amount of the first proposal by the trader.
<br></li><li>
Determine clearly the "ultimate reserve" price. The maximum you'r ready to pay for the target. 
You may decide to start by offering 40 percent to 50 percent less than your maximum price. 
<br></li><li>
Learn your traders, how they act, which interests they have. Always haggle directly with the Chief, he is the ONLY 
one that may give you interesting discounts.
<br></li><li>
Build some confidence. 
First talk about something other than the price of the item you want to buy.
If necessary buy first something else, small or cheap, don't begin immediately to haggle for something 
important or expensive that you really want. 

<br></li><li>
Always be discrete: don't bargain or haggle so that everyone around you knows how much you are pulling down
the price. Remember that sellers hate "going public" with their concessions. 
When -after haggling- a item still seems to be too expensive, QUIETLY offer the trader the price you are willing to pay. 
If he says: "I couldn't possibly accept that. I will be losing too much money," he probably will haggle further rather 
than let you walk away.  Each time you walk away, they simply get crazier about closing the sale. You can 
come back later, eventually.
<br></li><li>
 Try to find out which is the "ultimate reserve price" of the trader during the haggling.
 On the contrary -of course- never let him understand  what your "ultimate reserve" price will be.
 Use your web-searching powers to find out. 
 For automobiles, for instance, find how much the dealer paid for the vehicle, 
 then negotiate a price that includes a fair profit for him (and a huge 
 discount for you). Remember that a "fair" profit is just around 1 euro for every 50 euro on sale (so 100 euro for 5000 euro and so on 
 tipically 200-300 euro <font color=blue>MAX</font> when you buy a car).
<br></li><li>
Flinch! 
 The most common tactical mistake that consumers make is to remain calm in the face of their counterpart's proposals. 
 <font color=blue>It's better to flinch</font> 
 Always appear shocked and surprised by any "outrageous" offer. 
 You might think a stoic demeanor looks professional, but in the haggling business it will cost you.
 <br>
 Ask your enemy for guidance - a good tactic: "<font color=blue>I can't afford this price. Could you offer a discount, please</font>?"
<br></li><li>
 Use wisely the time. Time is your ally. Traders are often, after a long haggling, pretty happy that they can 
come to a bargain, and are ready to leave a litle more. A long haggling WITHOUT a conclusive sale 
is just lost time for them (but also for you, unless you'r doing it in order to learn&nbsp;:-)<br>
When buying a car, you'r not supposed to have the trader making more than 200-300 euro profit on the price... if your 
haggling has the sellers losing just one hour, that's quite a good profit for him 
if he sells, that's quite annoying for him if he doesn't. Take advantage of this&nbsp;:)
<br></li><li>
 Try to find some defects in your target, but do not exaggerate or heavily underline them: just point them out discretely, as if 
speaking to yourself.
<br></li><li>
 Always exaggerate the value of your offer and always deny the value of the traders' offers. Use humor for this, it often pays out.
<br></li><li>
 Run around the end-price. When the difference between offer and counter-offer begins to be very small, it means that the 
deal is near. Here you have a chance to add something more: "<font color=blue>just give me the batteries as well and I'll take it</font>".
However never offer to split the difference in price. Always wait for the other side to split the difference; 
it gives your counterpart a feeling of winning and then, if you manage to split the difference again, it'll be in your favor.

<br></li><li>
If you encounter big difficulties for your target, and if you notice that the deal is drifting away, just <font color=blue>wide 
the offer</font>: "<font color=blue>And what's the price if I buy THAT object as well?</font>"
</li></ol>

<table border=1 width=88%><tr><td bgcolor="#C6E7C6"><center><font
size=+3>More haggling advices</font>&nbsp;</center></td></tr></table>
</center><br><br>
Here some more advices:
<br><ol><li>
 Imply that you're going to "shop around." This frequently has dramatic results.
<br></li><br><li>
The fair market value for any item at a flea market 
or garage sale that is not collectible is usually <font color=blue>about 1/4 the retail price</font> - less if it's damaged, 
more if it looks or is new or still originally packed.
<br></li><br><li>
Special hotel discounts<br>
Always call hotels directly. Don't call the 800 or similar reservation lines, when booking a hotel.
<font color=blue>ALWAYS</font> ask about special discounts when booking a hotel. If they have some, and 
they almost always have, they wont tell unless you ask. Check everything on their web-site PAST DISCOUNTS may be 
very useful when haggling.<br>
Once they tell you there is some kind of discount, ask if they can do better than that, if not tell them you'll call them back after having 
shopped around in other hotels. Chances are you'll really get the absolute minimum price they can do for you.
<br></li><br><li>Wangle free upgrades!<br>
Thousands of holidaymakers every year get five-star service at three-star prices simply by 
wangling an upgrade. And - more important -  this is quite easy to achieve: just try it out 
by yourself: ring several travel companies posing as an ordinary punter. First, ask for rates for standard 
accommodation and then request the next grade (or two) up for nothing. 
Many will  go for it: you will be amazed at the results.<br>
If you can hold your nerves, <font color=blue>the best deals are available late afternoon of the day required</font>, when hoteliers are 
itching to fill empty rooms. Generally, <font color=blue>the further ahead you're booking, the less likely you are to manage an upgrade</font>.
<br></li><br><li>
Before agreeing to a price, pause, tilt your head and look like you're doing massive calculations with your budget. 
Wait about 30 seconds to see if he'll give a lower price. Either accept or slightly raise your offer.
In that case keep smiling and make up stories like: "<font color=blue>Its for my sister whos about to get married</font>"
<br></li><br><li>
Watch out for the "guilt" trick.<br>
In case you haven't noticed, every desk in the dealer's sales department is covered with photographs. And if he's selling cars,  
not photographs of cars, as you might expect, but photographs of children and teenagers. 
Midway through negotiations, a good salesperson will bring the matter up.  "<font color=blue>Little Johnny's going 
to need some braces next month</font>" or "I've got three beautiful daughters, all of them in college."  
The commission the miserly dealer pays them ("their only source of income") comes up next.  
A smooth operator <font color=blue>will soon have you feeling guilty for trying to hack away at the commission they desperately need for little Johnny's braces</font>.  
You don't fall for this because you are
aware that they make a reasonable profit and you know this is a manipulative attempt to 
send you on a guilt trip.  Ignore this tactic, or reverse it with gusto and irony: "<font color=blue>I need a car like this 
to have enough space for the mechanical lung of my youngest son</font>" or somefink on these lines.

size=+3>How it really works</font>&nbsp; (by Old haggler)</center></td></tr></table>
</center><br><br>
Imagine you go to Jaipur (Rajastan), in order to buy some cheapo <a href="http://www.mmgems.com/emerald.htm">pakistani Emeralds</a>.<br>

Of course you have to know the real market value of the stones you want to buy, 
and you have to know your stones cold  (<font color=blue>4 Cs</font>: Cut, Carat, Colour and Clarity), la va sans dire.<br>
<br>
In case of pakistani 'swat valley' emeralds (be careful to avoid those of the "smudged" clarity coming from the Afghan Panjshir Valley, 
and -my advice- only buy pakistani emeralds 
in India -that means Japur- IN ORDER to avoid the Afghan crap), 
chances are that you'll be able to cover your plane ticket 
 and your expenses and also be able to roam all of beautiful Rajastan for free, maybe even into wondrous <a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=Jasailmer&num=100&hl=en&hs=617&lr=&c2coff=1&rls=en&sa=N&tab=wi">Jasailmer</a>.
 How?   
Just re-sell <font color=blue>a small amount of the emeralds you have bought</font> once you come back (note how precious stones have the 
advantage that don't take much space and 
you can hide them wherever and whenever, even during wars, hurricanes or sudden devaluations&nbsp;:-).<br><br>
Yet, amazingly enough, even when everyone and his dog knows the following bartering game, 
similar transactions will often enough run always around the following well-trodded paths...<br><br>
<center><font size=+2>A typical "emeralds" transaction</font></center><br>

You will be  offered a seat and something to drink.  Point out that you have been in their store, in this very store,  
many many years ago (be vague about the exact date) and already once upon that time you <i>really</i> 
did admire their wonderful selection back then, and add with sincerity that you  are now <i>really</i> impressed with the variety 
of items that they have in offer nowadays. This '<font color=blue>My gosh, you <i>really</i> did develop a lot over time</font>' trick often works.
<br> <br>

Comment that you purchased -say- "a necklace and some rings" the last time you were there (depending on what you see around you). Be vague, duh.  
<br><br>
They will welcome you  back to Jaipur and to their store.  Have another tea, sip it slowly and keep your naïv eyes simply hovering around. 
Don't say nothing for 
as long as it will be necessary. When the silence will be unbearable, the trader will speak to you.
<br>
Show some (tired | bored) interest on something he'll shows you. Move him slowly, and without him noticing it, towards your 
real target (say a set of cut <font color=blue>and unmounted</font> stones).<br><br>
Have now the sales person pull out your targets from the glass case, or from the safe, or from wherever they might be. <br>
Look at them warily, but show just a very vague interest. Have a good deep look  nevertheless, by all means. It's still a game.
The better they understand that you know what you are looking at (supposed you 
do know what you are looking at) the less outrageous their first haggling price will be. At the same time you should not show that 
you are interested in a given target. Ask them if they have good Afghan Lapislazuli, just to play ball. Then pick again 
one of the good emeralds (but not the best one) and look at it thoroughly. Now is the moment to bring out your eyeglass jewel lens, but 
still act very casual.<br>
He/she will remark that you <i>really</i> have <font color=blue>a great taste</font><br>
  Inquire about the price: "<font color=blue>special price for my foreign friend</font>: 6000 euro".  
  Now in the case of this set, this is waaay off the mark, but you of course have to know it. Let's imagine, so that you can understand the following,
   that 
  you value the set at around 2000 euro value <font color=blue>once you are back in Europe</font>, and around 600/800 euro value 
  in Jaipur itself.

<br><br>Look a little shocked and dazzled, then calmly reply: "<font color=blue>It is truly a beautiful set, but 
I just cant afford it for this price</font>" . Never ever say "<font color=blue>you'r a thief!</font>". 
<br>
The sales person will reply something like "How much do you want to pay?"  
<br>
Answer: "<font color=blue>What is your <i>really</i> best price?</font>"  
They will come back with something like "3000 euro" or something similar, between one half and one quarter less than the initial 
price (depending "how suckerly" you did look like).  <br>
Thank a lot for showing the target to you, begin making your preparations to leave, and again 
state that you "simply cannot afford it for that price".  Add something 
like: "<font color=blue>It is just out of the price range for a poor teacher</font>" 
or something on these lines.
Continue with some 'matter of fact' teaching info: "<font color=blue>Not all foreigners are wealthy, 
as I am sure you realize...  I saved and saved for years to be able to afford this trip 
to India... and while worth every cent, I just cannot afford this beautiful emeralds set for <i>that</i> price</font>".

<br>
Often you'll hear the seller  say: "<font color=blue>Let me phone up my boss</font>". <br>
The seller will disappear for a while (boss is actually in another room). 
Five minutes later, he/she'll come back and state: "<font color=blue>My boss said that we could sell it at 2000 since business 
has been rather bad</font> due to (the weather | the war | the unrest | the terrorists | the moon)"

<br>
Immediately reply, but be kind and gentle: "<font color=blue>That is so very generous 
of yours, and <i>really</i> worth every cent of it, but my teachers salary just doesnt accommodate 
making such a major purchase right now</font>".<br>
Now lower your head and say "to yourself": "These emeralds are indeed  very beautiful, but 
I cant afford them this time..." -and now to the salesperson: "<font color=blue>maybe I will be back in a few
 years and maybe I will have more money to spend on such beautiful luxury items!</font>". 

<br>
The trader (may | will) say: "<font color=blue>Let me see what I can do</font>".
<br>  He/she will go back to some closed office and disappear. Out of it 
will now pop the "<font color=blue>big boss</font>" smiling and very well dressed.  
<br>
He (may | will) say: "<font color=blue>I really want you to have this beautiful set, 
let me see what we can do. I hope you'll come back again and send your friends</font>" (and he'll smile all the time).<br> 
He will consult his books, his PDA, shuffle around, and then write down a number -say- 1000 or 1200 on a piece of paper.
<br>
He will  hand to you the paper snippet, in great secrecy and confidence. 
<br> He will state: "<font color=blue>That is <u>the lowest</u> I can go</font>".
<br>
Now is the moment you <i>really</i> have to decide.  

<br>Either that IS the lowest price that  you will   be able to get him down to, or it is not. It's up to you to judge. 

<br>
If you know what you'r buying, and if you know that he's still making a decent profit, BUT you are positive 
that you'll make a decent 
profit as well, just go for it and move to the next shop. <br>
Else give him your hotel-address and tell him you'll have to think about it, you want to look around a little and
you will be back tomorrow (and move to the next shop anyway&nbsp;:-).<br>
Chances are <font color=blue>he'll not call</font> - if you exaggerated - <font color=blue>or he will call</font> if you didn't. <br>
Anyway you'll learn something about haggling&nbsp;:-)<br>
