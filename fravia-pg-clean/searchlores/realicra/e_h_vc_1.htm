[vc] PART ONE: wwwizard of oz
<br><br>
Once I intended to write an essay with the title: What if fravia was 
a bot? Well, the idea behind this rather amusing question is that 
sometimes sitting in front of the searchlore page i feel like participating
in a turing-test. This may sound strange, i know, but i guess the roots lie
in the "humanised" read "merchandised" web. When you find a site, that
has information without the label "for free" or "enter your e-mail-adress", 
without ten-thousand flash-animations or banners you feel entering a
non-human world, i.e. a world that doesn't pay attention to "looks", to 
the way information is displayed ("displayed", NOT "structured"!). 
But at the same time (maybe through the wizard-of-oz-technique?) this web "feels" 
human. Now how does he do that?
<br><br>
It was funny, thinking that fravia might be a bot. For me it was very easy, 
because we never met, I have never seen a picture of him. Or maybe I did, but
it had another name written under it. But now he published the <a href="../milano/milano.htm">Milan papers</a> - 
he published, therefore he is. My turing-thesis proved wrong. ;-)
<br><br>
Flash to another topic, (i'm coming back on this): the web has a physical 
layer (i count here all technical aspects) and an ideological layer (beyond 
every information there is an "ideology" resp. an intention). Rather
interesting, "matter" and "mind" mingle together and this makes searching so 
difficult: you cannot keep them apart (a certain community may communicate over 
http or over nntp, but even if
it is the "same" community, for a searcher there is a difference of technique). 
So in order to understand it's structure you need two coordinates, ie. 
what i called in this case "matter" and "mind". The third was shown here
http://www.searchlores.org/milano/growth1.jpg but the emphasize lies on 
the vector: you "see" statistically that the web grows, you "think" it will
continue like this. Searching has much to do with this "thinking", with this
future-aspect of the web. Where will information be, rather then where has 
information been up to now? 
<br><br>
Now this question is not as theoretical as we might think. The web migrates, 
and it NOT a technological migration (bandwith etc). And here i come to speak
again about fravia the robot :-). I asked myself why I felt attached to this 
website searchlores, and some of the answers i found lie in the keywords 
1. feedback, 2. anonymity and on the third place information. For feedback 
I guess many of us have felt the same way: looking on monday if fravia has 
updated the news-page. and if he didn't (or they didn't) I asked myself: 
now why is THAT??? :-) <bR>
Then 2.: i didn't need to give any information about me (this is the quid pro 
quo of hannibal lecter: what i give is what i get, in this case: anonymity). 
This may seem of no great importance (because nobody gives the real name in
paysites anyway, duh!), but asking for a NAME a hierarchical structure is 
established: while in paysites (i mean not only sites, where you "pay" to 
receive information, but also where you "pay" time to get it - bec. of 
banners etc.), so, while in paysites all the structure of "power" lies 
somewhere in the olympus, from where we mortals are directed towards 
communication - certainly the communication THEY, the unseen GODS want - in 
an anonymous site you don't feel this gap. Hm. A rather prometheian view. 
<br><br>
This is the direction towards migration is intended. I don't know if you 
read the future of the web totally in the big programming books or if you 
find it in the slim marketing handbook designed with word2000-cliparts. I 
fear for the second. And the problem is, everything that happens is very natural. 
Humane. The name is "virtual communities". 
<br><br>
People need communication. I was taught (during my literature-study) the 
example with the proto-language: people wanted to see what language children
start talking, if they are NOT taught any language - is it the biblic hebrew,
is it latin, is it greek? (greek, not GEEK!!! :-) well, the children died,
and so we learned that people cannot live without communication. Well. 
Anyway, we, the mortals, need communication, so we get some framework 
to communication. And thus we have everything: from chat to webrings, from 
muds to the virtual community of the scubadivinggolfplaying pokemon-fans (Note: 
if you use these keywords in altavista, you even get some pages! among them, the
girlsite studdybuddy. but pleeeease, dont search for it unless you want it 
on the portalpage of all searchengines :-). 
<br><br>
Ok, there's lot of irony in here. The problem is, that it is very natural to 
exchange information, so it's being taken into the marketing program. it is
natural to build knowledge-clusters, so this is used in order to make 
some business. How do you structure this business?
<br><br>
It goes like this: 
<br><br>
[END OF PART ONE :-)]<br>
[PART TWO]
<br><br>
[vc]: PART TWO: the silenz of the l@mbs  
<br><br>
It goes like this:
<br><br>
You get money if you give something in exchange. This "something" is power
(and since knowledge is power ... you can give information, too). It is also 
the power to be in a group (milleniumgroup), it is the power to know more 
things than others, or, for instance,to know where to buy things cheaper. It
is also the power to know where you don't have to pay with time for the 
things you get.<br>
now let's say you create a virtual community: you need users. you get 
users by giving away this "power". you get more users. this users start 
giving too. you create topics, sub-topics, sub-sub-topics, active lists,
passive lists (people may participate in information-exchange without 
interfering, unless they are not "members"). you start to promote interaction
between members. this creats more information, more topics, this makes also
loyality. at the same time, you gather information about the public, and 
you use it on the public again: how to get more members of the community, 
how to publish more information etc. So let's say Harry and Mary will stick 
to this community because in another community there is no Harry and Mary, i.e.
Harry and Mary won't have the same functions. There, they won't be seen as 
members. So they stay loyal (Hagakure!) At the same time, you get also some 
general information if you like: a specialised community is a club, and is 
not very attractive to zombies. It's obvious why.
<br><br>
I won't give more rules about how to get more users. They write books about 
it. But 2 things are interesting: 
<br><br>
1. this process is, as i said, very "natural". I can describe this by an 
example: a tree grows, get branches, get leaves, get fruits etc. This is 
nature. But when I plant a tree, and plant a marketing-expert near it, and give
him the function to tell the tree: now get branches, now get leaves, cause it 
is a very good market-constellation, now is the moment to give some fruits for 
the public, this is for me an artificial growth. The growth of the web is 
partly natural, partly artificial. It is very difficult to define each, 
and to separate them.
<br><br>
2. but this is not our problem, and this is the second interesting thing. 
In order to define our position in a changing web we need some coordinates.
Again we have the physical structure evolving, and we have the ideological
structure changing. To get to the information, we must know "how", but also 
"where", and this is the "mind"-part. Let me quote from a marketing book 
that deals with virtual communities (it's an american book, but i have the 
text only in german, so i won't it translate mot-à-mot): "the first fans of 
online-networks (esp. the internet) were against the commercial use of the net,
and some of them do it even this day [no comment]. But virtual communities
and commercial applications don't exclude each other. The virtual community 
builds the unique framework for business, because like this users exchange 
in a better way information. The result is a reverse / inverse market 
[reverse is a too nice word for that], where the customer has the 
businesspower." etc etc. <bR>
It's an example of words that say one thing and mean another. a free network
gives information, and thus gives power, thats true; but businesspower ist 
only a part of power, but this argumentation doesn't doesn't take this 
into account: build a [vc] as a framework, get users, 
multiply them, let them be little businessmen. 
<br><br>
I think information is not a "businessproduct". You get information <br>
1. when you earn it 2. when you're ready for it. You don't hold it just <br>
1. for the sake of it 2. for business purposes. 
<br><br>
To resume: as a prediction, information will be found as 
"clustered knowledge" or as "herded information". The shepherd will 
take care of the little white innocent info-sheeps. That means that the woolfie 
aka searcher will start to change strategies. Information changes it's shape: 
persons hide behind groups, groups hide behind information these groups 
provide. The problem is not if this is good or bad: it is. More then ever this
means to search for the lost sheeps that doesn't fit in the herd: lost links, 
outside linkers, anonymous information, anything that is beyond the most 
common thing the web brings: entertainment.
