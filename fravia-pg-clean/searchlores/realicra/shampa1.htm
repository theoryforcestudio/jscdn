Reversing Shampoo
<p>
  I didn't actually crack the shampoo scam, all I did was write this. But as with 
  any other protected thing, at least somebody knows the truth all along. 
<p>
  The truth here is that shampoo's bad for your hair. It cleans out dirt, but 
  also the oil that makes your hair shiny and strong. However shampoo's sold as 
  something your hair really needs, and the truth is suppressed. 
<p>
  There are several common sorts of soapy things. They attract oils by electric 
  charge, allowing the oil to be emulsified with the water. For some reason, 
  these 
  cleaners are themselves made from fats. Soap is made from animal or vegetable 
  oil, 
  and detergent is made from mineral oil. Detergents can be made more powerful. 
  Shampoo is detergent, just like dishwashing detergent, bathroom cleaner, and 
  engine block cleaner. 
<p>
  People used to use soap to wash their hair, as well as their dishes, clothes and 
  bathrooms (and horses, before there were engines.) Soap was better suited to 
  washing hair, because it didn't remove so much of the oils that are naturally in 
  hair. <bR>
  But the water supply slowly changed. It's now generally more alkaline, which 
  people 
  call hard water. When this started happening, soap didn't work so well. The 
  chemicals which make water alkaline make soap stop lathering well, and form 
  insoluble scum (eg. the ring in the bath.) So soap got less and less effective 
  for all 
  its cleaning uses. I guess the water was always pretty alkaline in some places, 
  so 
  soap was never an ideal cleaner. Around the beginning of the twentieth century, 
  household detergents became available. Detergents have no problem with alkaline 
  water, so they were really popular. They soon became cheaper than soap, too.<br> 
  So 
  that's why people stopped using soap for almost everything, and started using 
  detergents. Detergents are excellent cleaners for most uses. 
<p>
  If you've tried using soap to wash your hair, you probably know how your hair 
  goes 
  all rough and tangly. This is worse if your water's harder (more alkaline.) I 
  moved 
  recently, and suddenly started having problems using soap in my hair. The 
  problem 
  is that hair reacts to acids and alkalis. 
<p>
  Each hair has little scales, like scales on a snake or shingles on a roof. Acid 
  makes 
  the scales lie down flat, which makes your hair shiny and smooth. (Ever heard 
  that 
  lemon juice is good for your hair?) Alkali makes the scales stand up, which 
  makes 
  your hair look dull and feel rough and tangly. Therefore hard water, which is 
  common these days, makes it harder to wash your hair. If you use soap to wash 
  your hair in hard water, then the combination of your hair's scales standing up 
  and 
  the soap forming scum makes your hair into a terrible mess. Then, since your 
  hair's 
  all tangled and rough, it's impossible to rinse out all the soap, which makes it 
  look 
  terrible. 
<p>
  Shampoo, being detergent, can rinse out of your hair fine even in alkaline 
  water. 
  That's its only good point. Its fundamental, but covered up, bad point is that 
  it's very 
  harsh, and damages your hair permanently. Conditioner was soon introduced as 
  people noticed that shampoo sucked the oils out of their hair dry and left it 
  all dry and 
  brittle. Conditioner puts artificial oils in your hair, and they stay their 
  just long enough 
  so that you don't associate the damage to your hair with the shampoo that caused 
  it. <bR>
  You have to wash your hair every day, not because it always gets dirty so fast 
  but 
  because the oils from the conditioner don't last and have to be replenished. 
  Conditioner wasn't used until shampoo came about. 
<p>
  But the real cheat in shampoo is when it's sold as being especially good for 
  your 
  hair. Expensive shampoos are in a way better, but only because the conditioner 
  that 
  comes with them is better at covering up the damage done by the shampoo. The 
  actual shampoo itself is pretty much the same as any cheap shampoo. The 
  professional formula, which will nourish your hair and make it grow more 
  healthy, 
  with vitamins and natural nutrients, gentle seaweed extracts, jojoba oil. . . . 
<p>
  Remember that your hair's dead. That exposes half of shampoo advertising as 
  lies. 
  Remember that shampoo is just detergent. That shows that most of the remaining 
  half is lies too. Remember that the oils your hair needs come naturally out of 
  your 
  scalp, as they've been doing for thousands of years before conditioner was 
  invented. When you think about it, nothing that is claimed about shampoo and 
  conditioner is true. 
<p>
  In a way, we really do need conditioner, as advertising implies. But the real 
  reason 
  why we need it is because our hair gets damaged by shampoo. This is just 
  another 
  case of using lies to help a bad product (shampoo) gain dominance over a good 
  product (soap), then introducing another product (conditioner) to compensate for 
  the 
  bad product's faults, and then tricking people into accepting huge price 
  increases 
  once they forget the good product. 
<p>
  The only good thing about shampoo is that it doesn't work any worse in hard 
  water. <br>
  Does that ever get mentioned in advertising? The rest is lies, to fool you into 
  paying 
  $10 for a $1 bottle of perfumed detergent. 
<p>
  What to do 
<p>
  Soap is good to wash your hair with. Forget all the dregs of misinformation 
  spread 
  by shampoo manufacturers, and forget that soap is "harsh". Remember that the 
  problem with using soap is in the water, not the soap. You just need to solve 
  the 
  problem of the hard water, and soap is fine to use. I can recommend two ways. 
<p>
  If your water's not too hard, just substitute soap for shampoo, and use any old 
  cheapish conditioner. The conditioner will make the scales on your hair lie 
  down, 
  and let the last of the soap get rinsed out. You might have to experiment with 
  different 
  soaps and conditioners. Maybe some conditioner which is pH balanced is best. 
  Some "good ol" plain soap with no added water and perfume is probably best. 
<p>
  Otherwise, you can add some weak acid at some point in the washing process. 
  Since you need just a tiny amount, even cheap vinegar will do, without leaving a 

  smell. You could make a soap goo out of soap and water, and add a bit of lemon 
  juice. You could have a jug of water with a teaspoonful of vinegar in it, to 
  rinse your 
  hair with after soaping. Or how about pouring it into a plastic squirty bottle, 
  so you 
  don't spill it. 
<p>
  Another good thing is oil of rosemary. It stimulates your scalp, to encourage 
  the 
  natural oils to flow. Actually I haven't worked out how to get it onto my 
  scalp, since 
  there's all that hair in the way, but I've heard it's possible. 
<p>
  So in summary, shampoo had a legitimate claim as an alternative for soap. But 
  now 
  it's not sold by that claim, it's sold by lies. Soap's better for your hair, 
  and you can 
  still use it if you compensate for hard water.
