<H3>Example 2: Landlord vs Tenant: a "text-exegesis" crack</H3>
<br>
by VK , with a small exegesis addition by fravia+<br>
21 September 1998
<hr></center>
Fravia+, having read your "surreality cracking" <a href="necrophi.htm">paper</a> today I send you a
"real surreal" example of my own. I actually attempted text-cracking
this letter a few days ago when I received it (yes it is a real
letter). It was only today that I read your surreality paper - it was
only today that you published it. I consider this a far simpler
example than your own, but it surely is an example of a, as you say
<I> "ductus subtilis, where the Author simulates an opinion ... with a
concealed aim ... to obtain in his audience a quite different
effect."</I> In this particular example I consider that this is
attempted largely by means of the structure as opposed to content.
Here I first set the scene - this document must be understood within
it's wider context - followed by the document and my own text-exegesis 
comments.

<HR WIDTH=30%><H2>CONTEXT</H2>
<br><br>
This is the third occasion that my landlord has attempted
to evict me from my
rented home and I've previously employed solicitors to fight these
actions. My defence is fairly complex as it's a legal
argument, and the court
date for the possession hearing is now nine or ten days away.
<P>
I have replied to the court summons stating that the notices seeking
possession are not valid for reasons that don't need to be detailed 
here. This letter arrives after
the court has sent a copy of my defence to these 'solicitors'.
<hr>
<H2>TEXT</H2><br><br>
The letter reads
<P>
Dear Sirs,
<P>
RE: MY LANDLORDS FULL NAME - V - MY NAME<BR>
CASE NO: AB12345
<P>
Recently we received a cheque in an envelope without any covering
letter. The cheque is for £52.00 dated 26 September 1998 issued by
Abbey National and it is payable D.Gordon and gives the reference
number VK/Gordon. You must appreciate that there are several people
working in this office and we have got a number of files. We would ask
you that in future if you send any cheque or any document to this
office you should send a covering letter making it clear that it
originates from you and with which particular case or file you are
sending the name of the parties and also stating exactly why you are
sending that document or cheque. If you do not follow the procedure
which we have described then we regret that we may not know for what
purpose the document or cheque has been sent.
<P>
We note your reply to possession is silent whether you agree or
disagree with the arrears of rent set out in the Particulars of Claim.
Would you please let us know whether you agree with the figures. In
case you disagree with the figures then please explain why and how
much amount you admit.
<P>
In the reply you say "payment of rent were initially delayed in order
to force the landlord to carry out essential repairs". We hereby
require you to supply us with details of each and every essential
repair you are referring there, exactly what was (inserted manually
<B>in</B>) disrepair<s>ed</s> and when you reported it to the landlord
and when the work was carried out.
<P>
Yours faithfully,
<p>
<B>BOZO SOLICITOR</B>

<H2>Exegesis</H2>
<br><br>
It is extremely important to consider this document in it's context.
Although I am very concerned about this court case to evict me next
week, I know that really they are unlikely to succeed and I expect
that they will pull out at the last moment so that the court case does
not happen. This is what has happened on 2 previous occasions and they
have not got a case against me. Even if it goes to court, I have got
another defence which I have not yet disclosed;
<P>
What first struck me about this document is the <B>absolute CRAP</B>
that is that first paragraph. It is total nonsense - they had a
reference and my name as drawer of the cheque, paid to my landlord. It
got me thinking - <B>Why are they writing this crap?</B>. The answer
is that they are deliberately trying to unsettle me. Then I noticed
that the last paragraph is also fairly hostile - "We <font
color=red>hereby require you ... </font> This is especially relevant
as I know that withholding rent to force the landlord to carry out
repairs is not a defence to not paying the rent - and even these crap
solicitors should know that. From there it was fairly easy - it's that
central paragraph that they are really after.
<P>
I can see that they are keen to trap me into admitting that I owe a
certain amount of rent (probably about £2,800) because otherwise they
probably have no chance of getting it from me.
<P>
There's more to this analysis. O.K. it's fairly clear that they are
from a different cultural background, but are they playing on that for
their own advantage? Of course they are. They are acting dumb, hoping
that I am racist, so that I consider them to be stupid as a racist
would and slip up and give them what they want. Prospective solicitors
would have to have a minimal standard of competence in English before
anyone would accept them for training (and I would expect that to
apply in India too). I am not at all impressed by this because it does
not show any originality or creativity - I think of it as their
habitual way of conducting themselves. 
<P>
There is more. They are also trying to catch me by using a command
from authority. The first paragraph is like a scolding from a child's
parents. They have had to search for something to be able to do this -
and what they found is far too poor. The last paragraph is similar but
also asserts authority over me - they are telling that I must conform
to their authority. I consider this very powerful as they are trying
to get me to perform a certain action. By performing that action I
would be submitting and accepting their authority. Then they would
have real power over me. There is also the danger that by replying to
that request, I would also slip-up and give them what they want.

I think you should also note the 'reasonable argumentation' tone: the 
wording between 
<font color=purple>You must
appreciate</fonT> and <font color=purple>we regret that we may not</fonT> 
acquires a sort of 'logical' might on its own.<br>
There's also a rhetorical figure known as epitrope, here (or <i>permissio</i>): 
the Author is trying to imply that the path chosen by the reader will not 
serve the 'real' interests of the reader himself, reversers should note 
that this is a typical form 
of the <i>simulatio</i>, where an Author always fakes complete innocence and 
neutrality of 
intentions in order to deceive his reader (getting him rhetorically 
off-balance). The whole piece is 
a classical example of <i>syntaxis obliqua</i> a grammatical scheme to hyde 
semanthically important snippets inside background syntaxis, as VK correctly 
states.
