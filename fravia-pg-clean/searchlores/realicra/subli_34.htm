<h1>
Subliminals in Cigarette Advertising</h1>

<b>by Behemoth</b> (January 2001)<bR>with a small addition by +Forseti<br>with a puzzled conclusion and some 
minor editing work by fravia+</center>
<br><i>Bullshit? Excessive paranoid reversing? I don't know. Could be, of course... but 
after having re-looked at the images 
a second time I wouldn't say so. Behemoth found A LOT of hidden images. +Forseti pointed out the skull. 
Someone really believes that all  this could be  
casual? From a mathematical point of view, the chances that these images 
are casual amount to 0.000000032.<br>
Hence it is worth pointing out 
that such a pavlovian reading is INDEED possible. And maybe even PROBABLE.<br>What for a 
beautiful society we live in... your ancestral libido harnessed to trick you into 
buying some fags.</i><br>

Subliminals in Cigarette Advertising</h1>

<b>by Behemoth</b><bR></center>
<br><img SRC="../images/subliminal2s.jpg" ALT="Click to enlarge" BORDER=0></a>
<p>Nice advertising, isn't it? This image campaign started in 1999
in Europe. I remember the day I saw it for the first time at a subway station.
"Strange", I thought. "A cigarette box in an ice cube?" Wandering about
this absurd composition I remembered of what I had learned about subliminal
techniques hidden inside advertisement crap. Ice cubes! There had been a famous story
about female bodies hidden in the structures of ice cubes... on purpose of course, 
in order to give men a
<u>concealed</u> sexual stimulus... pavlovnianly linked to the product.
<p>So I started rambling my look across this image. After a while I recognized
that my look was fixed again and again to some certain places in this advertisement,
but I have not been able to tell what was the glue that fixed my eyes.
<p>Playing this game again and again I have found a lot of hidden traps
now for optical associations. In this essay I will show you some of them.
There are a lot more! You will find them easily when you play the same
game with this advertising for yourself.
<br><i>Hint:</i> Do not try to analyze the structures systematically! You
will find more traps when you pause and look again at this image as if
you know nothing about it.

<td VALIGN=BOTTOM>Now, what the first shapes were I found myself? Let's
start at the upper left corner!&nbsp;
<p>Here you will find a figure that reminds of <b>an angel or a woman</b>.
Well that is nice. Though this seems not to be a very sexual symbol it
can get a more sexual content when you are a bit more stimulated by the
other anchors I will show you later. Once thinking or associating in sexual
contexts you might fantasize about a woman (or an angel ;-) ) that is <b>doing
something pleasant with her hands</b> to someone, maybe you?<br>Maybe you'll also notice the 
wide eyes and big mouth 'appeal' in the billboard...<br>Look!She's directly 
 staring <u>you</u> with her mouth wide open... <img SRC="../images/bigmouth.jpg" ALT="Click to enlarge" BORDER=0 height=47 width=68></a>

<td VALIGN=TOP>Directly under the caressing angel you will recognize a
pair of people, standing face to face. The left one (may be a woman?) is
putting her hand to the genital region of the right person. (Well, they
might be holding each others hand as well.) I have not done any editing
to this part of the image - so you may need some time of looking at this
scene before you recognize the shape of the arms, legs, the tight of the
woman and so on...
<br>Once you have this scene in your mind you should have a look again
at the original image. Then you will see the pair in the original scan
even better than in this cutted part. Please try this, it is worth investing
some time.
<br>&nbsp;

<tr>
<td VALIGN=TOP>Now we're rambling to the right side of the image. The biggest
shape that first fixed my look was this structure.&nbsp;
<br>For a long time I have not been able to tell, what exactly sucked my
eyes to this place. Then I found that the structure in the middle remembered
me to the center part of a nice slender <b>female body</b>. I saw the navel,
the middle line going up to the rips and a triangle of black pubic hair.
After that I found the whole length of legs down to the basis of the ice
cube. The upper parts of the body are not described distinctly. In the
version at the right I have made some attempts to mark arms and head where
I suppose them to be. In fact when you look a bit longer at this picture
you even will be able to recognize a very pretty female face!
<p>This has been very amusing so far, but in the next we will go to have
some anchors to oral sex and finally a couple having sexual intercourse!</td>

<br><i>"Supergirl" and moaning women</i></td>

<td VALIGN=TOP>Going to the right we will find another very interesting
Composition of sexual attributes. Look at the image on the left. This part
is located in the lower corner right next to the cigarette box.&nbsp;
<br>We find a female body that I have called "the Supergirl". The "<b>Supergirl</b>"
is directly feeding men's lolita fantasies. With a far to big head she
has the figure of a little girl, but her sexual attributes are those of
a super woman. We find a wide opened mouth, very large breasts and a very
small waist like a wasp. Her look is demonic. Is she yelling "Stick something
into my wide opened mouth"? Let's hope that all the painter had in mind,
was to stick a cigarette there!
<br>To the right we have a series of slightly distorted <b>female faces
with open mounds </b>that are superimposed by the edge structures of the
ice cube. But once you know about them you will find them easily in the
original scan.
<br>Look at the second version of this image now with slightly enhanced
contrast. The only editing I have done to the original piece is adding
the small black lines for the outlines of face and arm. I think the erotic
content is obvious.&nbsp;</td>

<br><i>The "Supergirl"</i>,&nbsp;
<br>enhanced contrast&nbsp;
<br>and lines added&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Having gone so far we might expect to finally find an image of <b>clear
sexual intercourse</b>, because that is what all the thoughts before are
pointing to. Now, where you would put this final signal in an advertising
campaign for a western customer?
<br>Well, the solution is easy: Looking at an image, a painting, a movie
scene is heavily influenced by our normal cultural use. In fact an European
or American man always will start looking at the upper left corner. Than,
finally, he will end at the lower right. So let's have a look at the lower
right!
<br>Damn. We cannot see much, because they have cut out the image to place
a nice slogan there. But look a while at the scene above to word "test"!
Yes, there is something, but it is not clear. No problem, there has been
an earlier version of this campaign where they had not cutted out this
part. I&nbsp; have a scan of this earlier version too. So here you can
see what they wanted to hide now: we find a picture of two peaople having
sexual intercourse!

<h3>
Summary</h3>
One of the Big Cigarette manufacturers has placed an advertising campaign
in 1999 that seems to work with subliminal&nbsp; messages. At the first
look all you can see is a cigarette box in an ice cube. While looking at
this your eyes are fixed to certain areas in the advertising above but
you are not able to say what is fixing your look. While starring at this
you then will receive a strong subliminal oral and sexual stimulus. You
are not able to control or censor this stimulus because it is not obvious
for mental recognition.
<br>So what else would you do than buying a cigarette right way or having
sex immediately? In most cases out on the streets you will decide to choose
the first alternative, rather than the second one.
<p>I have shown the upper advertising to some girl friends too. They did
not have the same effect, and even when I explained them the
secret patterns they were not so easily able to see it. So this advertising seems
to have been composed for targeting men with a load of subliminal messages.

<center><font size=+2>+Forseti's findings</font></center><hr width=44%>
Well hullo Fravia+,<br>
I have been looking for subliminals now for some years, and their
prescence in advertising has not diminished in the least from the days of
Wilson Bryan Key's famous book '<i>Subliminal Seduction</i>'. The use of
all-digital tools in advertising post-production makes inserting
subliminals into any image absurdly trivial, and the same subliminal can
be used repeatedly throughout an ad campaign, as well as by multiple
clients.<bR>
Here is a subliminal missed by Behemoth, though by no fault of his own,
you see he was looking for sexual images, and found some of them.<bR>
I have attached the image, but it is also online:

<hR><center><font size=+2>Fravia+ is puzzled</font></center><hr width=44%><i>
Now the big question... is a subliminal skull <u>in an advertisement for cigarettes</u> 
the proof that 
unconsciously people WANT to risk death when smoking? And the feminine bodies all around... why did the puppeteers choose 
such a symbolic cocktail?<br>
<bR>Feminine bodies and a skull (on the "shadow" side of the iceblock!)... why? Love and death have always been a winning recipe: 
Despite their irreconcilable discrepancy we all have to learn to live with, 
and deal with, love and death. Moreover, 
alongside with creative work and birth, love and death are after all the  
most remarkable events a man encounters in his life.

<br><bR>Now... what have we here? Eros versus Thanatos? Venus versus Ares? 
Is this a 'religious' subliminal advertisement, targeting young people with 
mystical needs?<bR> 
Maybe it is not necessary to wade into the mystics 
à la Francis de Sales ("Ah, come Holy Spirit! To love or to die! 
To die and to love!"). Brr...fanatics give me the creeps... 
 Indeed as anyone knows "love and death" are the very 
basement of all "christical" societies:  
they are so interconnected in the Passion 
that you cannot have the one without the other.<br> <br>
On the other hand, religions are just sovrastructures coded on more 
ancestral pushes, and in this advertisement the puppeteers are probably just playing with basic subconscious 
significances.<br>
<br>
The advertisement attraction of a (subliminal) image-cocktail of EROTIC LOVE and DEATH 
is probably so strong BECAUSE it's effects are compound.
<bR>
Psychiatric advice required... in the meantime take note 
that in his "Ego and the Id" Sigmund Freud described the essential 
bifurcation in the human psyche, and in "Beyond the Pleasure Principle", he 
theorized two primary drives for all living organisms: 
Eros (the Life Force), and Thanatos (the Death Instinct). 
<br>
According to Freud, Eros and Thanatos are 
locked in a struggle for the appropriation of crucial 
libidinal energies produced in the subconscious, the source of all 
life.
<br><br>
Seems unfair enough to me that in order to make some more money 
our libidinal energies are now used to harness 
our instincts in order to transform us into hapless consumers...
<bR><br>On the other hand: "You wanted a free-market society? Now lie in it"
