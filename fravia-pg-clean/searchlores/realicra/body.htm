Note the "patronising" tone, the false assumptions and the general "falsity" of the whole 
textes in this section, remember that these textes are "tutorials" for the annoying "salespersons", 
those awful bunch of commercial swines that try to sell you things you will probably NOT need.
These are the techniques they use, and some of the informations given here are worth to know! 
Read them and never 
fall again on these faul tricks (exspecially when used on TV ads).<br>
<br>
Some of these techniques can also be "reversed", which suits well my "reverse engineering" page:
if for instance</center>
<pre>
 8. Say, "How do you feel about that," not "What do you think about that."
     "Think" causes clients to think of objections. 
     "Feel" causes them to  think of reasons to buy.

you hear something like the stupid phrase above, you may want immediatly to use <u><b>reverse</b></u> body language and

 All of us are trained in the use of speech -- to communicate what
 we mean in a way that other people will understand. And most of the
 time, others understand what we mean. In a telephone conversation,
 we communicate through speech alone. In a face-to-face meeting,
 part of the communication is carried in a non-verbal form -- what is
 often called body language. 

 Why is body language so important? There are two principal
 reasons: 

      You have probably heard many times that people remember
      more of what they see than what they hear. Long after a
      meeting, we are likely to have forgotten the exact words
      someone used, but we may retain a vivid image of the same
      person's facial expression. 
      Through life experience we have learned, perhaps
      unconsciously, that people often lie with words. (We're talking
      here about the little white lies and omissions that are part of
      many conversations.) But facial expressions and other body
      language tend to be more honest. When a person's words and
      body language are consistent, we believe that person. When
      their words and body language say different things, we tend to
      believe the body language and doubt the words. 

 Picture this scenario: You say to a friend, "How was your review
 with the boss?" Your friend says. "OK" Then her smile vanishes, and
 her hand tightens around the notebook she is carrying. Did your
 friend really do OK in that review? Probably not, but she does not
 want to talk about her true feelings right now. When a person's facial
 expression differs from their words, your experience tells you to go
 with the visual cues not the words. 

 The Vocabulary Of Body Language 

 Body language, unlike spoken language, is inexact; so you have to be
 careful about how you interpret it. A certain movement or facial
 expression may be quite meaningful, or it may mean nothing at all. As
 a starting point, the lists below provide you with some common body
 language terms and their generally accepted meanings: 

 Positive body language
 Positive body language is generally quite reliable as an indicator of a
 person's feelings. It signals interest in the other person and in the
 conversation.

 Relaxed posture
 Comfortably seated, relaxed breathing, no visible stiffness or abrupt
 movements. These indicate no major barriers to communication.

 Arms relaxed 
 Uncrossed arms and hands open (palms up or otherwise visible to
 the other person) are signs of openness. 

 Good eye contact
 Looking in the other person's eyes, particularly when they are
 speaking, indicates interest in that person. Proper eye contact
 involves looking away occasionally to avoid staring.

 Nodding agreement 
 When nods are used to punctuate key things the other person has
 said, they signal agreement, interest and understanding. However,
 continual unconscious bobbing of the head usually indicates that the
 listener is tuning out.

 Taking notes 
 Shows interest and involvement, particularly if notes are on what the
 other person is saying.

 Smiling/adding humor 
 This is a very positive sign. It signals a warm personal relationship.

 Leaning closer
 Reducing the distance between two people, particularly when the
 other person is speaking. Indicates interest is up and barriers are
 down.

 Gesturing warmly
 Talking with hands, particularly with palms open, indicates
 involvement in the conversation and openness to the other person. 

 For all of these positive gestures, moderation is the rule. When they
 are exaggerated, they can become more negative than positive. 

 Negative Body Language 

 Negative body language is somewhat less reliable as an indicator of
 the person's comfort with the current conversation than positive body
 language. Actions that are generally considered negative may just be
 a matter of comfort for this person, may indicate that the person is
 tired or may result from other matters that are weighing on this
 person's mind.

 Body tense
 Stiffness, wrinkled brow, jerky body motion, hands clasped in front
 or palms down on the table. These can indicate concern with the
 topic or dealing with the other person.

 Arms folded in front
 Creates a barrier; can express resistance to what is being said.

 Hand on face
 A hand over one's mouth is a closed gesture. Leaning on one's elbow
 with the chin in the hand can communicate boredom. 

 Fidgeting
 Moving around a lot, playing with things and drumming fingers are
 usually a sign of boredom, nervousness or impatience.

 Arms behind head, leaning back
 In a well-established relationship, this can be a relaxed gesture. In a
 new relationship, it is often used to express a desire for control or
 power.

 Yawning 
 Boredom, confusion. The other person is talking too much or in too
 much technical detail.

 Impatience
 Trying to interrupt what the other person is saying; opening one's
 mouth frequently as if to speak.

 Distraction 
 Eyes flicking about, blank stares, flipping through literature without
 really reading it, looking at others in the office, looking at the person's
 body or clothing.

 Leaning away
 Avoiding moving closer, even when something is handed to the
 person, is strongly negative.

 Negative facial expressions 
 These include shaking head, eyes narrowed, scowling, frowning. 

 Combinations Count More Than Individual Gestures

 Body language is more meaningful when several expressions take
 place at the same time. For example, the combination of leaning
 forward, nodding and smiling is a strong indication of agreement and
 openness. Most meaningful is a matched set of gestures that also
 agrees with what the person is saying. 

 Transitions Count More Than Positions 

 As a rule of thumb, individual body positions or movements are
 frequently meaningless. Some people's faces form a smile or a frown
 more naturally than a neutral expression. Some people lean on their
 hand all the time; others never do it. Some people can't sit in a chair
 for more than a few minutes without crossing their arms; others sit
 erect with their hands at their sides. 

 What is meaningful, however, is a transition from one body position
 to another. If a person spends the entire meeting leaning forward,
 that may be just comfort. But if the same person starts out leaning
 back and then gradually moves forward as the meeting progresses,
 that's non-verbal communication. 

 Using Body Language Effectively 

 There are two ways you can use body language to enhance your
 face-to-face meetings: 

      Observe the customer's body language 
      Control your body language 

 Observing the customer's body language 
 From the moment you greet the customer, observe the customer's
 body language. At the beginning of the meeting, it is normal for
 customers to appear somewhat reserved or nervous. If this is a new
 relationship, the customer may not be ready to trust you yet. As the
 meeting progresses, the customer should normally warm up and
 begin to display more open body language. 

 Pay particular attention to any changes in the customer's body
 language, both positive and negative. Positive moves are buying
 signals -- you are on the right track and should keep going in the
 direction where you are headed. Negative moves are objections.
 They mean that you and the customer are beginning to diverge. Stop
 the track you are on, and get back in synch with the customer: 

      If the customer's body language is expressing discomfort or
      disagreement with what you are saying, you need to uncover
      the basis for the customer's discomfort and restore the positive
      track. 
      If the customer is dropping out of the conversation, it is time to
      stop talking and ask an open-ended question to get the
      customer involved again. The more the customer has drifted
      from the conversation, the more you must go back to the
      customer's goals and background -- something the customer
      knows a lot about and cares about.

<h3>Controlling Your Own Body Language  (Harnessing, Part 2)<br> </h3></center>
<br>
<hr size=2>
<pre>
 Controlling Your Own Body Language 

 One person's body language unconsciously influences how the other
 person in a meeting feels. So you can influence the way customers
 feel subtly through body language. 

 Speak a familiar language 
 Try to use non-verbal vocabulary that is generally understood to
 convey positive messages. If the customer is a good reader of body
 language, you are ahead. If the customer is not, you have not lost
 anything: 

      Maintain good posture, sitting erect but not stiff, hands visible
      and open.
      Avoid closed gestures such as crossing your arms across your
      chest. 
      Smile.
      Maintain eye contact, particularly while the customer is
      speaking. This says you care about what the customer is
      saying. To avoid staring, look away occasionally to take notes
      or to look at materials the customer has brought. 
      Focus your attention on the customer. Avoid fidgeting or
      letting your eyes wander while the customer is speaking.
      These actions will draw the customer's attention away from
      the conversation and suggest you would rather be somewhere
      else. 
      Nod agreement. This is positive if you do it convincingly and in
      appropriate places. If you do it automatically, it says you are
      not listening.
      Occasionally express agreement verbally to reinforce nods. 

 Reflect the customer's language 
 Make customers feel more comfortable at first by matching their
 body language. For example: 

      If the customer's body language is very open, begin to match
      it. 
      If it is reserved or nervous, tone down your enthusiasm a bit to
      make the customer more comfortable. 
      If the customer prefers to maintain some distance, avoid
      moving too closely. 
      If the customer moves slowly and makes few gestures, avoid
      extensive gesturing and quick movements. 

 Using Body Language To Influence The Way The
 Customer Feels 

 We normally think of body language as a reflection of what the
 person is feeling, and that's true. But it is also true that if you change
 your body language, your feelings will begin to change as well. That's
 why, when you feel yourself dragging in the middle of the afternoon,
 a quick walk around the block can rejuvenate you. You also tend to
 feel better when you put on fresh clothes or if you just smile. 

 This principle has two practical applications 
 You can make yourself look and feel better by using more positive
 body language. The famous football coach Vince Lombardi used to
 tell his players before an away game, "You've got to look good
 getting off the bus, and then play a heck of a game." In other words,
 if you look and act like a winner at the outset you are more likely to
 become one. 

 Body language is contagious. If person X uses relatively neutral body
 language, and person Y uses positive or negative body language,
 person X will gradually begin to mirror that. Thus, if the customer
 starts out neutral or somewhat negative and you are increasingly
 positive, the customer's body language (and thus their mood) will
 become more positive as well. 

 To influence the way the customer feels: 

   1.Start with body language that is generally considered to be
      positive. 
   2.Carefully observe the customer's body language.
   3.Alter your body language to more closely match the
      customer's. 
   4.During the meeting, if you think a more positive tone is
      desirable, gradually change your body language to be more
      positive in order to influence the way the customer feels.
      Always make positive transitions in your body language while
      the customer is speaking. This says you support the
      customer's ideas and feelings. If you make changes when you
      begin to speak, it may say that you are trying to take control. 

 Additional Body Language Techniques 

 Match your words and body language
 The customer will trust you less if you attempt to use body language
 that differs markedly from what you are saying. If you are honest in
 both, and use both to express your sincere interest in helping the
 customer, this will show. 

 Maintain the right distance 
 People have a comfort zone for how close they want other people to
 come; only people they feel very comfortable with are allowed to
 penetrate within a certain distance. Follow these guidelines to
 maintain a comfortable distance:

      Follow the customer's lead 
      From the moment you greet customers, watch where they
      stand. This will tell you how close to approach. If they back
      away a bit after the handshake, maintain a greater distance. 
   
      Don't tower over the customer 
      If you are much taller than the customer, be especially careful
      to keep a comfortable distance. Once you are seated and the
      customer communicates more openness, you can begin to
      approach more closely. 
      Be careful about touching 
      A firm, brief handshake is always acceptable for greeting
      someone you do not know well. Other touching is
      uncomfortable for many people. 
   
      Move closer together at an appropriate time 
      This is valuable in strengthening the positive relationship. But
      when you move closer to the customer, do it for a reason: 

           You can move closer to the customer to look at
           a document together, such as a brochure.
           If the customer begins to lean closer, expressing
           positive energy towards you, it is OK for you to
           lean closer as well.

Harnessing The Power Of Body Language: Part 1<br> </h3>

<br>
 Hypnotic techniques fall into three types: specific words used, actions
 or body language, and techniques that put you in control. 
<br><br>
 Words
<br><br>
 1. Talk in word pictures<br>
 When you get clients to vividly picture an experience, they are in an
 ideo-sensory trance. Use words that appeal to the senses of sight,
 sound, feeling, etc. 
<br><br>
      Car dealer: "Smell the new car."
<br><br>
      Realtor: "Imagine waking up and seeing the beautiful
      view from your bedroom window." 
<br><br>
 2. Use power or action words<br>
 "Grab it," "Let's run with it," or "Just do it," to motivate clients to
 action. 
<br><br>
 3. Take control with verbal commands 
<br><br>
      You need to buy today.<br>
      You must have one of these to be competitive.<br>
      You have to invest in this in order to have a secure future.<br>
      You need to live in this house.<br>
      Buy now! 
<br><br>
 4. Use hot, emotional words<br>
 Money, gain, new, you, loss, free, love, profit. 
<br><br>
 5. Use absolutes<br>
 Words like always and never show self-confidence and inspire
 trust. 
<br><br>
 Examples: 
<br><br>
 "It is always better to join a well-established health club." 
<br><br>
 "You will never regret making this decision." 
<br><br>
 6. Voice inflection<br>
 Emphasize positive words and commands to make clients focus on
 the positive benefits to them:<br>
 "You will love...."<br>
 "Buy now and save on the price." <br><br>

 7. Put spunk into your voice<br>
 Enthusiasm and energy sell. <br><br>

 8. Say, "How do you feel about that," not "What do you think
 about that."<br>
 "Think" causes clients to think of objections. "Feel" causes them to
 think of reasons to buy. <br><br>

 9. Start with higher price first<br>
 Then, when you show a lower-priced product or a bulk-buy, the
 price looks good relative to the first price stated. 
<br><br>
 10. Don't say the word "dollars"
 For example: $1,286. One thousand, two hundred eighty-six dollars
 sounds like a lot of money. Twelve eighty-six does not sound that
 expensive. 
<br><br>
 Actions Or Body Language
<br><br>
 1. Touch the client between the wrist and elbow occasionally<br>
 This eliminates barriers and creates a bond of trust. Remember,
 people buy from people they trust. 
<br><br>
 2. Use anchors to successfully close the sale<br>
 An anchor is a noise, gesture or touch that is given with a positive or
 flattering statement to the prospect. The anchor is repeated later in
 the presentation to associate these positive feelings with closing the
 sale. 
<br><br>
 3. Nod your head "yes"<br>
 As you're talking or listening, nod your head whenever anything
 positive is being said. This causes a feeling of positiveness to be
 associated with what you are selling. Also, as you nod your head,
 you will notice that the person you are talking to starts to move their
 head yes, too. The nodding of their head sends a subliminal message
 of agreement to their mind, which makes it easier for you to close the
 sale. 
<br><br>
 4. Mirror the client: <br>
<br><br>
      People trust people like themselves.<br>
      Mimic the body language of the client.<br>
      When you and the client are in synch, switch over and see if
      the client mimics you and your enthusiasm. <br><br>

 5. Smile naturally<br>
 It is proven that a smile fosters a positive reaction in a client. A client
 gets a good feeling from a smile and associates it with you and your
 product or service. People want to buy when they feel good. 
<br><br>
 6. Use facial expressions<br>
 Most charismatic people have rubbery faces. So, show emotions on
 your face to connect with the client's emotions. 
<br><br>
 7. Walk briskly and with confidence<br>
 This implies you know what you are doing and that you can be
 trusted. If you appear weak instead of confident, people will be
 afraid to take your advice. 
<br><br>
 8. Have a firm handshake<br>
 People don't respect wimps. They don't trust or buy form people
 they don't respect. 
<br><br>
 9. Don't wait to be seated -- take a seat<br>
 When two people meet, one person takes the dominant position and
 the other person takes the submissive. Here, dominant position
 doesn't refer to the aggressive position but rather the expert one. 
<br><br>
 10. Use open body language<br>
 Get excited when the client is interested. Relax if he starts to feel
 pressured. 
<br><br>
 11. Have good eye contact<br>
 People only trust people with good eye contact. 
<br><br>
 Techniques That Put You In Control
<br><br>
 Give the client post-hypnotic suggestions such as: 
<br><br>
      When you review this material after I leave, if any additional
      questions arise, I want you to pick up the phone and call me.
      Promise?<br>
      You will love the added security this insurance policy has built
      into it.<br>
      After you have been on the radio for a few months, you will
      notice that more people are responding to your newspaper
      ads.<br>
      Think how excited you will be when you are driving your new
      car. <br><br>

 2. Use "yes-yes" nail downs<br>
 It is important to get the client to say "yes" over and over because
 this sets up a condition of agreement that makes it easier to close the
 sale later. 
<br><br>
      "Do you want more profit?" -- "Yes."<br>
      "Do you need more money?" -- "Yes."<br>
      "It's a beautiful day, isn't it?" -- "Yes." <br><br>

 3. Find out their style of buying and adapt your presentation
 accordingly<br>
 "How did you decide which house to buy when you bought last
 time?" <br><br>

 When the client answers this question, he is telling you how to sell
 him (with facts, emotion, ego, etc.). 

<br><br>                      
 4. Show empathy by repeating the client's statements, even if
 you disagree 
<br><br>
 Client: Your product doesn't work. 
<br><br>
 Salesperson: You feel my product doesn't work. 
<br><br>
 5. Move into the future and show a need<br>
 "As your family grows, you'll need the extra space this house has to
 offer." 
<br><br>
 6. Use "just suppose" to get around objections <br><br>

 Client: I'm not ready to buy. 
<br><br>
 Salesperson: Just suppose you were, what changed your mind? 
<br><br>
      Now the client has just told you how to sell him. 
<br><br>
 7. Take control by asking strong questions such as:<br>
 "What would it take to get you to buy today?" Or, "What is the main
 concern you have left?" "Is there something you haven't told me?" 
<br><br>
 8. Make it fun<br>
 People hate to be sold, although they love to buy, and they buy from
 people they like. Don't bore them. Talk to them as you would talk to
 a friend at a party. This makes them want to see you and buy from
 you. 
<br><br>
 9. Memorize answers to recurring objections<br>
 Top salespeople know what to say to 99% of all objections. Since
 clients have learned ways to put you off, it makes sense that you
 learn ways to counter their efforts. In order to stay in control, you
 have to be able to effortlessly get around whatever stumbling block
 the client brings up and continue selling until they buy. 
<br><br>
 10. Repeat the client's hot button several times<br>
 A famous saying in advertising is, "Nothing sells like repetition."
 When a message is repeated over and over, it embeds itself in the
 client's mind. We must hear something over and over before we act
 on it. When you give a benefit that the client responds positively to,
 repeat it often throughout your presentation. Each time you repeat it,
 the client becomes more and more receptive to buying, so that when
 you close, buying has become the right thing to do. 
<br><br>
 11. Use an assumptive attitude<br>
 Speak as if the client has already bought. 
<br><br>
 "When you buy this big screen television...." instead of, "If you buy
 this big screen television...." 
<br><br>
 These hypnotic techniques can be learned by anyone. Practice them
 until they are a natural part of your presentation and become
 undetectable by the client. Hypnotic selling will close more sales and
 make you more money with less work
