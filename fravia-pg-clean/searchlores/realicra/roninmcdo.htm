 <i>About time somebody would begin gathering useful pointers... it is well known 
 that eating at McDonald is tantamount to 'reverse shitting', and now any reader and seeker 
 will be able to see why... there is even an 'antivomitory' section at the bottom of rõnin's contribution, yurk!<br>
 As you'll soon realize, some of the hints given by both Authors (especially telmor) are 
 not easy to follow. But searching power and knowledge awaits reality crackers that will delve into these 
 small essays...<br><br>

 First strike on McDonald<br>
A look into marketing propaganda<br>

<br>
 First strike on McDonald</b>&nbsp;<br>
 okay, after that first failure, another try :)
<br>
<br>Who hate McDonald, and claim it on the web ?
<br><a href="http://www.mcspotlight.org">Mc Spotlight</a>
<br><i>The biggest, loudest, most red, most 
<br>read Anti-McDonald's extravaganza the world has ever seen. Anything 
<br>you could possibly want to know about McDonald's or McLibel nestles 
<br>somewhere in our 21,000 files. Don't get us wrong, though, we're not
<br> telling you to give up your Big Macs. We just provide the info for you to judge for yourself.</i>
<br>
<br>120Mo of information :)
<br>A SE for our purpose : <a href="http://www.mcspotlight.org/cgi-bin/swish-bin/Swish-Search.cgi">http://www.mcspotlight.org/cgi-bin/swish-bin/Swish-Search.cgi</a>
<br>
<br>~
<br>
<br>Okay, now, this is a first strike :
<br>
<br>http://www.mcspotlight.org/company/publications/mcfact.html
<br><i>McDonald's official book of information about themselves, "provides a detailed insight into every aspect of the company"</i>
<br>
<br>This is old stuff, maybe we can find a newer one. Anyway it'd be a great start for McDonald Hunters
<br>
<br>http://www.mcspotlight.org/company/publications/nutrition_info.html
<br><i>Lists every ingredient in every menu item - includes E-numbers, plus the revised table of nutrition analysis.
<br>Revised <b>June 1995</b>
<br>
<br>WARNING - the information on this page is company propaganda, produced to persuade you to buy more of McDonald's products. Parts of it may be deliberately misleading.</i>
<br>
<br>Hehehe :)
<br>So, this is propaganda ? "produced to persuade you to buy more of McDonald's products" ?
<br>
<br>Let's use the Maxine+ essays on the Dangerous Food Additives (<a href="http://www.searchlores.org/realicra/danadd1.htm">1</a> and <a href="http://www.searchlores.org/realicra/danadd2.htm">2</a>)
<br>
<br>Found in the list :
<br>
<br><b>E110 Sunset Yellow</b> IN Strawberry milkshake (again, the <a href="http://www.searchlores.org/realicra/strawber.htm">strawberry field</a> ;)
<br>- a synthetic colourant, which can provoke allergic reactions and hyperactivity; and increased incidence of tumours in animals; banned in Norway.                                                   
<br>
<br><b>E123 Amaranth </b>IN Strawberry and chocolate milkshakes
<br>- a synthetic colourant, which can provoke asthma, eczema and hyperactivity; it caused birth defects and foetal deaths in some animal tests, possibly also cancer; banned in the USA, Russia and at least 5 other countries.                                                   
<br>
<br><b>E250 Sodium Nitrite</b> IN Canadian style bacon, pizza pepperoni, Julienne ham slices.
<br>- preservatives and colour fixatives, which may provoke hyperactivity and other adverse reactions; potentially carcinogenic; their use is severely restricted in many countries. Nitrates and nitrites are preservatives that also add colour and flavour, and are common in preserved meats such as salami.                                                        
<br>
<br><b>E407 Carrageenan</b> IN Birthday cake, all milkshakes. (happy birthday kids)
<br> - stabiliser and thickening agent; linked to toxic hazards, including ulcers and cancer; the most serious concerns relate to degraded carrageenan, which is not a permitted additive. However, native carrageenan, which is used, may become degraded in the gut.                                                                                     
<br>
<br><b>E420 Sorbitol </b> IN Birthday cake
<br>Polyols being used in foods in the U.S. are erythritol, hydrogenated starch hydrolysates (including maltitol syrups), 
<br>isomalt, lactitol, maltitol, mannitol, sorbitol and xylitol. (look them up http://www.caloriecontrol.org/redcal.html).
<br>For the vast majority of consumers, polyols do not cause any problem. In some people, excessive consumption may cause 
<br>gastrointestinal symptoms, including laxative effects, similar to reactions to beans and certain high-fiber foods. 
<br>Such symptoms are dependent upon an individual’s sensitivity and the other foods eaten along with the polyol-containing 
<br>product.
<br>
<br>Do not forget that it was written in 1995 ... maybe they have changed .......
<br>
<br>~
<br>
<br>For the anti-vomitory hunt, there are some path :
<br>
<br>http://www.magdalin.com/herbal/plants_pages/m/mint_pepper.htm
<br><i>Modern uses: The plant yields Peppermint Oil, which contains menthol. It is anti-spasmodic, relieving pains in the alimentary canal. The dosage is one to three drops on sugar. Mint removes nausea and flatulence and allays vorniting.</i>
<br>
<br>Some medecines used for prevention of vomiting :
<br>http://agmed.sante.gouv.fr/htm/5/zophren.htm
<br>http://agmed.sante.gouv.fr/htm/5/navoban.htm
<br>http://agmed.sante.gouv.fr/htm/5/anzemet.htm
<br>
<br>I need to collect the molecules used in these one, and cross that with the nutrition info page. 
<br>The odonsetron seems to be sell for not-pharma use (louder signal ?)
<br>
<br>http://www.kesslerchemical.com/index.htm
<br><i>Kessler Chemical is a respected supplier of specialty, organic intermediates,and solvents, with a commitment to value-added service. This means that Kessler Chemical emphasizes the "custom" in customer service, by finding ways to go beyond simply delivering chemicals to you.</i>
<br>
<br>I'm not hoping too much to find that info on the web (see gs post) ...
<br>I'll ask to some employees too ;)

<br>So, we're out for a hunt ? What's the beast ? 
<br>Ronald ... ermm
<br>
<br>That's a huge corp. Not an easy prey. 
<br>The advise from gs is more than true :
<br>"You were not really expecting that our enemies would put their stuff online - and even wit the same words, did you ?"
<br>
<br>We need to find WHO they are, WHERE they live, HOW they communicate (how they reproduce ? :p).

<br>                         *******
<br>                         
<br>Tremor : Hi Jon Parlow. Tell me who you are
<br>Parlow : it's a pleasure for me to spend this time with you. We haven't had an opportunity to spend much one on one time together.
<br>I started my career with McDonald's as a Regional Controller. I have an accountanting degree/CPA. After doing the controller job for 
<br>about 5 years I was approached with the idea of moving over to the operations side of McDonald's.
<br>
<br>Tremor : So, you have some knowledge concerning your herd ?
<br>Parlow: I started out my operation adventure a manager trainee. I progress through all of the manager positions up 
<br>to restaurant manager in 1 year. Then I was promoted to Operations Consultant overseeing 5 McOpcoowned restaurants. 
<br>I progress to a Business Consultant in about 18 months. In that position I was responsible for consultanting with 
<br>owner/ operator restaurant McDonald's. After another 18 months or so I moved into a department head position "Operations
<br>Manager". I was responsible for 20 McOpco operated McDonald's. I did that job for 3 years. Today I'm the Michigan Regions
<br>Franchising Manager.
<br>
<br>Tremor : how great ... so, tell me what kind of technology you use.
<br>Parlow: I definitely was into the ISP processors in the restaurants. I was amazed about all the store data that could be retrieved from
<br>the ISP. The Restaurant ISP is a restaurant computer system for reviewing and receiving restaurant data. The ISP is one of 
<br>the important tools in maximizing restaurant performance in all areas (sales, profits, people, etc.)
<br><i>
<br>Restaurant data includes:
<br>
<br>1. Sales results (Hourly, Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Day part (breakfast, Lunch or evening), and etc.
<br>2. Product Mix report tells management what is selling and unit movement.
<br>3. Service Time information
<br>
<br>Stores data:
<br>
<br>1. Personnel Information
<br>2. Inventory Management
<br>3. Employee development Data
<br>
<br>Communications:
<br>
<br>1. Managers communicate with open another through messenger system.
<br>2. Corporate communication to restaurants.
<br>3. Food orders are created and transmitted to food distribution center.</i>
<br>
<br>Tremor : you must be good in data processing &#33;
<br>Parlow : Oh no &#33; I suck &#33; I didn’t take any in-depth computer classes in college. I picked up my computer skills 
<br>from pecking around. I learned some basic Word Perfect and lotus back then for different class assignments in
<br>college. Throughout my working career I've picked up some additional skills like Word, Excel, Power Point and 
<br>lotus notes. Whenever I get the time I would like to enhance my computer knowledge. I have also thought about going 
<br>back to school for a MBA.
<br>
<br>Tremor : i see ... and for the 'networking' part ? how does it work ?
<br>Parlow : I have remote access to get into McDonald's network when I'm on the road or at home. My Nextel
<br>phone gets a lot of minutes. A lot of my communications are given and received through the voice mail system. 
<br>I do utilize email for communications also. The Email system is excellent when I have forms to forward or 
<br>receiving documents. The McDonald's Intranet ARCHIE gets a lot of attention from me too. The Intranet provides 
<br>me with updated information on potential candidates looking to buy restaurants, updated information on licensing
<br>requirements and much more.
<br>
<br>Tremor : Archie. I think i've got all i needed from you.
<br>Parlow : Please, lemme go &#33;
<br>
<br>Tremor : I don't eat old sicked prey. leave &#33;
<br>
<br>                         *******
<br>                         
<br>Seems we are on a good track. We've learn some valuable information &#33;
<br>So, they have an intranet. Let's see if we can find other tips with the foreigner that collaborate with them
