</center>
<br><center><i>
Reality cracking is a very important 'critical' activity, 
as Curious George wrote to me:</i></center>
<br>
<prE>More than that, "Reality Cracking" can be accomplished 
by anyone with a critical mind.  You don't need hours 
of undisturbed time in front of the computer. You can 
practice your reality cracking skills all day long, 
everyday of your life! And you should, lest you be taken 
advantage of unknowingly.</prE><br><i>Yessir! That's one of the 
main points, and the satisfaction you'll gain every time you arrive to 
see 'through' a concealed message (which is always soo obvious AFTERWARD) 
is a really great feeling.<p>You may ask why so many essays of the reality 
cracking section are directed against advertisement and our 'consumistic' habits. 
Simply stated, there's a lot of money being made and a lot of power being gathered 
by the people that promote useless consumerism, and this determines a GREAT 
part of the reality you live in. You pay for it in gradually limited 
economic mobility, pollution, threats to your health and a declining 
standard of living, as measured by the things that really matter. This is what 
this section is about, identifying these forces and giving you opportunities 
to lessen or eliminate their control over your life. We're not suggesting that 
you pick up guns and start blasting away. What we advocate does far more 
damage than bullets to these forces and the people behind them and 
makes life much more enjoyable for you while it returns to you -at least in part- the 
possibility of living the way that you -not somebody else- choose.
<br></center><Font size=+4><font color=gray>
Dear contributors,</fonT></fonT><br>please don't be deceived if the essay you 
sent was not published, see:  Reality cracking is a matter of observation 
and knowledge, balance and wit, it's very important to avoid
taking ourselves too seriously... a common disease. 
Watch, work, send your findings... and avoid the ever lurking
 risks to fall into the 'weird-religious-nutty' or into the
'ideologically excessive-obsessed' patterns. Best essays are those that examine 
a CONCRETE aspect of the reality around you and show it's hidden meaning: see, it is 
obvious (if silly) that half-naked babes on -say- new cars help selling those same 
said cars to the zombies... but it is <u>not</u> so 
obvious, for instance, that yougurts or fruit 
juices made with only ONE sort of fruit are all over the world slowly being 
replaced by yogurts and fruit juices made with a 'cocktail' of fruit <u>rests</u> 
("tropical mix", "apples AND bananas", "fruits of the wald") for the purpose of 
maximising gains... consumer "choices" are only a nuisance once you have already 
lurked the same  
consumers into buying your products or using your supermarket chain...<br> 
What do you think that 'modes' and 'trends' have 
been <u>made</u> for? ... or d'you think you can buy somewhere  
a new fridge (say) that has been built solid enough to last for the next 
thirty years?</i></center>

 STEAL THIS BOOK! A reality cracking Handbook.<br>
 <i> But again, the dictionary of law fails us. Murder in a uniform is heroic, in a costume it 
 is a crime. False advertisements win awards, forgers end up in jail. Inflated prices guarantee large 
 profits while shoplifters are punished. Politicians conspire to create police riots and the victims are 
 convicted in the courts. Students are gunned down and then indicted by suburban grand juries as the 
 trouble-makers. A modern, highly mechanized army travels 9,000 miles to commit genocide against a small 
 nation of great vision and then accuses its people of aggression. Slumlords allow rats to maim children 
 and then complain of violence in the streets. Everything is topsy-turvy.</i><br>by <u>Abbie Hoffman</u>,  September 2004<br>

by the overbearing stench of crotch sweat and hair wax.

 Economist</A><font color=blue>]</font> WEEKLY for those of you who can
read only
English (Karl Marx was an avid reader of the Economist :-) there
is of course MORE disinformation than information, but the former 
is -at least- VERY cleverly presented. Must read (and reverse) for all those interested in 
"high level" propaganda (where some snippets of true information are 
continuously presented below the dull iceberg of skilled Guinea-Pig conditioning).<p>

Keeping the
Rabble in Line by Noam Chomsky,
interviewed by David Barsamian, is for instance a
very cool and precise analyse of the world
affairs (unfortunately heavily unbalanced in middle 
east matters imo, for the rest quite 
correct)<br>
You'll find a small
part of Chomsky's cutting
interpretations  <font color=blue>[</font><a target=_top href="http://www.zmag.org/zmag/authorlist.cfm?lname=Chomsky">here</a><font color=blue>]</font>.
Read
 these pages as soon as you can, you'll not regret it!<br>
I'm not Chomskian myself (far from it), but his views
and mine do actually converge on so many points that I'm glad he
exists and teaches</i> :-)</center>

newspaper you need, but don't hold your breath for truths... being able to read any newspapers 
of the planet does not mean much if you don't know how 
to filter out the very rare snippets of information and to recognize the few valuable sources of information that 
are not simple progandistic megaphones of their owners' interests. This said it is for sure quite instructive 
to learn that slightly different soups of commercial advertisement, 
hysterical nationalism & ridicolous propaganda are served - under all latitudes - 
to the zombies...
