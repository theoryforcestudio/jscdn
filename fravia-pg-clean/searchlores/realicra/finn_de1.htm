   <i>A great, simple essay, that recalls 
what <a href="finn_de1.htm#svdago">Svd wrote</a> some years ago. I enjoyed it a lot. And it drove me to immediate action! 
I began putting some adhesive white labels on the creepy 
Packard Bell and Hewlett Packard logos that sat in front of me since many years, 
staring at me with their evil grin. Hey! I could not stop. I went in the kitchen and 
debranded more and more. It may be just a silly, infinitesimale crumb, but 
I feel already better</i> :-)

<P>It all began as some fun. We had just purchased a microwave oven, unpacked it
and found a suitable place in our kitchen for it to sit.</P>

<P>A little oven, shiny and white, with the brand name emblazoned on the front
in fancy blue writing.  The brand was one of those names like a person might
have; John or Harold or Marc or Willem, or Philippe.

<P>I was tidying up when my wife came into the room and stuck some adhesive
tape over the brand name. On the tape she had written in colourful letters
"BOB".  We had just de-branded our first household item.

<P>Having a distaste for intrusive advertising and marketing, this de-branding
appealed to me.  Most Reality Crackers have read the now famous 
<A HREF="http://www.searchlores.org/realicra/slaves.htm">Supermarket</A>
essay by +ORC.  Like many others I must pay homage to this essay for inspiring
me to really think about the calculated way in which the world around us is 
constructed.  It may appear haphazard, but often it is not.

<P>Nobody asks for email spam in their inbox.  Why should you accept spam in your
house?  

<P>Have a look around your space.  How many items do you see with a brand
name smeared across it?  Can you see any that have none?  Maybe some furniture.
Maybe some old or antique items but most modern electrical items will have 
<A HREF="http://www.writersblock.ca/winter01/a-featur.htm">advertising</A> 
staring out at you.  Constantly refreshing your conscious and 
sub-conscious.  Whether you stare directly at it, or a cursory glance, or 
merely it is in your peripheral vision and you don't even think that it is 
there, it is re-enforcing your recognition and familiarity with that word or
<A HREF="http://www.mcspotlight.org/media/press/mcds/theguardian230900.html">logo</A>.
It is junk mail of the mind!

<P>It is a type of invasion.  An infiltration into our homes and into our already
bombarded attention spans.  It is littering what the people at Adbusters call 
the '<A HREF="http://adbusters.org/magazine/38/mentalenvironment/">mental environment</A>'; 
our minds.  And at the end of the day when you 
return home, back to your sanctuary, away from the billboards, and neon and 
piped music, there too, the advertising exists.  In more subtle ways, but it's
there.  It has crept in.  Hitched a ride straight into your home and you 
probably paid no attention to it at all.  And perhaps it's subtlety makes it
more persuasive, more effective.  You might find it more acceptable.  
<A HREF="http://www.searchlores.org/realicra/conself2.htm">Succumb</A>
to it more easily.

<P>Now I'm not pretending that de-branding your environment is going to fix all
your troubles.  You may have no problem with living in a commercial, messages
jumping out at you from every direction.  Some people 
<A HREF="http://www.ozfactors.com/PICTURES/PSYCHS/Insane%20Asylum%20Patient%20in%20a%20Straitjacket.jpg">don't</A>.  
But if you are 
like me you may get a small pleasure from reversing these worms.  It's a 
personal act of defiance and minor rebellion.  Pushing back the invasion.

<P>It's also a good topic of conversation when visitors come over.  A good 
opportunity to tell them about Reality Cracking.  A good test maybe, see if
they come back once they find out you are socially unconventional!! ;)

<P>We have found adhesive electrical tape is quite good for covering up brand 
names.  It comes in a variety of colours and I use white on our kitchen
appliances and black on the TV, VCR, HiFi, etc.  For the most part you can't
even notice it.  It's quite un-obtrusive.

<P>Of course you can also have a bit of fun and make some new names for your 
items.  Using coloured markers to write on masking tape might be more your 
style.

<P>We have a chrome/steel coloured refrigerator and I haven't really found a 
suitable tape for this.  Let me know if you have any ideas.  

<P>Computer beige is another one which can be tricky.  I use black tape on my 
monitor, it's more obvious but I have cut it into a small shape so it is 
slightly artistic.  Better than 'Hitachi CM772' don't you think?

<P>You can be as creative as you like.  Spend as much or as little time as you 
want.  It's the personal satisfaction that you will get when you walk into 
your room and glance at the TV called 'Tony' that will make it worth your 
while.  You will get a little smile and feel good about the power you have 
over your environment.  You are in control to reverse the items that make up
your personal landscape.

<P>I'd like to finish on a slightly different topic.  A story I found about one
person's personal rebellion.  I wish I could remember where on the web I found
this so I can properly credit the author but unfortunately my memory fails me.
I'll relay the idea to you anyway.  

<P>This person wanted to protest against those who are constantly zapping their 
messages at us.  His idea was to write a message back.  A counter message that
others could read.  He wrote his short message on money and when he spent this 
money his protest was released.

<P>Nobody would destroy his message.  Who would destroy money?  And think how far
this rebellious act would travel?  Further than a billboard on a bus.  
How many people would read it?  How long would it circulate for?

<P>In some places this is a federal offence.  A criminal act.  And this small 
crime made him feel like he was fighting back in some small way.

<P>I don't believe it's always best to fight fire with fire.  We need to be 
careful not to become the thing that we despise.  But it is an interesting
story none-the-less.

<P>(c) Finn61, 2002

<P>PS. It's about freedom in neural networks.  </p>

            a Reality Cracking Technique
Decreasing the level of "visionary" noise around you
 - remove the ad's at least there, where you are on the rudder...
<P>
This essay may look to you rather dirty... but think again.
     <P>
When you enter your toilet, and stand to piss there, what do you
see? a calendar on the wall? a lovely view through the window?
naah... Usualy you see the label of the manufacturer of the urinal
or the toilet bowl. And you see and read that ten times every
day... 3650 times per year..
                           <P>
if i'm awaken at midnight and asked what's 5 times 5, or what's
the name of my cousin, may be i'll think a little, but if i'm
asked who's the manufacturer of the toilet bowl and plastics
there, i'll name it IMMEDIATELY! (KDN, i.e. Kombinat Domakinski
N-something, it was in BG; now the new one is CAROMA)
                                                   <P>
When you go to brush your teeth (well, i hope you don't do it very
frequently, and hope with very-small amount of toothpaste - they
both destroy your teeth), or wash your hands, or dishes or
whatever, what do you see? The label of the manifactuer of the
sink... assume 5-6 times per day...  1800 times per year..

   <P>
When your take a shower, are all the shampoos and soaps etc around
there on some shell? Let's make an exercise. Can you now remember
what is written there?      <br>
(well, i remember this: it's pink, some picture of woman's hair,
and the words "selected" "helena" "No1" "cusshions" "active"
"repeat the ... and then rinse thoroughly"... "gillette")
Now go and check how many of them come from one thing...  and
where the rest come from.. In my case the 1st three are from my
shampoo (i hate shampoos too:(, they make my hair worse day-by-day
- as any detergent), 'cusshions' is from some soap that i NEVER
use (where the hell it came from?) and "active" and the rest
sentence is from another shampoo (not mine)... and "gillette" is
the label of some razor that sits there since inmemorial ages...
           <P>
once/twice per day x 10-15 words ... 3650-10000 words per year...
Now i remember that every time, while i take a shower, i am
Reading unconsouisly All the printed text on that shampoos...
                <P>
Your car? how many labels of some SUPER SPECIAL SYSTEMs are there?
Your video? Audio systems (e.g. digital extra analogous loopback
super, i.e. DEALS?) ? Washing mashine? Computer? how many times
per day you read that EPSON LQ-500 that stays on your desk?
DTK-computer? 233MHz stupid display (instead of putting something
useful, like a cheap digital clock, they put this lustrous
shit...)      <P>
?
How many times you have read that Headline of that old newspaper
lying on the cabinet? And howmany times you tried NOT to look at
the ad's that are there?
?               <P>
How many labels and ads are on your walls? well, i'm sure you did
not put them there intentionaly, they came like 'extra' WITH
something else - calendars, or paintings, or book shelf,
whatever...
            <P>
THE EYES of any human has extremely high bandwidth and about 120'
degree visibility angle, but that is noncontrollable. Controllable
angle is only around 35-45 degrees. All the rest is received,
accepted, processed, and most of it REMEMBERED by the
subconsiousness. Regardless if you want that or not.
                       <P>
Just sit down in your most famous chair/sofa and look around...
and count. Hundreds of useless nagging labels... in YOUR home...
they came withour asking you... they enetr your head without
asking you... thousands and thousands times...
I name this brainwashing. IN YOUR OWN HOME? By yourself?
                   <P>
Every label, every picture, every sign you pass by, or your look
pass by, is processed. Not all of it is remembered, of course, but
the most contrast/differring things are. Now look how many of the
labels you have around are NOT loud and flashy... 1% or even less?
                               <P>
And all this bullshit is poured over your poor subconsiousness
Every day... Yes, the conscious part of the mind trys its best to
ignore it... but it is not omnipotent. And, then you may have
headache. Or enter some shop and buy something WITHOUT any
consious intention to do it... but realize that only some time
LATER...

 <P>
Do you catch my idea? We can't escape (easily) from the nagging
billboards, newspapers, flashy webpages, etc... But WE CAN chase
out the bastards from our own home - it is OUR fortress!
             <P>
Some shampoos and other things has their labels simply
glued/sticked - remove them! Others look painted but are not -
they are printed on transparent film and that film is sticked over
the packing... Remove it!  <br>
Some nagging labels are just piece of plastic, glued to the
computer/player/wheel/... Remove it! <br>
Well, some labels are REALLY nasty. But they are even easier.
Ha-hA. Take a single-colored (!) sticky tape, with a nearest
possible color to te background color around the label you are
going to eliminate, and PATCH IT! one patch - 3000 readings/labels
per year/month/day less... of course, make it look GOOD and smooth
- or your eyes will always focus immediately at it...  <br>
Or take some paint or some nail-polish and SPREAD IT OVER...  <br>
again, try to make the whole label INVISIBLE in terms of the
surrounding background.     <br>
after reading a newspaper/magazine, Hide it! into some not easy
visible place! or cover it with some sheet of paper...
                  <P>
Okay, i do not pretend i have destroyed all the labels around me -
some of them simply look fine, and even beautiful, and i let them
live... But the rest shall die... sooner or later. Yes, i'm
writing this, i know it should be this way, but even i myself
can't escape from the habbit... of being NOT PAID for reading
advertisements...and NOT to complain for that. They
(enslave)teached us to do that for free...
           <P>
---    <br>

       <P>
Example: some time ago, i entered some shop for some kind of
furniture, and almost choosed one piece, when i say some ugly
nagging label attached to it. I said to the sellperson - "i'll buy
it, if you remove this sign (well, i almost said 'crap' then;)
from here". He said - well, we should consult with the
manufacturer, we'll call you back. And, after couple of days, he
call me and said: okay, you could take that Without the label, and
it will cost you ... (which was 5% more).  <br>
?         <br>
(!)        <br>
?               <br>
you did not believe that?    <br>
your problem. some sunny day you'll get that experience yourself.
Just try to not to play by thier rules...
      <br>

svd      <br> <br>
P.S. Please don't take all this literally. Removing the labels
from some pills or other medicals IS DANGEROUS. Please, ...simply
THINK.
