<i>Well, I felt necessary to add this small 'marvel' to our reality cracking section, it's a 
extremely intelligent reality cracking essay (or rather 'reality cracking tool' :-) that you 
could find until some time ago, in its original version, at 
<a href="http://www.adbusters.org">http://www.adbusters.org</a>. 
Yet the subject is so fascinating that I decided to host my local copy of it (with images!) on 
my own site! Yes, liberate billboards (keep in mind that we are not paid -far from it- 
for being compelled to slurp all the visual garbage they throw at us everywhere!) Enjoy this 
essay and have fun! :-)

With a little ingenuity, some hammering and sawing in the workshop, 
and a free evening or two, it isn't difficult to liberate a billboard. 
Watch the image (right) to find out how to make your own Billboard Buster -- 
perfect for putting the blemish of truth on those impossibly perfect complexions.

Here are a few ideas for your first liberations:
</P>

<UL TYPE="DISC">
	<LI><B>Case of acne:</B> Retouchers remove the blemishes on model's faces in order to create billboard people. The BB MK 1 and the Oil Stick Detoucher seemed ideal for reintroducing the blemishes. By adding acne spots we could turn billboard person who flogs products into real person who couldn't sell a thing.
<br><br>

	<LI><B>Zombie eyes:</B> Simply restoring people to normality seemed rather tame, so we came up with some other ideas. Two quick bursts of white aimed at the center of the eyes would turn a billboard person into a zombie from Children of the Damned or Night of the Living Dead.

<P>
<UL TYPE="DISC">
	<LI><B>Trickle of blood:</B> A blast of dark red spray paint aimed at the corner of the mouth and allowed to run would make a billboard person look really sick. It would suggest an unfashionable trauma, a distasteful disease, or a nasty bite.
<br><bR>
	<LI><B>Hitlerizing:</B> Adding a quick Hitler mustache could easily undo the advertising image of an actual person, such as a politician. Because it would suggest the person held fascist views, we thought we should save it for those who belong to the far right.
