                    Plagiarism is your friend. Use it.</li>

                    Whenever contradicted; morph, start calling people names, and make false accusations. Include the children of your target in your allegations, even if they don't have any. </li>

                    Scare your enemies with lawsuits, police escorts and whines. </li>
                                <li>
                    Always back up your empty (albeit noisy) threats with phony LARTs(<a href="way_kook.htm#note1">1</a>),
                      false police reports, and harassing letters to the FBI and other

                                <li>
                    Be vigilant in your redundancy. The more you repeat yourself, the more
                    likely others will believe you!</li>
                                <li>
                    If you can't find anyone as crazy as yourself to support you in the
                      flamewars you start with the normal population, create sock puppets
                      and use anonymous remailers that shamelessly hang on every word you
                      write.</li>
                                <li>The more your fake personalities adulate you, the more respect you'll
                  get!</li>

                                <li>Incoherency is not a roadblock to poasting(<a href="way_kook.htm#note2">2</a>).</li>
                                <li>Neither is illiteracy. </li>
                                <li>Delusions poasted often enough become fact.</li>

                                <li>Always accuse others of the very acts you are guilty of.</li>
                                <li>Post lots of boasts about your high IQ and incredible talents.</li>
                                <li>Always &lt;plonk&gt;(<a href="way_kook.htm#note8">8</a>) somebody just before replying the plonkee!</li>
                                <li>Write a self-published book and claim it a success. Bonus points for comparing it to &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; and/or the Bible.</li>

                                <li>Frothing complaints carry far more weight when you send them from &quot;legal@&quot; some domain.</li>
                                <li>Nothing strikes terror into the hearts of your detractors more than
                    telling them that you're archiving their messages for possible use in
                    the future.</li>
                                <li>Never forget that everyone else posting to Usenet is a paid
                  disinformation agent looking to discredit you.</li>
                                <li>Usenet is governed by US law. If a poster in Romania killfiles you,
                  he's obviously violating your 1st Amendment rights and can be sued.</li>
                                <li>Every news admin in the world hangs out in NANAU(<a href="way_kook.htm#note9">9</a>), and they're just
                  dying to nuke the account of that meanyhead who just called you &quot;fucknozzle&quot;. Drop 'em a line - that's what they're there for, after all.</li>
                                <li>AUK(<a href="way_kook.htm#note10">10</a>) <em>will</em> be closed down. Just you wait and see.</li>
                                <li>They've nuked hundreds of accounts in the name of free speech and *yours* will be next.</li>
                                <li>Abuse women while telling how many hundreds you've loved. Nevermind that you're one ugly motherfucker and that there were 30,000 femininas 
                  that thought you were a scumbag with bad teeth.</li>
                                <li>Remember that your ko0ky klaims are 'facts', and that 'facts' do not
                  require proof.</li>
                                <li>Do not neglect to poast your responses to forums that the originator
                    doesn't read. This will make the people in that forum very impressed
                    with how you tear him to shreds without him being able to respond.
                  They like it even better if you are off-topic for that forum.</li>
                                <li>Keep in mind that lack of evidence supporting your konspiracy theory actually _is_ evidence, of how effective the konspiracy is in hiding.</li>
                                <li>Any problems with your poasts are the fault of the konspirators, who
                  are trying to stop you from preventing the extinction of humanity.</li>
                                <li>Konspiracies that are able to subvert whole governments are always
                  unable to silence konspiracy ko0ks.</li>
                                <li>The entire United States government is willing to spend millions of
                    dollars for the sole purpose of harassing you.</li>
                                <li>Hollywood is making movies based on your personal life.</li>
                                <li>Do not consult psychiatrists or other mental health professionals.
                    They are part of the konspiracy, and will sedate you and lock you away
                  and keep you drugged if you tell them the truth.</li>
                                <li>Numerology and Astrology are respectable sciences and are useful for proving your case.</li>
                                <li>Everyone is Tim Hill, or David Green, or...</li>
                                <li>There is a fine line between trolling and kookery. Find that line and
                    cross it repeatedly. When you are killfiled and/or LARTed for
                    net.abuse as a result, claim victory. If you lose multiple accounts,
                    this merely proves that you are indeed a world-class troll, with a
                  black-belt in manipulation.</li>
                                <li>If you respond to every post someone else makes, they're obsessed. If
                  they respond to less than 1% of your posts, they're even more obsessed.</li>
                                <li>Publishing people's real names, addresses, and phone numbers when
                    there's no other way for you to come out of a flamewar with any
                    dignity is cool, and proves that you are a master of secret internet
                  information stores, and absolutely not to be fucked with.</li>
                                <li>Everyone is out to get you. You can put a stop to this by telling
                    everyone that they're out to get you at every available opportunity.</li>
                                <li>You are the only sane one.</li>
                                <li>Those that give you a hard time about morally bankrupt things you
                  yourself admit to are just persecutioners of the new inquisition.</li>
                                <li>Yelling in all caps and cursing at your detractors is debate. Your
                    detractors laughing at you with sarcastic remarks is obvious anger and
                  jealousy.</li>
                                <li>If doing something results in the loss of your account, legal hassles, or blunt trauma injury, do it again. It always works better the second time. </li>
                                <li>Asterisks, lots and lots of Asterisks.</li>
                                <li>Poking holes in kookscreed is stalking, and is a felony.</li>
                                <li>K00ks LOVE to &quot;connect the dots&quot;. They are, of course, dots that only the k00k can see.</li>
                                <li>&quot;They laughed at Einstein, too!&quot; </li>

    <a href="usenet.htm">Usenet</a> Terminology Knowledge Notes (<font color=blue>UTKN</font> :-)<br></font><hr width=44% align = left>     
    
   <a name="note1"></a><br>
    <font color=blue>1</font>) <font color=blue>LART</font>: Luser Attitude Readjustment Tool.  Something large, heavy and painful.<br>
    The LART classic is a 2x4 or other large billet of wood usable as a
club, to be applied upside the head of spammers and other people who
cause sysadmins more grief than just naturally goes with the job.   
    The term began as a fanciful one; the LART was canonically a baseball
bat (in British nations, a cricket bat), or a very large piece of wood
(like two meters of fence post, or in extreme cases, a railroad tie)
used to whack the luser on the head in order to get their full and
undivided attention before delivering the real message.  It was
adopted here as already-common usage with the expectation that "firing
off a LART" would get the attention of the ISP involved, and would
cause that entity ro shut down the spammer.     
 <br>
    <a name="note2"></a><br>
     <font color=blue>2</font>) <font color=blue>Poasting</font>: "Post-Bombasting" or "Post-boasting". Posting preposterously, pompously and probably with your trousers' zip open, "à la 
     Kook", to make things clear. 
        
 <br>
    <a name="note3"></a><br>
     <font color=blue>3</font>) <font color=blue>Newsfroup</font>: Froody (cool) Newsgroup. Either a typo or an hackers and geeks slang for Newsgroup. Hard 
     to say which explanation would be worse. 
        
 <br>
    <a name="note4"></a><br>
     <font color=blue>4</font>) <font color=blue>Spnaked</font>: Vague term for an embarassing mistake of the KooK-(and troll)-artist: 
      Exposed as a spammer... caught by his own ISP and lost his emailaddress... his real personality exposed. Also typo for 'spanked' :-)
              <br>  
             <a name="note5"></a><br>
     <font color=blue>5</font>) <font color=blue>Cmsg</font>:  A
<font color=blue>control message</font> is used to:<br>

   (a) create a new group<br>
   (b) remove an existing group<br>
   (c) rename an existing group, which is actually a sequence of (a)
       followed by (b)<br>
   (d) change the status of a group from unmoderated to moderated
       or viceversa
            <br>
          
       
             <a name="note6"></a><br>
     <font color=blue>6</font>) <font color=blue>Fanboi</font>: in french it would be more or less "la clacque"&nbsp;:-) Also used for
      an 
     individual obsessed with a single target of adoration  (cfr <a href="http://www.winternet.com/~mikelr/flame94.html">Fanboy</a>, but 
     it should be written with an "<font color=blue>i</font>": <u>Fanbo<font color=blue>i</font></u> and not Fanboy, eventl plural: <font color=blue>Fanbois</font>).
            <br>
            <a name="note7"></a><br>
     <font color=blue>7</font>) 
          <font color=blue>Sneck</font>: is the noise it makes when the electrons representing a superfluous (and/or/because offending)
newsgroup on the Newsgroups (crossposted) header return to the ether void.

                 <br>
            <a name="note8"></a><br>
     <font color=blue>8</font>) 
          <font color=blue>plonk</font>, or more frequently *plonk* (the asterisks give the soundeffect):
          Used to inform someone that they have messed up and are now
          resident in a kill-file.  The claimed meaning "Put Lamer on Killfile" is prolly a back formation given 
          the high improbability of an acronymical "on".
            
            <br>  
    <a name="note9"></a><br>
    <font color=blue>9</font>) <font color=blue>NANAU</font>: news.admin.net-abuse.usenet<br>
