<i>Great stuff for seekers, truncation galore, read and take note of the many tricks...</i>
</center>
<hr>
<i>Everything began with a simple and interesting question...
</i>  
 <hr width=44%>
<b>site specific searches/filenames ?</b>
<br><br>
the-scientist.com publishes some articles that are "hot":
<br>
<br>Data derived from the Science Watch/ Hot Papers database and the Web of Science (ISI, Philadelphia) [these are paid services] show that Hot Papers are cited 50 to 100 times more often than the average paper of the same type and age.
<br>
<br>The URL for one of them is
<br>http://www.the-scientist.com/yr2002/oct/hot_021028.html
<br>
<br>How could we search for a list of "hot" articles in that site (because we / cannot /will not / should not /  pay for the original service from Science Watch)?.
<br>
<br>I tried in Google:
<br>site:www.the-scientist.com inurl:hot
<br>but it fails, I think because hot is not in the domain but in the filename
<br> 
Thanks
<br>

<i>You will admit that this is an interesting question for a seeker. A typical case of 'closed database', 
where information is hoarded instead of being freely spread. But the fundamental law 
of the web is on 
the side of the spreaders, and very strong web-winds blow against the commercial hoarders...
</i>
<hr width=44%>
<b>Re: site specific searches/filenames ?</b>
<br><br>
I think your problem is truncation... I only know to main search 
engines that perform this kind o search: altavista and hotbot
<br>
<br>Here are the queries you can use:
<br>
<br><a href="http://www.altavista.com/sites/search/web?q=%28host%3Athe-scientist.com+OR+host%3Awww.the-scientist.com%29+AND+url%3Ahot_**&avkw=qtrp&enc=iso88591&kl=XX">(host:the-scientist.com OR host:www.the-scientist.com) AND url:hot_**</a> on altavista
<br>
<br><a href="http://www.hotbot.lycos.com/text/default.asp?MT=%2B%22the-scientist.com%22+%2Bdomain%3Acom+%2Bhot_*&SM=MC&DV=0&LG=any&DC=25&DE=2&submit=Search_Hotbot&_v=2&OPs=MDRTP">+"the-scientist.com" +domain:com +hot_*</a> on hotbot
<br>
<br>the second query brings the folowing url: 
<a target=_top href="http://www.the-scientist.com/hotpapersarchive.htm">http://www.the-scientist.com/hotpapersarchive.htm</a>, maybe that's what you want. 
<br>
<br>

<i>Truncation! How important! Moreover, those among you that have visited the first link given above by Nemo will 
have noticed some URLs: <font color=red>www.the-scientist.com/yr2000/jan/hot_000110.html</font>,

<b>Re: Re: Re: site specific searches/filenames ? </b>
<br><br>        
well... heres a couple my tricks (guess thats what you'd call them :)
<br>
<br>archive org of course will give you lots of info ... however even with many url names (including nemos above) you still get delivered TOO the registration page
<br>
<br>(I am unclear as to the problem though --- it seems to indicate it is a free reg (?) and then u can proceed to read free of charge ?) thats hat i read
<br>
<br> I didn't register so am not clear or sure about this (butt you indicate that you have to pay)?
<br>
<br>butt to a trick that works sometimes ... sometimes...
<br>
<br>lets take Your posted url: http://www.the-scientist.com/yr2002/oct/hot_021028.html
<br>
<br>now lets <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&sa=G&q=%22%2Bwww.the-scientist.%2Bcom/yr2002/oct/hot_021028.html%22">feed it to google ...</a>
<br>
<br>now lets click on googles cache of (your url... or any url at the site that you have brought up in the search engine that produces the doc that you want to read)
<br>
<br>google s cache wisks you off to their Registration page ... 
<br>why?
<br>because somewhere it is reading and if and or else statement telling it you are a bad guy
<br>yes?
<br>could it be in googles cache?
<br>yup ...
<br>
<br>so, back space now back to the google page
<br>and click again on the cache link
<br><b> now VERY QUICKLY </b> <i>before it can transfer you to</i> the registration page <u>HIT YOUR STOP BUTTON</u> (if you are not quick enough u may have to try several times...
<br>
<br>you will be staring at a blank googles cache page...
<br>butt lets not stop there ... lets look at view source... [i tried 
pasting the source here but it didn't want to work correctly] ... make 
a copy of your 'source' and put it in an editor and view the html 
page :) :) works fine
<br>
<br>not only is the code for transfering you to the bad guy page there 
(i guess ---im not a coder)... butt WhalaH --- also THERE you will see 
is the article that you wanted to read in the source :) :)
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>what i find even more interesting in this little project is 
<a target=_top href="http://www.the-scientist.com/robots.txt">the scientists robots txt</a>
<br>
<pre>
User-agent: *    # applies to all robots
Disallow: /surveys
Disallow: /webreports
Disallow: /eugene_garfield
</pre>
now why in the world would they block out a specific name???
<br>google shows some rather <a href="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=%22eugene+garfield%22&num=10&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&btnG=Google+Search&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&lr=&as_ft=i&as_filetype=&as_qdr=all&as_occt=any&as_dt=i&as_sitesearch=&safe=images">nice returns</a> for that name :) [although i don't 
have time to figure out if he is listing and giving the articles essays away 
for free at his sites --- the pdf files seem to work --- or why his name is 
disallowed
<br><br>??? ohoooooooooo well geeeeeeeeeeesh -- you know the clocks were rolled BACK 
yesterday and its only 11:20 here --- but really it should be 12:20 and by 12:20 
I have had at least one beer so i guess my overactive mind isn't slowed down 
enough because of the lack of beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeer ... ok all it 
means is this i guess --- <a href="http://www.the-scientist.com/eugene_garfield/">http://www.the-scientist.com/eugene_garfield/</a>
<br>
<br>
<br>so lets re-evaluate
<br>if you try nemo's page with your url on it ... and 
click it it brings you to the registration or login page ... they 
want an email address to let you in --- yes?
<br>
<br>don't u supposse that someone who works 
there has an email address that lets him in???
<br>
<br>lets <a target=_top href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=%22the-scientist.%2Bcom%22+members&btnG=Google+Search">ask google:</a>
<br>
<br><font color=blue>well sonofabeehive ... google lists a number of members
<br>lets snatch the very first one's email address and try it</font>
<br>
<br>
<br>lets disguise this emailaddress a little here, so that the harvesting bots and others nasties 
wont index it:
<br>hcohen 
<br>at the-scientist 
<br>dot  com
<br>
<br>now let's paste that above (corrected of course, with @ and everything) into 
the email addy into the login page ... annnnnnnnnnnd
<br>
<br>what was that quote?? oh yes 'That's funny ...'" Isaac Asimov
<br>
<br>sunofabee there's your article with pictures ...
<br>
<br>(DO NOT --- mess with the guys account info should you try this --- thanks)
<br>

<br>
<br>on third thought, as i was driving to the store and re-thinking, 
i feel i did something wrong in this thread 
<br>
<br>digital was trying very hard to understand google 
and proceed at abcdefg
<br>
<br>I jumped him all the way to google - xyz
<br>
<br>i should not have done that ... because his specific 
efforts and google-questions were not really answered by my tricks
<br>
<br>i apologize digital ... please proceed with your questions 
<br><br><b>PS:</b>heheh
<br>i just finally figured out what you meant
<br>turn my javascript, in netscape, OFF
<br><i>and then</i> click on googles cache
<br>oh yeeees ... so much easier :) thanks&#33;
<br>you rock&#33; :)

<b>Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: on second thought and third thought</b><br><br>
jeff you post was excellent, also Nemo�s that showed how to master 
booleans on the engines capable of them (not google unfortunately).
<br>
<br>strangely, your findings where due to a misunderstanding:  
the URL is freely accesible directly, I wonder why google�s cache 
redirects to a sign page&#33; will have to check that. I use proxomitron 
so there are no automatic redirects :-)
<br>
<br>but sure I will apply your steps in the future, thanks

 <hr width=44%>
<i>The registration policy has probably changed over time, and as Nemo pointed 
out: "it's not so much a question of booleans, because since late 2000 
you can do that 
on google as well: <a target=_top href="http://www.searchengineshowdown.com/features/google/googleboolean.html">Boolean Searching on Google</a>. You can even use the operator <b>OR</b> inside phrases: <a target=_top href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&ie=ISO-8859-1&q=%22advertising+OR+advertisement+statistics%22">"advertising OR advertisement statistics"</a>. 
Its a problem of <u>truncation</u>. &nbsp;&nbsp;
You can use * on google, but it doesn't work in the same way... 
on google it replaces an entire word, exemple: <a target=_top href="http://www.google.com/search?num=30&hl=en&lr=&ie=ISO-8859-1&q=%22ad+augusta+*+angusta%22">"ad augusta * angusta"</a>. 

<br>On altavista you can use * or **, here is an explanation how they work: <a target=_top href="http://www.searchengineshowdown.com/features/av/#trun">truncation on altavista</a>.

<br>You can read some more information about * 
on google <a target=_top href="http://fravia.2113.ch/phplab/mbs.php3/mb001?num=-1&thread=1015612851">here</a>".

    <hr width=44%>
<b>Re: Re: Re: site specific searches/filenames ?</b>
<br><br>
&gt;I wonder why Google does not allow wildcards, it is true that most often you 
<br>&gt;get the results, but the * is very useful sometimes. 
<br>
<br>Yes, truncation is very useful sometimes... the best search engine for 
truncation was northernlight where you could use queries like this one: 
<u><font color="blue">+"*lempicka*.jpg"</font></u> hehehe... here 
is the url: <br><font size=-1 color="blue">http://www.northernlight.com/nlquery.fcg?view=extend&function=search&qr=%2B%22*lempicka*.jpg%22</font>
<br>
<br>&gt;Lets see if I understand your logic: 
<br>&gt;(host:the-scientist.com OR host:www.the-scientist.com) AND url:hot_** on &gt;altavista 
<br>&gt;is the OR here just to get all the domains if the URL changes? 
<br>&gt;won�t host:the-scientist.com catch all? 
<br>
<br>You're right host:www.the-scientist.com is contained in host:the-scientist.com, but I joined the two just in case...
<br>
<br>&gt;+"the-scientist.com" +domain:com +hot_* on hotbot 
<br>&gt;why the +domain:com here? 
<br>
<br>Because you said that the pages are in a comercial site... and you showed a working page... 
<br>

looked at the example above and ran

<br>at AV and shifted the months to get the following

<i>Once again, the power of guessing...hehe&nbsp;:-)<br>Let's just imagine that 
there exist on the web sites similar to the-scientist, this one, but 
that are not as open and freely accessible as 
this one is, and require a fee in order to access information (yes, it happens, alas). 
Let's imagine that they too have a <u>subdirectory structure</u> similar to the one 
explained above. Well, you could do the same, and 'guess' them. See, for an example,
