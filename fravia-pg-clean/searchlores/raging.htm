<br></fonT><i>This is an exceptional document (though, as usual with Humphrey P,
not very easy to read&nbsp;:-) which
 represents an ongoing exercise in order to understand some quirks
at <a href="http://www.raging.com">raging.com</a><br>A little history: The advent of Google
(clean
interface,
good algos, quick delivery of excellent results, not to mention the "cached pages"
most excellent bonus)
forced
Altavista to try to re-gain its 'core' audience, which was migrating en masse
towards
google (as funny as it may sound to you most users stick to ONE search engine for
whatever query they are performing :-(<br>Raging represents Altavista 'striking
back', and
it seems indeed a nice tool. But how does the "new" Raging engine really work and
interfaces with Altavista's databases?
That's what Humphrey and other seekers try to
understand (and explain) here...</i><br></center>

I tried the new search interface altavista provides at
http://www.raging.com<BR>Man, you'll
like
it ! It seems to have all features from altavista's simple search and there are NO
GRAFIX -
it's
a good deal faster than the 'regular' altavista web interface.<BR><BR>You'll have
to have a
look
on the way the customizing works. It is on a separate page and you customize your
results
before
or after you search. Apparently, the options are kept as long as you stay
connected.<br><br>+<br><br>I found something which might be a new feature.
At least
it
was unknown to me. <BR>Compare these two searches:<BR><FONT COLOR=blue>

the 'old'
altavista page this sets the KL-parameter to "XX", which stands for 'any
language'.<BR>The second
result I got by checking the boxes for English, French, German and Spanish on the
customizing
page. I do not know why, but the engine finds a larger number of hits when certain
languages are
chosen than by the default (which should be 'any language' here as well, shouldn't
it ?).
<br><br><BR>Does this also work with the 'old' interface ? No. As you can see
by the
following examples, only the LAST language parameter given is used.

<BR>"I" quit quite too soon in our analysis of AltaVista's new search

<BR><BR>~<BR><BR>Ok, now,  our observations are these:<BR><BR>-1-<BR>The old
www.altavista.com didn't allow several languages at a time, but took the last one
in the list.  <BR><BR>-2-<BR>with the +Gustav +"II" +Adolf query,<BR>&kl=es 27,
[&kl=xx 836,] &kl=XX 1702, &kl=en 2384<BR><BR>It's odd that there are more English
(en) that AnyLanguage (XX).<BR><BR>-3-<BR>+Gustav +"II" +Adolf +Bilbao
query.<BR>&kl=es 2, &kl=xx 6, &kl=en 13, &kl=XX 35<br><br>There are less
&kl=xx than &kl=en, but more &kl=XX than &kl=en.  Apparently XX means intersection
(inclusive vs exclusive OR)<BR><BR>-4- (Today)<BR>However, in our first set of
facts, we don't see how the XX (1702) included all the EN
(2284)<BR><BR>~~~<BR><BR>Did I get the facts stated correctly, this
time?<BR><BR>~<BR><BR>All we've managed to do, so far, is to watch the shadow of
<BR>"altavista.com/cgi-bin/query?"   from a distance on different terrain at two
different times of day.  We're not close to making a sundial, yet.<BR><BR>What you
really want, is to have a look at the source.  <BR>Well, how big is it, and what
is it called?<BR><BR>And we are assuming there is a difference in terrain?  That
"ragingsearch.altavista.com/cgi-bin/query?"  is really different from
"www.altavista.com/cgi-bin/query?"   -?-  We just want to know how it's
different.<BR><BR>~<BR><BR>I should learn more about CGI, instead of just
guessing, don't you think?  Although CGI is not a language, but rather a way of
doing things, there should be constraints.<BR><BR>Lets see,  what do I want to
find.<BR><BR>-1-<BR>There's a page of parameters somewhere for AltaVista...<BR>kl
means language, ...<BR><BR>-2-<BR>Some time ago, we were looking for original
development and doctorial thesis and white papers and user's manuals, but
"everybody" got bored with that...  I'd bet the original database design hasn't
changed much from then.  Might shutup and go looking again.  Berkely, wasn't it.

Do you suppose, someone has liberated "query?" and posted it somewhere?  Can you
use an altavista search engine on your own pages?  Who has done that and then went
fishing and is just sitting there, like a wrecked ship?<BR><BR>~~<BR><BR>Lets see.
What do I want to know:<BR><BR>-a-<BR>Is it always a script?  Nahh.  Could be
Perl.  Could be C.  Could be any language.  Anything to take information from the
"QUERY_STRING" or from STDIN, and send it to STDOUT.<BR><BR>-b-<BR>What am I going
to find in /cgi-bin/ -?-  A program?  Nothing?  (Everybody will want their's to be
named "query.")<BR><BR>-c-<BR>Even if I know it's name, will I be able to download
it from /cgi-bin/ -?-  (Maybe the subdirectory is protected.  Maybe the actual
program is named something different.  Maybe sending the URL activates the
program, rather than selecting it for download.  Is GET or POST always
implied?)<BR><BR>-d-<BR>How do you put it there?  Or is it even there?  Maybe you
just tell the sysadmin about it, and he tells the server that when you see an URL
of www.altavista.com/ccgi-bin/query? you lookup "query" in a table and locate
whatever program is associated whereever you told him it was.<BR><BR>- That when
you see an URL of ragingsearch.altavista.com/ccgi-bin/query? you find a different
entry in a table, and associate a different program with it...<BR>OR, ragingsearch
sends the URL to a separate server...<BR>OR, ragingsearch is read out of the URL
and the first simple change at the top of the program "query?" branches to the
"ragingsearch" variations, whereever.   <BR><BR>- The last one is most likely.
They wouldn't penalize you for trying the new thing by confining you to one
server.  Besides, backup and mirroring is complicated enough, without inventing
exceptions.<BR><BR>~~<BR>Hmmm.  I don't know what it feels like. It will feel
differently, when I know something.<BR><BR>~<BR>Or, can you give me a Zen dope
slap, and fix my attention upon the truth in a minute?<BR><BR>Do it!

 (31,548) <P> What a difference ! But do you see where I want to go ? Why have I choosen
such an uninterressant query ? The huge number of results ! <P> Scooter's manual, page 32 :
&quot;A new option on the avs_search (<font color=red>timeout</font>) and a
new api call (<font color=red>avs_timer</font>) allows multi-threaded
applications to enforce maximum query processing times.&quot; <P> A few lines down in the manual,
it's explained that the administrator can
define the applications which have a timer, and which ones do not have one. <P> I think you've
come to the same conclusion as I do (which may be wrong, of
course, but which should be logic) : a multi-language querry (xx), which
would take necessarely more time to be executed than a specific language
query, will have a timer setted. On the contrary, a specific one won't
..... (errr.. I'm not sure about this one nevertheless) <P>  <P> Ok, we now know that a
multi-language query has a timer.... BUT, if there
are few results, we can assume that the timer won't be reached... Error ! <P>  <A

 (70) <P> Haha ! Do you imagine that when searching for special material you only see
2 results, althought there are at least 70 !!!!
So, provided that Altavista detects a multi-language querry, the timer is
setted off, and ALWAYS reached.. Too bad for us : we do not have access to
all the datases with a muti-language search. <P>
Another example : <P>  <A

 (2) <P> I know the results have nothing to do with the subject of the search, but I
don't care.... You see here that a (so-called) non results querry could
actually have somes. Terrifying ! <P>  <P> As a conclusion : ALWAYS make single language queries
! <P> A thing is confuse in my mind, nevertheless : why should the timer be
reached, if there are few results ?????? Maybe people at Altavista don't
want their servers to be overloaded... But I doubt of this... I'm tired. <P>

<BR><BR><BR>Testing with [+Gustav +"II" +Adolf], comparing the expected number of hits with the

<BR>There's a system. Do you see it ?   <BR><BR><BR>Every language seems to lose a certain number
of hits (compared to when it is used as only language parameter) when combined with another
language. I first suspected this, when there were two hits less for [pt + pl] than I had
expected, and in combination with [ro] each of these languages seemed to have one hit less.
<BR><BR>I tried a language without any hits (lv) and combined it with both German and English.
[de + lv] showed 395 results less than I had expected, [en + lv] 285 less. If I was right, [en +
de] should show 285 + 395 = 680 results less than the sum of each language alone. Indeed

this CGI works like or what their database is like (THAT would be an interesting point !)<BR>I
don't know if you can use something like Oracle with 350.000.000 records and still expect a
reasonable response time for your SQL selects. Well, in the end I'm back at the beginning: Ich

Oh, I get it.  (finally.)<BR><BR>If you were to design a search engine, you would let
the advanced search go longer, or try harder, but cut the simple searcher off
sooner.<BR><BR>You are assuming that the simple searcher doesn't want to wait,
or doesn't care about the last few million 'Treffe' the 'pinball' search engine
makes?<BR><BR>The problem with stopping before searching the whole database, is
that the newest item might be the last one in the database,  and you'd come away
thinking that AltaVista never updated their database...<BR><BR>or, the one which
best matches your string of keywords, might be in the part of the database the
search engine never got to.<BR><BR>It would be better to presort, to preindex, to
presearch, to run on the fastest available machinery, anything you could do to
optimize searching, in order to make the whole database available to both the simple
searcher and the one who customized his search.<BR><BR>But, the presentation is
very important, and very different...  In the simple search, you are making
assumptions for the searcher.  Call them defaults, call them design flaws,
call them public relations... <BR><BR>You've been to a wonderful site before,
haven't you?  You know they have something, but the site has so many pages,
and no sitemap, so you decide to use their search engine.  And you give it a
two or three word search, and the search engine says: 'nothing found.' 
You know it is there.  But you don't know the one word which would find
it.<BR><BR>I've written some of those bafflers myself - design flaws. 
<BR>jeff's lookime for fravia was like that...  I couldn't quite get
it to give me the results I wanted. For instance, trying to find 'java,'
but not 'java&nbsp;script.'  <BR>Lets don't pick on jeff.  He grabbed
what he could.  There are lots of other conundrum site search engines
at Big companies.<BR><BR>You get way too many hits with one word. 
And with two words, you either get no hits, as though it had to be
a phrase (tight AND)  <BR><BR>Or else the simple engine assumes the two
words don't need to have anything in common, nor refer to
the same topic, but just appear on the same page (lazy OR.)<BR><BR>Or
else the 'lucky' way of using the engine is there, and 'natural' to the
programmer, but not to anyone else.  (That's the kind I write.)<BR><BR>AltaVista,
after scanning it's 'billions and billions,' will put the entries in the
order of 'most found first,' ... 'least found last.'<BR><BR>~<BR><BR>Google,
since you brought it up, is running a popularity contest, and putting up
front those sites which others most often refer to.  And besides that,
they consult a WWW directory.<BR><BR>(By the way, you should be able to
improve your site's 'popularity' by writing your section of that web
directory.)<BR><BR>Here's a query on [search engine optimization] which

I'm not saying that Open Directory Project has considered the whole web. Nor that ODP
is better than Yahoo, (it's not.)  But just that Google uses this Open Directory to
form an 'opinion' about what is important, and what's popular.  And it could be
your opinion which they are considering.  After that, they have their own

there's another one.  If you thought you were going to be interrupted, you might

question.  You might keep processing, but with diminishing expectations that he will
ask a further question.  If you can, keep his answered question in short term memory,
so you can pick up your search from there.<BR><BR>~~<BR><BR>Gahhh!  This is all
theoretical... <BR><BR>How do they do it?  How do they do it?<BR><BR>The maggots
know.  <BR><BR>(they put 'fravia' in every erotic keyword string... no. -
