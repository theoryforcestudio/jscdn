<i>Reading the material you find around the web about evaluation,
you will notice that it boils down
to some common 'basic' rules. The problem is that, like all generic rules, they are
 -by a long shot- not valid 
enough. Therefore, even if they were all valid, the capability  
to 'feel' if a site is bogus (or not) will still require 
some '<font color=blue>Fingerspitzengefühl</font>' which amounts to a combination of experience 
and subtle intuition, to acquire the uncanny insight of
  accurately perceiving fake constructions and attitudes.
<br>Basically  
I believe that 
looking for information on the Internet 
you will need to use the same <SPAN STYLE="color: black; background: yellow">critical 
evaluative skills</span> that 
you would use when choosing or  reading 
 a book, when choosing or using a paper index, when choosing or evaluating a musical 
 score, or 
when deciding about the value of a database. 
For this reason you should by all means and aforemost 
head    
</i><font color=blue>[</font><a href="evaluate.htm">Sielaff's</a><font color=blue>]</font><i> teachings.
</i></center>
<br><br>Let's have a closer look, evaluating critically the data 
you'll  find is more and more important within the morass of networked 
data, where the few 
valuable nuggets are submerged by an incredible amount of junk.
<ol>
<lI><SPAN STYLE="color: black; background: yellow">Internal</span> (Intrinsic) <SPAN STYLE="color: black; background: yellow">clues</span> to the 'credibility' of the target
site 
<ol>
<li><font color=blue>Author's own qualifications</font>
<br>
<i>Of paramount importance, yet watch it! You must not just believe what HE HIMSELF says! 
<a href="stalking.htm">Stalking</a> and <a href="combing.htm">combing</a> techniques may come handy to check his 
assertions.</i>
</li> 
<li><font color=blue>Bibliographical precision</font>
<br>
<i>Watch it! Many studies LOOK professional, but scanning the references you'll 
quickly realise they are not even at ordinary universitary level (besides NOT ALL 
universities are equal: is the university where the study / author 'dwells' an university, 
or study institute, 
with a certified track of competence or is it just "some kind" of university? 
You would not 
believe how many universities nowadays are fighting hard to keep at levels 
any good <u>secundary school</u> had thirty years ago&nbsp;</i>:-(<br>

</li>
<li><font color=blue>Style patterns and Language correctness</font><br> 
<i>Careful, very careful with this on a multilinguistical web!<br>Like the previous 
one, a difficult clue to use. Take for instance 
a good messageboard, with significative multinational partecipation, like 
<a href="links.htm#msgb">one of these</a>. You may (<u>may</u> underlined) 
find snippets of incredibly valuable knowledge in pidgin english, full of 
mistakes, dotted with 
unscientific references. On the other hand, often enough, 
you'll find preposterous university-thesis 
with lengthy wording, perfectly correct, and exact scientific layout, yet 
with no knowledge value whatsoever.
</i></li>
<li><font color=blue>Update frequency</font> 
<br><i>Quite important. You may reasonably expect better value and competence on a site that is 
continuously updated vis-a-vis a site that 'does not move' for months (or years). The 
usual caveats apply, though: updates must regard CONTENT, not just frills.

</i>
</li>
<li><font color=blue>Timestamps (chronological indications)</font>
<br><i>VERY important: veritatem dies aperit  (Time discovers truth). 
You'll quickly notice how many sites DO NOT DATE their documents, and even 
go to great lenghts in order to avoid the possibility that you could infer 
their real publication date. The 
simple reason for this is that those sites FEAR 'LOOKING' OBSOLETE. 
Our perception (skewed by 
propaganda and advertisement) is that 'new' research 
means 'better' research. This is absolutely not true (the contrary is quite often the 
case, see <font color=blue>[</font><a href="evaluate.htm">Sielaff's</a><font color=blue>]</font><i> teachings) 
but this untruth, being perceived as such, is worshipped on lazy sites 
('Readers should not know that 
this stuff is rather old').</i> 

</i>
</li>

<li><font color=blue>Bias</font><br> 
<i>Most 'apparently' academic sites avoid polemic and 
prefer an "equilibrated essay style". This is 
often due to the 'mimicking' of the scientific style as perceived by the broad 
public. In the reality valuable scientific research does not 
avoid confrontation, never. To establish a new theory 
(not just trivial addendums) means 
mostly to DESTROY established (and 'cherished' and 'bread-gaining') theories. This is 
even more true on the Web, where  you can "publish and be damned" with an ease that 
would be impossible in the academic world.<br>
Yet bias can indeed constitute a clue in 'negative' sense as well: excessive obsession 
with own 
theories (taking them very seriously) is a classical sign of boiled air 
content.

</ol> 

<br>
Some of these rules are (at least in part)
correct, yet some of them are QUITE obsolete. This being the case -for
instance- for rule 1.3 (style and language). this kind of 
approach does not have much
sense on a more and more
pidging-english and multi-cultural web, where a very valuable
apport can be expressed
with a very poor english. You should not care about the
presentation,
spelling, or grammar of the written work that
you evaluate except when the wording is so unclear that the
message
results unclear, imprecise, or ambiguous.<br>I am personally
unconvinced by rule
1.6: the <u>apparent</u> lack of bias and political correctness
of the textes being  often just a simple rethorical cover for very
partisan positions ("look!
It looks really like I'm really neutral and unbiased, my dear 
friend and future client"). Note that the viewpoint of the site may be 
explicit -say included in a
scope statement-  or you may be able to confirm your suspicions
only   analyzing the point of view that 'transpares' through 
the contents of the site, which you should by all means always do, 
scepticism is a very sound attitude when perusing the web.<br>
Rule 2.1, on the other hand, is patently absurd only if it tries
to
identify a 'positive' style for evaluation purposes, but I
personally
found that it is after all a useful rule for judging immediately
the 'negativeness' of the sites you found, as I will
explain below.
<bR><br>But the rules above need to be implemented:<bR> 
        A common problem is due to the many 'hidden' forms and techniques to smuggle   
<SPAN STYLE="color: black; background: yellow">advertising</span> inside the pages you will find, 
which
seem definitely more difficult to differentiate -&nbsp;on the net&nbsp; than 
in printing, 
on the streets or in
mass media & television  channels. The various techniques used for 
<font color=blue>[</font><a href="realicra/realicra.htm">reality cracking</a><font color=blue>]</font> purposes can come 
-&nbsp;I believe&nbsp;- very handy in such contexts.
<bR><br>Note that very often the commercial label of a given font is
blurred: a growing number of sites may have started out
because some people felt that the content belonged on the web, but
now many of these sites wish to take advantage of their 'position'. I doubt that 
you'll be able to find nowadays 
many "important" sites without any advertisement whatsoever (bar mine :-)
<bR>Your own maturity is required: the important thing to pay attention 
to is whether a
site has valuable content or not and whether its presentation or 
biases make any difference in terms of what <u>you</u> need to get out of
it. 
<br><br>
Yet another problem is due to the incredible "individual" possibilities 
and to the half-anonymous character of the media: 
it is definitely possible on the web for individuals  to 
share working papers or
information they have been working on very seriously, but 
as you can imagine, there is no guarantee that this work 
has undergone <SPAN STYLE="color: black; background: yellow">a rigorous review 
process</span>, in fact it hasn't probably 
been through the
peer review processes that are intrinsic to scholarship  (even if those 
same processes are very often far from being perfect, as anyone that 

works in an university knows). This opens the doors to all sort of scams: you 
could easily (with a little phantasy and a little research) put up a beautiful 
'University of Cordonshire' and start distributing interesting 
courses for distance learning MBAs that would have more or less the same chances of success 
that all the other scam schemes that already exist (have a look at the last dozen 
pages of each issue of 'The Economist' if you want to see a nice mix of pseudo 
and bogus "universities" offering MBAs aplenty and targeting ignorant CEOs that need 
some kind of university 
papers on-the-fly&nbsp;:-)<bR><br>
Anyway the fact that the work you must evaluate was not 
examinated and did not went through 'the <SPAN STYLE="color: black; background: yellow">trade 
publishing industry</span>' has 
some disadvantages and  
not only advantages&nbsp;:-)
<br><br>Note moreover that the 'free' characteristics of the Web 
stimulates the experimentation, by all types of publishers, of various forms of 
<SPAN STYLE="color: black; background: yellow">parallel publishing</span> 
with -say- a printed magazine and the supplementary publishing of
 "some" information on the Internet, mostly holding back
some important stuff in order to sell the print publication.<bR> 
Since in most cases there is somewhere a 'correspondent'  
database on-line (which requires payment to be accessed), power seekers will 
probably -&nbsp;ahem&nbsp;- have to learn to 
find their way to the 'unrestricted' publications as well. It is nevertheless 
important to realize that most of the results you will get from a search may be 
(for profit reasons) in their 'crippled' form, and you will have to 'cut deeper' 
to get the meat, should you fancy to do it.

<br><bR>
So, once more, I will not deny that some of the rules listed above are (at
least in part) correct, but
I would like to add some rules of mine, that I found VERY valuable
in order to quickly
evaluate results in our more and more commercially infested
web.</i><br>

"Slides" style crap</font><br>
More and more sites have adopted a zombizied "slide-presentation"
model.  You have to click
a dozen times to scrap together the (meager) content that could
have been presented -&nbsp;and
 more easily printed&nbsp;- on a
single unique page. The point is exactly that: minimum data, maximum spamming.<br> 
Such crap-sites are designed, 
built and 'ameliorated' on the "visual"
assumption that zombies
will never print any info anyway, being too busy 'butterflying' from
one site to another without construct whatsoever.<bR>This slide-sliding is -obviously- not only limited to the 
net. But on the web nowadays
many 
many sites present scarce info in a "crumble" way that
bores searchers to death. See also point 7 (Powerpoint) below.<br>

<br>
<li><font size=+2>
statistical tricks: tables</font> <br>
Every now and then you can find some <u>tables</u> on the web. There are some rules that 
apply to ALL tables, no matter what are they  specifically related to. 
<br>Have a good look at them: tables are 
very easy to reverse. As a first rule: the more 'grid lines' and -even more important- the 
more 'white space' 
you see and find in those tables  the  harder it will be to compare data... 
(see on these same lines also 'the slide 
problem' described above). This dictates a very handy rule: <font color=blue>lotta unused grids & space... hey! Throw that 
table away!</font><br><br>Some useful additional 'parameters':<br>
Are the LABELS (of those tables) clear?<br>
Are the LABELS (of those tables) complete?<br>
Are those tables ordered in columns? (a sequence of numbers is easier to follow down a 
column rather 
than across a row, duh)<br>
And, this being the case... are the most important columns EVIDENT or are they buried in the middle of the tables?<br>




</li>



<br>
<li><font size=+2>
statistical tricks: charts & graphs</font><br>
When faced with charts, always check the <u>vertical scale</u> to make sure that it has 
not been expanded to make a small change look large or worse, inverted, to make a fall look like a rise.
<br>
Remember that SCALES are extremely important when analyzing graphs:<br>
scales that do not start form zero will exagerate modest movements<br>
logarithmic scales will flatten out every increase.<br>
The moment you see a scale that do not start from zero or is logarithmic, you have VERY GOOD REASONS 
to suspect <u>why</U> 
they did present it so&nbsp;:-)

</li>

<br>
<li><font size=+2>
Powerpoint slides</font> <br>
See also point 1 about the "crumbles" of information on some sites.
<br>Powerpoint is THE distinctive tract of idiocy.  If someone uses powerpoint, you can be SURE it is not worth remaining on 
the side (or in the room): go away IMMEDIATELY. Any  PowerPoint presentation elevates format over content. It's commercialism 
stupidity at its worst, turning everything into a sales pitch. The anti-knowledge tool 
par excellence, loved by idiots all over the world. With powerpoint even the
few pre-chewed
 "ideas" hidden inside the bambinesque noise, are simplified to the point that they become 
 redundant and unclear.
