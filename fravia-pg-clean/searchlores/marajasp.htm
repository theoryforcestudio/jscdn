Hi Fravia,

I have been following your site for the last one month, all that I can
say is: its Fantabulous!!
I have read the articles on CGI scripts cracking, but ASP (Active Server
Pages) cracking doesnt seem to have been discussed till now.   
So I thought I should write something about this 'technology' from 
our Micro$oft's friends...

Active Server Page reversing
<br><br>
By Indian Maharaja
<br><br>

Tools Required :
<br><br>
Nothing but your browser .
<br><br>

When M$ launched Windoze NT server, it was trying to compete against
existing
Unix platforms.<br><br>
Since Billy boy couldnt make much progress he had this idea of
'bundling'
software, to snare 
people who thought that all the software was for 'free'.
<br><br>
One of the many bloatwares that were launched were SQL-Server (an
abomination
of a rdbms), 
IIS (Internet Info server).  Now M$ decided CGI was a worthless
technology
(since they couldnt 
control it) , so they laucnhed something called ISAPI (Internet Server
Api). <br><br>
If you look, at
the documentation for IIS, it mentions full support for CGI, but you
will find
the documentation 
littered with references as to why Isapi is a million times greater and
better
than CGI.<br><br>
Lets prove the opposite..:-)
<br><br>
So what really is Asp ? Its availlable for download from the M$
website, but
it requires 
IIS or PWS (personal web server installed). (Install Exe is 9Megs+  if
this
isnt bloatware
at its best then I am not maharaja).<br><br>
Basically Asp is a wrapper on Isapi and allows server side scripting
using
VeeBee Script 
or JavaScript (sorry JScript -- m$ version of Javascript).
<br><br>
A vey simple asp script is some thing like :
<prE>
&lt;HTML&gt;
&lt;%Response.Write("Hello")%&gt; 
&lt;/HTML&gt;

which will result in a htm =&gt;  

&lt;HTML&gt;
Hello
&lt;/HTML&gt;
</pre>
which is downloaded to the clients machine, so if I do a view source I
can see
only the 
resultant HTM , and not the Asp code as this translated to HTM on the
server
and then sent.
<br><br>
So what people generally do is keep all the code for validating
Passwords,
redirecting to 
hidden pages inside the Asp file , and based on some user input show
only the
required 
things to the user. Even if the user does a view-source he can see only
the
downloaded htm.
It would be very nice if we could see the Asp source...
<br><br>
There are very many sites using Asp and still more sites using Isapi
Dlls. <br><br>
Since Asp 
is a wrapper (a filter as the documentation says) on Isapi, it is
possible to
write Dlls using 
VeeCee++ (ver 5.0 has an App-wizard option for that) and Mfc which can
provide
lower level 
functionality.
<br><br>
If you find a page like this www.indianmaharaja.com/default.asp =&gt;
bulls-eye
this site uses 
Asp.
<br><br>
If you find a page like this
www.indianmaharaja.com/validate.dll?12473636 =&gt;
most probably it 
is an Isapi dll.
<br><br>
So lets get down to business...
<br><br>
1)  if you are on an Asp page do this :
	www.indianmaharaja.com/default.asp::$DATA
	You will find that either the Asp code is dispalyed in your browser
window
(or)
	a download window pops up which allows you to download the Asp.
	
<br><br>
So much for code security.
	It seems its a bug in Isapi and a fix is availlable at m$ sites.
	All the micro$oft sites have run this fix :-( . But I found many-many
other
web sites , 
	who are still running the unfixed version :-).
<br><br>
 
2)	Next I checked out a site which was using an Isapi dll, I tried
doing this
:<br><br>
	www.indianmaharaja.com/validate.dll 
	(entering just the name of the dll) -- nope i got a message :
	'Hackers keep off'
	Too bad, so I tried the trick specified in 1)
	www.indianmaharaja.com/validate.dll::$DATA
	Bingo ! I was able to download the dll.
	 <br><br>
	I racked my brains as to how such a HUGE security hole could be there,
I
still havent 
	been able to figure it out.  Most probably it is because of lousy
coding done
by the M$ 
	loving bozos or it was there for some devious reason known only to M$.
<br><br>
3)	The story doesnt end here ...  my next assignment was of running Asp
on
Apache 	Server 
	for NT.  M$ never provided a version of Asp (i.e.Isapi) for web
servers other
than 
	IIS.  A company called ChilliSoft provides a version called ChilliAsp
which
runs on 
	Apache for NT(I dont know why anybody would want to run Asp in the 1st
place). <br><br>
	ChilliAsp availlable for download from M$'s site builder network site.
	Now if you have an Asp file with a long file name say :
	<br><br>
	www.indianmaharaja.com/passwordval.asp
<br><br>
	if you type the short file name in the browser
<br><br>
	www.indianmaharaja.com/passwo~1.asp -- unbelievably the download
window pops
up and you 
	can download the asp script.
	I have noticed this problem only in the apache version of asp.  Though
a fix
might be 
	availlable now ( i am not sure), there could be many sites....
<br><br>

4)	One more screwup -- that is most commonly done by the person who
wrote the
Asp scripts ,
	Sometimes when I do a view source of a .asp file in my browser I get
something like this 
	along with just the html :
<prE>
	&lt;!--#include file = "inc/encrypt.inc"--&gt;
	&lt;!--#include file = "inc/AdminChk.inc"--&gt;
	&lt;HTML&gt;
	.
	.
	Other stuff
	.
	.
	&lt;/HTML&gt;	
	</prE>
	What the bozo who created the page has done is include some common
.asp code
(like 
	validation routines which are used across pages) in a .inc file .
	Now if the page being viewed was :
	www.indianmaharaja.com/login.asp
	<br><br>
	just type in :
	www.indianmaharaja.com/inc/encrypt.inc
	<br><br>
	your browser will promptly download this file . 
	Open the file and you have something like this :
	<prE>
	&lt;SCRIPT RUNAT=SERVER&gt;
	Function Encrypt(theStr)	
	..
	..
	..
	End Function
	&lt;/SCRIPT&gt; 
</prE>
	what you will see is the complete asp code.
<br><br>
Hope you find this information useful in the continuing battle against
billy's
boys at Micro$oft.
