<P><B>Searching the Internet For Historical Information</B></P>
<br><P>Historical information can be hard to find on the internet.
<br>This paper starts by listing a few of these difficulties.
<br>The rest is a live experiment where I try to figure out
<br>how to do historical research using the internet.
<br>I hope to provide some tips to help others do research
<br>on the internet.
<br></P>
<br><P><B>History is Hard Work</B></P>
<br><P>Asking questions about history can be a lot of work.
<br>Here's how Sir James George Frazer opened his preface to
<br>the abridged edition of
<br><I>The Golden Bough</I>.</P>
<br><BLOCKQUOTE>The primary aim of this book is to explain the remarkable rule
<br>which regulated the succession to the priesthood of Diana at Aricia.
<br>When I first set myself to solve the problem more than thirty years ago,
<br>I thought that the solution could be propounded very briefly,
<br>but I soon found that to render it probable or even intelligible
<br>it was necessary to discuss certain more general questions,
<br>some of which had hardly been broached before.
<br>In successive editions, the enquiry has branched out in more and
<br>more directions, until the two volumes of the original work
<br>have expanded into twelve.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<br><P>The task of gathering and evaluating information
<br>can be a lifelong project,
<br>even for a seemingly simple question.
<br>Here are just a few of the difficulties.
<br></P>
<br><P>For primary written material</P>
<br><UL>
<br>    <LI>You might need background knowledge to locate resources.</LI>
<br>    <LI>You almost always need considerable background knowledge to evaluate resources.</LI>
<br>    <LI>Written primary sources may be badly damaged.</LI>
<br>    <LI>The writing, language, or both might not yet be deciphered or interpreted.</LI>
<br>    <LI>The writing, language, or both may suffer from multiple interpretations.</LI>
<br>    <LI>The language may not be well understood, either in general, or by the seeker.</LI>
<br>    <LI>The culture may lack relevant literary material, even if it is otherwise rich on written material.</LI>
<br>    <LI>The material might not be available.
<br>        Much of what has been translated has not been published.</LI>
<br>    <LI>Even when written primary material is adequately translated, the meaning or applicability can evade interpretation.</LI>
<br>    <LI>It is often difficult to evaluate bias in written material without examining multiple sources, which are often not available.</LI>
<br>    <LI>The authenticity of primary material is not always a given.</LI>
<br>    <LI>And finally, the information you seek may never have been written, let alone discovered.</LI>
<br></UL>
<br><P>For non written material</P>
<br><UL>
<br>    <LI>Difficulties in interpretation are only compounded with non-written artifacts.</LI>
<br>    <LI>The context in which certain artifacts are used is important, and often this is not understood.</LI>
<br>    <LI>An artifact found outside its natural context may lead to false interpretations.</LI>
<br>    <LI>Depictions appearing on artifacts provide multiple contexts: for the artifact, depiction, and the combination.</LI>
<br>    <LI>Access to artifacts is often limited to help preserve the artifacts or for cultural reasons.
<br>        Only those with appropriate credentials and clout can gain access, and even then,
<br>        access is often severely restricted.</LI>
<br>    <LI>Artifacts that are available are scattered across the globe in museums.
<br>        Often only a few artifacts are on display, the rest hidden away in the museum's storage rooms.</LI>
<br></UL>
<br><P>Secondary sources add more difficulties</P>
<br><UL>
<br>    <LI>Specialized information is often difficult to locate, use, and evaluate.</LI>
<br>    <LI>Detailed historical information is of limited use,
<br>        so resources can be hard to find, even off the internet.</LI>
<br>    <LI>The information may be lying in some dusty old thesis library,
<br>        or a storage room where you'll never learn about it.</LI>
<br>    <LI>You may be asking a question that hasn't been answered, or hasn't been answered satisfactorily.</LI>
<br>    <LI>Secondary sources can be biased</LI>
<br>    <LI><UL>
<br>        <LI>Selection of material (inclusion, rejection) is a judgement call, which is often biased.</LI>
<br>        <LI>The writer's choice of method (school of thought) will produce a particular bias.</LI>
<br>        <LI>Political, professional, religious, and other types of personal bias can reflect on the material.</LI>
<br>        <LI>The writer may deliberately attempt to mislead.</LI>
<br>        <LI>Some schools of thought believe that bias is an inherent part of what historians do.
<br>            They go so far as to say that history is the study of historians.</LI>
<br>    </UL></LI>
<br>    <LI>The sources and methods used can be shoddy.</LI>
<br></UL>
<br><P>Researching on the internet adds some difficulties, but also solves a few problems.</P>
<br><UL>
<br>    <LI>Primary materials are not available on the internet, but
<br>        copies and photographs of such material may be available.</LI>
<br>    <LI>Raw archaeological field data is being made available on the internet
<br>        by several current archaeological projects as the digs progress.</LI>
<br>    <LI>Museums are slowly beginning to publish virtual exhibits to display
<br>        their materials in pictures and multimedia panoramas.
<br>        These exhibits typically include information panels,
<br>        sometimes beyond what is available in the museum itself.</LI>
<br>    <LI>Museums are still stuffy old institutions that guard their possessions.
<br>        Most do not allow cameras in the museum,
<br>        nor do they allow visitors to view the vast
<br>        amount of materials in the store rooms.
<br>        They are hesitant to freely publish pictures of their material
<br>        or make copies of textual material available.
<br>        This is changing slowly, as mentioned above.</LI>
<br>    <LI>History isn't exactly a popular subject, but some of the
<br>        issues you deal with are. Sometimes, a more popular treatment
<br>        can hide the stuff you're interested in. If this happens with your subject
<br>        it can be hard to get past the more popular stuff to
<br>        the things that interest you.</LI>
<br></UL>
<br><P>Finally, there are some general rules about information that apply, particularly for the internet.</P>
<br><UL>
<br>    <LI>Search engines are dumb.</LI>
<br>    <LI>The vast majority of information on the internet consists of a simple
<br>        overview of the subject. As simplifications, they are often misleading.</LI>
<br>    <LI>The caveat about bias in secondary sources applies especially on the internet
<br>        where misrepresentation and deceit are the rule, not the exception.</LI>
<br>    <LI>The validity of anything you find on the internet is suspect.
<br>        The cost of publishing on the internet is very low.
<br>        Traditional constraints imposed by publishing firms do not apply.
<br>        This means there is no editorial vetting, authority, quality, or
<br>        any other measure to restrict the free flow of unadulterated garbage.
<br>        Verify everything independent of the internet, if at all possible.</LI>
<br></UL>
<br><P><B>A Simple Beginning</B></P>
<br><P>The naive approach to searching is to put some relevant words
<br>or phrases into a search engine and look through the first few
<br>results for a quick answer. This is sometimes successful.
<br>It is a valid approach when you need a simple overview,
<br>need to verify a simple fact, or when you know where
<br>something is but don't know the URL.
<br></P><P>
<br>It is also successful when the search engine is tuned to provide
<br>the kind of answer you're looking for. For example,
<br>the rage today is to rank web sites by popularity.
<br>If you're looking for one of the most popular sites
<br>for a given subject, this naive approach is likely
<br>to be successful.
<br></P><P>
<br>For this experiment, I chose a random sentence from a random book on history.
<br>The book is the 1964 Norton Library Press edition of the 1952 second edition of
<br><I>A History of Greek Religion</I> by Martin P. Nilsson,
<br>translated at some point from Swedish to English by F. J. Fielden.
<br>I opened to a random page (p 187), and near the top found the following sentence:</P>
<br><BLOCKQUOTE>The prohibition against pouring libations
<br>with unwashed hands is as old as Homer.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<br><P>
<br>Using the naive approach, I pick out the important words
<br>and type the following query into google's query window.</P>
<br><BLOCKQUOTE>"unwashed hands" libations homer</BLOCKQUOTE>
<br><P>
<br>In response, google returns exactly one link to a pdf file entitled
<br><I>Homer: The Simile as Textual Stratagem</I>.
<br>I open the document in acroread,
<br>hit Ctrl-F, type in <EM>unwashed</EM>, and find that the pdf contains
<br>the word "unwashed" exactly once.
<br>It is the Greek original with English  translation of
<br><I>The Iliad</I> book 6, lines 226-8.</P>
<br><BLOCKQUOTE>I fear to pour out the gleaming wine to Zeus
<br>with unwashed hands; nor is it permissible to pray to the son of Kronos
<br>who is shrouded in the clouds when spattered with blood and gore.
<br></BLOCKQUOTE>
<br><P>
<br>Was this search successful?
<br>It may seem so, but it fails on a number of counts.
<br>The most important problem is that
<br>I never defined what I wanted to find, so
<br>there's no way to determine whether or not this
<br>answers the question.
<br></P>
<br><P><B>What Were We Searching For?</B></P>
<br><P>Let's take another look at that quote.
<br>This time I'll pretend I'm reading it for the first time
<br>and that something about it caught my interest.</P>
<br><BLOCKQUOTE>The prohibition against pouring libations
<br>with unwashed hands is as old as Homer.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<br><P>Now, that's a bold statement,
<br>even for someone as respected as Mr. Nilsson.
<br>There's no footnote for this sentence.
<br>The context is purification rites and taboos,
<br>but that tells me all of nothing.
<br>For all I know, Mr. Nilsson made this up.
<br>Now this is something specific I want to find out.
<br></P><P>
<br>Is it true that this prohibition is as old as Homer?
<br></P><P>
<br>We already did the search.
<br>We'll evaluate those same results to see if this was a
<br>successful search to the new question.
<br></P>
<br><BLOCKQUOTE>I fear to pour out the gleaming wine to Zeus
<br>with unwashed hands; nor is it permissible to pray to the son of Kronos
<br>who is shrouded in the clouds when spattered with blood and gore.
<br></BLOCKQUOTE>
<br><P>
<br>Do the results answer the question?
<br>That depends on what you already know.
<br>This may seem to answer the question,
<br>but it's not entirely clear whether or not this prohibition
<br>applies only to hands drenched in blood.
<br>It's also not clear whether it applies to pouring libations
<br>or only to praying.
<br>It also only talks about Zeus, not the "deathless gods",
<br>or the gods and daemons in general, or heroes.
<br>If you look at several
<br>translations, or if you merely read that pdf document,
<br>you also know that there's a translation question here.
<br>What we did learn is that <EM>in this particular case</EM>
<br>someone adamantly refused to pour libations to Zeus while
<br>his hands were drenched in blood.
<br>If you read the book, you know that this is Hector,
<br>and that he had just returned from battle,
<br>and his hands were drenched in human blood.
<br>So this doesn't prove that there was a general prohibition
<br>against pouring libations with unwashed hands.
<br>All it proves is that Hector adamantly refused to pour
<br>libations to Zeus while his hands were drenched in human blood.
<br></P><P>
<br>If you merely read Homer, you'll have a hard time
<br>proving that there is such a prohibition without
<br>understanding a few things about Ancient Greece.
<br>This is my second rule for primary sources.
<br>You almost always need considerable background knowledge
<br>to evaluate primary sources.
<br>Certainly you cannot evaluate them efficiently without
<br>such knowledge.
<br></P><P>
<br>Probably the first thing to know is that Homer is consistent
<br>in his formulaic repetition of certain themes. This is so well
<br>known, it has a name: the Homeric Epithet. For example, whenever
<br>a warrior falls in battle, we hear the clanging of armor as he
<br>crashes to the ground. The washing is also formulaic, especially
<br>in <I>The Odyssey</I> where we read over and over
<br>"A maid servant then brought me water in a beautiful golden
<br>ewer and poured it into a silver basin for me to wash my hands, and
<br>she drew a clean table beside me".
<br>The servant, silver basin, washing, and drawing of a clean table
<br>all occur over and over again in nearly the exact same words.
<br></P><P>
<br>If you read <I>The Iliad</I> carefully you might
<br>notice that people only wash their hands before praying to or pouring
<br>libations to a deathless god, which essentially means the Olympians.
<br>You do not read about any required washing of hands
<br>before pouring libations to the dead, or to minor gods, 
<br>which they also did.
<br>Finally, you can read about Achilles pouring to
<br>Zephyr and Boreas (the west and north winds)
<br>and also pouring to his fallen friend Patroclus,
<br>while building Patroclus' funeral pyre,
<br>all the while refusing to wash off the blood of battle,
<br>Patroclus' blood, or the blood of the pyre sacrifices.
<br>He also refrains from the feast, thus getting
<br>out of the need to wash for the pouring to the deathless gods.
<br>If you want an explicit statement of the prohibition,
<br>you can find it in Hesiod
<br>[<I>Works and Days</I> II 724-6].
<br>But Hesiod lived after Homer, so this too proves nothing.
<br>But at this point, we have enough information to make
<br>a convincing argument.
<br></P><P>
<br>In every case in <I>The Iliad</I>,
<br>people wash their hands
<br>before pouring libations to the deathless gods.
<br>It is unlikely that Homer made this up and then went
<br>through the trouble of dragging out the servants with
<br>their water and napkins along with the wine
<br>every time the meal ended.
<br>(In one case the washing is not explicitly mentioned,
<br>but it is implied because the servants would not forget.)
<br>Hector's adamant stance makes it almost certain
<br>that Homer knew of a prohibition in some form.
<br>We can judge its precise form from the actions of
<br>Homer's characters. They washed their hands before pouring
<br>libations to a deathless god, but did not (necessarily) wash before
<br>pouring to the dead or to the minor gods and daemons.
<br>The explicit statement by Hesiod verifies that precisely
<br>such a prohibition did exist, if after Homer's time.
<br>This is precisely the form the prohibition took centuries later
<br>(barring some minor variations).
<br>Ritual is one of the most conservative of human activities.
<br>It is unthinkable that Homer could describe a prohibition
<br>so precisely and take such care to point it out in every case
<br>if the prohibition did not already exist in his day.
<br><I>The Odyssey</I> is an even more striking example
<br>of the consistent, formulaic repetition of this ritual.
<br></P>
<br><P><B>Evaluating the Results</B></P>
<br><P>Using the simplest approach to searching
<br>got me a single search result that contained
<br>enough information for me to solve most of the problem.
<br>I also needed to scan the actual primary source,
<br><I>The Iliad</I>, albeit in translation,
<br>and look up the book and line numbers
<br>in Hesiod's <I>Works and Days</I>
<br>where I knew beforehand the prohibition could be found.
<br>I knew enough of the subject to do the rest.
<br>You may have needed to do more work.
<br></P><P>
<br>If you're not familiar with Ancient Greece, you 
<br>need to first learn that Hesiod explicitly mentions the
<br>prohibition, or at least that this prohibition existed later.
<br>This could take some time, but is not a difficult problem.
<br>You might also have missed the extra point about not
<br>washing before pouring libations to the dead, a point
<br>that helps strengthen the argument.
<br>This is also extra work, but you'd have to be pretty sharp
<br>to catch it. In any case, it's not strictly necessary.
<br>If you're not familiar with history at all, you probably
<br>couldn't construct a proof.
<br>You might even be unconvinced of this proof or any other
<br>that falls short of irrefutable logic, causing you to
<br>expend untold extra work looking for unnecessary
<br>and difficult material, and probably failing in the end.
<br></P>
<br><P>This is exactly how a search should work.</P>
<br><P>Go back to the first two rules about primary sources.</P>
<br><UL>
<br><LI>You might need background knowledge to locate resources.</LI>
<br><LI>You almost always need considerable background knowledge to evaluate resources.</LI>
<br></UL>
<br><P>If you don't have the background, then you need to do some work to acquire it.
<br>I'd add that you tend to search for things that are near your level
<br>of knowledge and your subjects of interest.
<br>It's highly unlikely that anyone would search for information about
<br>a 2800 year old prohibition without some previous exposure to the subject.
<br>If you did find the need, you might be better off finding someone to help.
<br></P><P>
<br>But we need to answer the bottom line question.
<br>Was this search successful?
<br>No doubt it solved the problem for me.
<br>So for me, this was a successful search.
<br>For someone without the proper background,
<br>it is a miserable failure in more ways than I can count.
<br></P>
<br><P><B>Improving the Naive Approach</B></P>
<br><P>Someone suggested we change the query.
<br>Of course we have to do this.
<br>Let's try the obvious mechanical changes first.
<br></P>
<br><BLOCKQUOTE>
<br>A query like "unwashed hands" libations homer is just one facet of the quarry.
<br><BR>The quarry is more or less like a diamond, we need to turn it around :) 
<br><BR>The examples below are from google too. 
<br><BR>libations homer "washed hands": gives nada. 
<br><BR>libations homer "washed * hands": gives 37, and they look promising. 
<br><BR>libations homer "handwashing": 7
<br>(don't forget the variants: hand-washing, "hand washing") 
<br><BR>libations homer "wash hands": 1 
<br><BR>libations homer "wash * hands": 29 (&#33;) 
<br>then the same variations with "libation" in the singular.
<br><BR>Of course, you can achieve the same effect by designing a boolean string... 
<br><BR>Rephrasing in any conceivable way, using synonyms,
<br>changing the sequence of words, changing expressions, even changing the spelling,
<br>that's what I'd use if the first cast of the net brings too little. 
<br></BLOCKQUOTE>
<br><P>
<br>First things first.
<br>These techniques are essential.
<br>While translations of classics tend to use certain phrases,
<br>there's usually more than one set of phrases,
<br>and they vary by language.
<br>For example, you should try: wash, washed, washing, unwashed,
<br>unwashen, unclean, and maybe others.
<br>Notice the ancient language, especially unwashen.
<br>This is something peculiar to classics.
<br>But each area has its own peculiar language.
<br>You should find out and use the phrases that your targets use.
<br></P><P>
<br>I tried all of these suggestions on several search engines.
<br>and got as many as 600 results.
<br>One thing to note is that trying the same query a second time
<br>might give different result. This is normal.
<br>The results you get vary depending on the
<br>time of day, day of the month, how busy the servers are, etc.
<br></P><P>
<br>In all these results, there were only a handful of any relevance.
<br>If you're not familiar with the subject, you might not even spot them.
<br>It's pretty clear that more isn't necessarily better.
<br>Randomly playing with word order, word tense, and synonyms
<br>is important, but it only gets us so far.
<br>We need a better way.
<br></P>
<br><P><B>Abandoning the Naive Approach</B></P>
<br><P>The best way to improve our chances of finding something is to
<br>have the background knowledge needed to find it.
<br>We need even more knowledge to evaluate what we do find.
<br>Without this knowledge we might not recognize that
<br>something we run across is significant.
<br></P><P>
<br>The original document we found was relevant mostly because it
<br>pointed to <I>The Iliad</I>.
<br>(In fact, there's an interesting discussion about the translation
<br>that is quite relevant.)
<br>We would have been better off just finding that in the first place.
<br>Even if we found it, it isn't enough to answer the question.
<br>We need some background information to find the whole answer.
<br></P>
<br><P><B>Understand the Information</B></P>
<br><P>The first thing to do is understand what we're looking for.
<br>Let's go back to the original statement
<br>and consider what we need to know about it.</P>
<br><BLOCKQUOTE>The prohibition against pouring libations with unwashed hands is as old as Homer.
<br></BLOCKQUOTE>
<br><P>First, you should read an overview of what <I>The Iliad</I> is about.
<br>We already know it's important, since it came up in our original search.
<br>Then we need some background information.
<br></P>
<br><P><B>What are libations?</B></P>
<br><P>If you don't know, look it up.
<br>Since it looks like a thing that you can pour, you can even use a dictionary.
<br>Again, we use a very simple query for "libations" or maybe "libation".
<br>The dictionary says:</P>
<br><OL>
<br><LI>The act of pouring a liquid or liquor, usually wine, either on the ground
<br>    or on a victim in sacrifice, in honor of some deity;
<br>    also, the wine or liquid thus poured out.</LI>
<br><LI>a. A beverage, especially an alcoholic beverage.
<br><BR> b. An act or instance of drinking.</LI>
<br></OL>
<br><P>The original quote talks about pouring libations,
<br>so we can guess that the first definition is the right one.
<br></P>
<br><P><B>Who is Homer?</B></P>
<br><P>Let's get some background information on him.
<br>A simple search engine query for "homer" should get us what we need.
<br>For now, don't try to find anything connecting him to prohibitions or libations.
<br>At this stage, we only want some general background on him.
<br>This background will help us ask more intelligent questions later
<br>when we try again to find the connection.
<br></P><P>
<br>Homer was a poet in Ancient Greece.
<br>He's important because his version of the epic poetry was written down,
<br>probably around 850 BCE.
<br>The most important of his poems are the epic poems
<br><I>The Iliad</I> and <I>The Odyssey</I>.
<br>We're already familiar with one of those.
<br></P><P>
<br>So now we have the who (Homer), what (Iliad, Odyssey),
<br>where (Greece), and when (850 BCE).
<br>What about the why?
<br></P><P>
<br>For the why, we should probably ask if there's some significance
<br>to "as old as Homer".
<br>We might find out that Homer's work is the oldest Greek writing.
<br>This is significant because it makes it very difficult to find
<br>out if this prohibition existed before Homer.
<br></P><P>
<br>If we dig deeper, we might find out more.
<br>Homer's poems, along with Hesiod's work, form the basis of Greek religious thought.
<br>This is definitely significant, since what we're looking for
<br>is almost certainly a religious prohibition.
<br></P><P>
<br>At this point, you might want to get some background on Hesiod.
<br>The main things to learn are what he wrote, and that
<br>he lived about 100 years after Homer.
<br><P>
<br>Whatever you find out, you'll still need Homer's work for the proof.
<br>Once you learn this, you should repeat the original search using
<br>hesiod instead of homer.
<br>You should realize that your ultimate target is a primary source,
<br>a translation of Hesiod's writing, even if you need to read a few
<br>secondary sources along the way.
<br>(Remember to use the word variants, and more than one search engine, if necessary.)
<br>If you follow this path, you'll find the explicit mention of the prohibition in his
<br><I>Works and Days</I>.
<br></P>
<br><P><B>A Biased Detour</B></P>
<br><P>
<br>Unfortunately, some people claim that Hesiod came before Homer.
<br></P><P>
<br>On a simplistic level, you should never just believe the first
<br>or any source you read.
<br>The real problem is knowing when you've done enough.
<br>Just how much effort do you really want to expend?
<br>And how sure do you need to be?
<br>Unfortunately, more isn't necessarily better.
<br>You might still not have a good answer even after reading everything
<br>ever written on a subject.
<br>I'll refrain from getting philosophical here.
<br>Instead, it's probably a good idea to inject your own bias into the process.
<br>As the rest of this section points out, everything you read will
<br>be biased, so you may as well filter it through your own biases.
<br></P><P>
<br>Having more than one answer is actually a pretty complex problem
<br>because it operates on many different levels.
<br>It goes well beyond a mere
<br>dispute of the facts, or what we normally think of as bias.</P>
<br><BLOCKQUOTE>
<br>Some schools of thought believe that bias is an inherent
<br>part of what historians do.
<br>They go so far as to say that history is the study of historians.
<br></BLOCKQUOTE>
<br><P>I'll be blunt and make no excuses.
<br>In this case historical facts are irrelevant.
<br>There is a tradition that Homer comes first.
<br>On one level, "history is the study of historians" means
<br>accepting that Homer came first because most historians say so.
<br>Digging further means discovering how and why they reached those conclusions.
<br>In any case, Homer's work represents the bardic tradition--the
<br>early Greek mythos--which definitely preceeds both Homer and Hesiod.
<br>Call it a simplification if you like.
<br></P><P>
<br>Strict adherence to facts is only one method among many.
<br>There are different schools of thought among historians, and all but one
<br>or two of them reject the strict adherence to facts.
<br>This doesn't mean they dismiss facts, but rather they simplify and add theories.
<br>A good historian would point out the dispute, but might only do so by slipping
<br>a word or two into a sentence like "probably", or "by most accounts".
<br>Why bother with facts when what you really want is to understand?
<br>The dates of when these guys lived are raw facts.
<br>You can use them as is, and do nothing with them, except put them in a chronology.
<br>Or you can make use of the dates for very limited, specialized research.
<br>Even if it were proved that Hesiod came first,
<br>it would be deceptive to let that get in the way of a clear understanding
<br>that the lyric poetry in Homer predates both Homer and Hesiod.
<br></P><P>
<br>I asked before how much effort you want to put into the search.
<br>The answer, of course, depends on what you want to get out of it.
<br>If you're looking for some coherent background, you might be better served
<br>getting one biased version from a reliable source, kind of like the advice
<br>you get when you ask someone you trust.
<br>(See "Sielaff's lessons" on the "Evaluating results" page on searchlores.)
<br></P><P>
<br>Of course, that assumes the bias is appropriate.
<br>A particular point of view that's perfect for one use
<br>might be useless for another purpose.
<br>For example, there's a French school of the history of Greek religion
<br>(Zaidman and Pantel) that places everything within the context of the
<br>city-state. It's a very useful point of view to learn about the later
<br>developments when the large temples were erected.
<br>Unfortunately, it biases the entire discussion by placing the center
<br>of Greek life in the city, while its heart was always in the countryside.
<br>(Some historians even claim there never was a proper city in Greece.
<br>Greek life was about small communites, not great cities.)
<br>Also, by deemphasizing the earlier history (pre 5th C),
<br>the continuity as well as the early basis for the later crisis
<br>are completely missed.
<br>Contrast this with Nilsson whose focus on the countryside
<br>shows the continuty clearly--to the point that you can understand
<br>some things that are still with us--yet this emphasis makes it
<br>very hard to understand how any Greek could have accepted a
<br>nationalistic religion that brought about the empire and the
<br>grand temples, probably setting the pattern that Rome would
<br>later bring to new heights.
<br>Likewise, a proper (non-religious) history might cite the
<br>Persian wars as the cause for the empire, and it will probably
<br>explain the crisis clearly, and it will also be able to show
<br>continuity in some things from the latter part of the 5th century
<br>through today (Philosophy, Science, and maybe Democracy),
<br>but such an emphasis can too easily overshadow the more
<br>subtle continuity in folk religion and social life that
<br>dates back to at least the 9th century, if not the 15th--the
<br>continuity that Nilsson illustrates.
<br>(Greek religion is unusual in that it's not distinguished from civil
<br>life in general, unlike nearly every other great civilization.
<br>This makes it difficult to separate religion from any historical account.)
<br>These are all examples of bias.
<br>I hope the time I spent on them illustrates how different
<br>starting points can lead to different conclusions.
<br></P><P>
<br>Also, the level at which you want your information is something
<br>you need to consider as part of the preparation for any phase of
<br>a complex search, like this learning process approach to history searches.
<br>Do you really want to read linguistic analysis of ancient Greek, and
<br>arcane discussions about phrases and word comparisons?
<br>I sure don't.
<br>If a particular point interests you, then learn more about it.
<br>If the goal is just to get background on something to improve the later
<br>stages of the search, then even wrong answers can be useful.
<br>Does it really matter if you get incorrect directions that get you
<br>where you want to go?
<br>If it does matter, or if you're curious,
<br>then you just need to do more work. Or maybe it's play.
<br></P>
<br><P><B>Stop & Think</B></P>
<br><P>We're trying to find out if a prohibition existed in Homer's time.
<br>If we can prove that Homer knew about it, we're done.
<br>We're also done if we can prove that someone before Homer knew about it.
<br>Since noone in Greece wrote before him, that might be hard to prove.
<br>Or is it?
<br></P><P>
<br>Homer's epic poems are about the Trojan War. The heroes in it are people
<br>who lived in the area before it became known as Greece.
<br>With a little digging you should find out that there were two main
<br>cultures in the area, the Mycenaeans, and the Minoans.
<br>Since the Minoans are centered on the island of Crete,
<br>we should probably start with the Mycenaeans, who lived on the
<br>mainland of Greece.
<br>Did the Mycenaeans have writing?
<br></P><P>
<br>A quick search on "mycenaean writing" should yield results.
<br>Linear-B was a syllabary (a set of written symbols that represent syllables)
<br>used in Mycenae during the 14th and 13th centuries BCE.
<br>The language used was an early form of Greek.
<br>Linear-B is derived from Linear-A, used for writing by the Minoans,
<br>who had an entirely different language.
<br></P><P>
<br>Looking at the dates, we find that Linear-B is used in the 13th century,
<br>and writing doesn't occur again until the 8th or 9th century with Homer.
<br>This is why those years are called the dark age.
<br>This isn't very hopeful.
<br>If we can find the prohibition in Mycenaean times,
<br>we'd still have to show that it existed after Homer
<br>(the proof of which is in Hesiod, or in many books after Hesiod's time)
<br>and also that the practice was continuous.
<br>This wouldn't be easy.
<br>We already talked about how difficult it is to prove
<br>this kind of negative using artifacts.
<br>We should probably concentrate on using Homer to prove it.
<br></P><P>
<br>Grab a copy of <I>The Iliad</I> and search through it
<br>for libation or whatever word the translator uses.
<br>We have an advantage here in that the language within
<br>a single translation is almost certain to be consistent.
<br>A little gift we get in the case of Homer's poetry.
<br>He likes to reuse phrases, and any translator worth
<br>their salt will stick to this tradition.
<br>Unfortunately, this yields nothing.
<br>Search <I>The Odyssey</I> and you get the same result.
<br>There is no explicit mention of any prohibition in Homer.
<br></P><P>
<br>We should probably find out whether this prohibition existed at all.
<br>If we were lucky, we already found out about Hesiod,
<br>in which case we know the answer.
<br>There are some other things we might try to learn,
<br>some will prove useful, some won't.
<br>For example, if the prohibition did exist, we might try to
<br>find out when it started. (But we won't do this yet.)
<br></P><P>
<br>In any case, we need to find out about the prohibition.
<br>Back to the search engines.
<br></P>
<br><P><B>More Bad Search Results</B></P>
<br><P>We already know we're dealing with Greece, so let's search for
<br>"libation AND greece AND prohibition".
<br>A few queries to try are:</P>
<br><UL>
<br><LI>prohibition libation (greece OR greek)</LI>
<br><LI>prohibition libation hesiod</LI>
<br><LI>prohibition libation mycenaean</LI>
<br><LI>If you learned the other word forms:
<br>    prohibition libation (mycenae OR mycenaean OR mycene)</LI>
<br></UL>
<br>You might also try variations on the word prohibition.
<br>Unfortunately, we run into the same old problems.
<br>The results are probably filled with useless links.
<br>Let's forget about the prohibition and learn about the practice instead.
<br>This time we'll cast the net wider, drop the quotes on "unwashed hands",
<br>and use the simpler words [wash hands].
<br><UL>
<br><LI>wash hands libation (greece OR greek)</LI>
<br><LI>wash hands libation hesiod</LI>
<br><LI>wash hands libation mycenaean</LI>
<br><LI>If you learned the other word forms:
<br>    wash hands libation (mycenae OR mycenaean OR mycene)</LI>
<br></UL>
<br><P>
<br>Not very successful. In fact, it's getting worse.
<br>We've just bumped into three rules of internet searches:</P>
<br><BLOCKQUOTE>Search engines are dumb.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<br>There has to be a better way than to wade through hundreds
<br>of links trying to find the few relevant ones.
<br><BLOCKQUOTE>The caveat about bias in secondary sources applies
<br>especially on the internet where misrepresentation and
<br>deceit are the rule, not the exception.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<br>
<br><P>You'll probably notice by now that there's a lot of stuff on the
<br>internet related to modern pagan cults.
<br>These are modern people who practice the ancient Greek religions.
<br>The subject is very close to the one we're interested in.
<br>Almost all of the words we use in any query are going to bring
<br>results from this group.
<br>For now, if you realize it's a modern cult, run away.
<br>This has nothing to do with being a cult,
<br>it's just that, for the most part, they are a very bad
<br>source of information on the real ancient Greek religions.
<br>Another large problem area are Christian sources that try
<br>to either discredit Greek religions, or highlight them
<br>in a positive way. The purpose of both of these is to
<br>bolster the validity of modern ideas.
<br>Either way, most, but certainly not all of these sources
<br>give a distorted point of view when your purpose is to
<br>learn about the actual Greek religions.</P>
<br><BLOCKQUOTE>History isn't exactly a popular subject, but some of the
<br>issues you deal with are. Sometimes, a more popular treatment
<br>can hide the stuff you're interested in. If this happens with your subject
<br>it can be hard to get past the more popular stuff to
<br>the things that interest you.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<br><P>Anything to do with Ancient Greek religion
<br>is hidden behind the more popular subjects of modern cults
<br>and Christian apologists.
<br>It would be nice to have a better way to get past the
<br>stuff we don't want.
<br></P>
<br><P><B>Going Further</B></P>
<br><P>
<br>There's no real point in discussing more about choosing different
<br>words for search engines because the arrows that hit the targets,
<br>and the results you get vary so much depending on what you're looking for.
<br>If you need ideas, there's a lot of good stuff on searchlores.
<br>I only went through a few of the simpler techniques to
<br>highlight some of the problems that are specific to history.
<br>The real issues are all about evaluating the material
<br>and asking the right questions to find the next piece of the puzzle.
<br></P><P>
<br>If you're interested in taking the research further,
<br>try a picture search to learn what you can from before Homer's time.
<br>Another approach is to compare the practice of different cultures.
<br>If you're brave, you might even look further for the prohibition,
<br>but I'm not that brave.
<br>Or, you could just keep plugging at the written material from
<br>later Greece to follow how the practice changed.
<br>Just don't get too sidetracked.
<br>Also, you might want to look back at the list of difficulties
<br>and see what you disagree with, and what solutions you have.
<br></P><P>
<br>In the end, I find the internet very useful to get
<br>an overview of related issues, or to get background on something,
<br>or even to find out which sources to use off the internet.
<br>I'm constantly looking things up while reading books, especially
<br>on a new subject.
<br>Some useful general tools you might want to bookmark are picture
<br>dictionaries and a thesaurus for terms in archaeology, art,
<br>architecture, geography, geology,
<br>and then some maps and general timelines for the areas and time
<br>periods you're studying and those nearby.
<br>But I believe you still need a good library to do serious research.
<br>The internet just isn't up to serious historical research yet,
<br>except for a few, mostly recent topics.
<br>The situation is constantly improving for primary sources,
<br>but I think the lack of good secondary sources is going
<br>to remain a problem for quite a while. I hope I'm wrong.
<br></P><P>
<br>Unfortunately, at this point I have more questions than answers.
<br>Someone said "I may not get my answer - but learn a lot of History".
<br>If the article helped get the critical thinking process going,
<br>it did its job.
