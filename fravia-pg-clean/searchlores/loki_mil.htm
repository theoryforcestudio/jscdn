(About the careless spreading of 
field manuals and other military documentation on the web)

<hr>

This essay is important <i>per se</i> and as an example of the
sheer power that knowing how to
search can put at your fingertips. Of course the examples given
below are to be taken
(and used)    <i>cum grano salis</i>, but I am sure capable
readers will be able to
'improvise' on similar, <a href="synecdoc.htm">synecdochical</a>
paths... Note also how even seasoned seekers can still find some 
incredible surprises on the web. Human idiocy being known since 
the dawn of history, it should not wonder you to find 
manuals like  <a href="zipped/46_1.pdf">this one</a>

("<font color=blue>the keystone doctrinal manual
for U.S. Army Public Affairs operations...describes the fundamental
principles and concepts for providing information
to a wide range of internal and external audiences
– soldiers, family members, retirees, political
leaders, the general public, allies and adversaries</font>"), all 
over the web. <br>
Enjoy!

<br>First of all, let's clarify something : we are not working "FOR"
anybody,
we are not doing anything for money, hence we are not "professionals",
we are just harmless (dangerous) fools :) (aha... only in part serious...)
<br>As for 'me', i am one of 'we', i'm a fool who has a hobby
for fields related to intelligence, and for playing with
(key)words. About the stuff listed there, i've not (yet) read even 0.1%
of it, but
i think that doesn't mean i can't process and evaluate the 
information i am able to find.
<br>Anyway i sincerely hope the documents you'll find 
using the tecniques explained in this essay will be of some use for 
students, researchers, game masters in need of inspiration, whatever...
<br>
<br>The first time i've hit a military field manual, it was the
<u>Psychological Operations</u> manual, which has the reference <a
target=_top
href="zipped/psyop.zip">FM
33-1-1</a> (<i>you'll be able to find it on the web, here a local copy just to give you 
an exact idea of what we are discussing here</i>).
<br>Such an easy to figure classification made me thought of a way
to fish the whole collection, and moreover, as the presence of the
psyop manual in the open source web (the
indexed, not hidden and not unlinked part of the web) shows, some
of them are said to be of 'restricted access'. Check <a
target=_top
href="http://www.adtdl.army.mil/cgi-bin/atdl.dll/query/download/FM
+33-1-1">this official .mil site</a> for confirmation. Try to
download
some part of the manual..
<br>
<br>Here are some of the most useful site i've bookmarked during my searches,
and i know they have less value than some gems that still await to be found in 
this funny field :)
<br>
<br><center><a target=_top
href="http://66.200.6.11/army-mans/">http://66.200.6.11/army-mans/
</a>
<br><a target=_top
href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/f
m/">http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/
</a></center>
<br>
<br>I think there are more than 2 Go of field manuals and other
military documentations in  the urls given above (including the <a
target=_top href="http://www.geocities.com/mrostov8/ ">FM
33-1-1</a> we saw above). 
<br><br>
If you do take <u>a close look</u> there, you'll find again and again 
some restricted documents, not
yet unclassified. So what? Do you really believe 'they', also the
services "specialized" in information management, ignore that? Are they klebing 
us on the web? It's a kind of <a href="trolls.htm">huge trolling operation</a>? 
Am i
being too parano&iuml;d? The juicy stuff should be on <a
target=_top
href="http://www.google.com/search?q=SIPRNET">SIPRNET</a>
in my humble opinion. And if they aren't aware of this lost of
secret informations, i eat my mouse, with the wire. But anyway
those documents, even if "restricted", are now quite unrestricted, 
opened like dead shells, thanks to all s.e. crawlers and spiders :)
<br><br>In order to read them you don't even have to visit (and 
surely you do  not need to break inside) a .mil site! You don't
even have to use proxies, nor proxy chaining bazaars! 
Just use google's cache and you will consult the
manuals remaining  fully anonymous for the .mil sites (and if you do 
not trust google cache either, just find one of the 1000 copies of your target 
that have already been stored on those pesky private 'homepages'  
that blossom all over the web :-)
<br><br>This said, i noticed  that the number of "restricted
documents" in open source information are decreasing over time inside the 
indexes of the search engines (creeping censorship?). 
<br><br>So,
if you have a good connection, and a good list of <a href="proxy.htm">proxies</a>, please,
by all mean, download everything you can... and mirror everything on some
pages, wich you'll  later get indexed by the search engines (and should google, for some reason, 
"disdain" such indexing, he'll get for sure some "real" competition by the older 
search engines: commercial search engines' bickering helps freedom of expression! :-)

<br>
<br>
<br>Let me give you my 'stratagems' to fish such documents
quickly. I believe more useful to KNOW that these
documents exist, and that one is able to fish them with a simple
search engine, than just
to distribute such files in a 10 Go package. Distribution is always 
stale per definition. Moreover such "knowledge approaches" do not have the same 
legal consequences :)
<br>
<br><center>~</center>
<br>
<br>One of the first queries i made was this one : <font
color="blue">+filetype:pdf +"DISTRIBUTION RESTRICTION"
-unlimited</font>. Here <a href="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=%2Bfiletype%3Apdf+%2B%22DISTRIBUTION+RESTRICTION%22&num=10&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&btnG=Google+Search&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&lr=&as_ft=i&as_filetype=&as_qdr=all&as_occt=any&as_dt=i&as_sitesearch=&safe=images">it is</a>.
<br>
<br>Note that the <font color="blue">filetype:pdf</font> option,
that asks to give only results of pdf type, only works with
some search engines (for instance google). These engines 
can also search INSIDE powerpoint slides
(<font color="blue">filetype:ppt</font>) word documents (<font
color="blue">filetype:doc</font>), excell sheets (<font
color="blue">filetype:xls</font>) and also poscript file (<font
color="blue">filetype:ps</font>).<br>
<br>A nice feature, if you realize that "military users" (as well as 
bureaucrats and zombies) simpky <b>love</B> those 
pesky microsoft and adobe formats (i'm not talking
of poscript). 
<br><br>
Test <font color="blue">"filetype:ppt
site:.mil"</font> on <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&as_qdr=all&q=filetype%3Appt+site%3A.mil&btnG=Google+Search">google</a> : 41.600
 (my time, my
home).
<br>Moreover, as i said earlier, google offers the opportunity to
view the <font color=blue>cache</font> of the target pages, 
and moreover converts pdf files into
html. Nothing to install, not many traces left behind.
<br>
<br><font color="blue">"DISTRIBUTION RESTRICTION"</font> are
common keywords on military documents, generally followed by the
type of restriction that applies to the current document. Therefore,
filtering with <font color="blue">-unlimited</font> should reduce the
results to (only) "limited distribution stuff". (<I>I am sure ~S~ Jeff will soon 
experiment on this</i>)<br>
<br>What about the field manual FM-46-2 <u>Unlimited control
of the world. We are the borg, you will be assimilated</u>? ;)
<br>Dig in the results, there are things like "Distribution
Restriction : NONE". And now, how're yu supposed to filter <b>that</b>? <font
color="blue">-none</font> is totally unthinkable for obvious
reasons.
<br>Finally 290 hits, for this 'advanced' (using the <a href="http://www.google.com/advanced_search">advanced 
feature</a> 
of google) <a
href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%2Bfiletype%3Apdf+%2B%22DISTR
IBUTION+RESTRICTION%22+-unlimited">query</a>.. should even only a meager 10% 
of the results point to "restricted documents", that means a lotta files nevertheless, and
hence a lotta sites that '<font color=blue>potentially</font>' offer 
more results of that type of data for those that have learned the simplest 'ways' 
of searching :-)
<br>
<br><center>~</center>
<br>One can build variations on such a query, in order to generate
a  more consequent information environment.
<br><br>For instance: <font color=""blue"">(filetype:pdf OR filetype:doc OR
filetype:ppt) AND "DISTRIBUTION RESTRICTION' -unlimited</font>
<br>
<br>Even simplier : <font color=""blue"">+"DISTRIBUTION
RESTRICTION: Distribution is authorized to" </font>
<br>Observing the 'template' of the field manuals, and especially those used in
those pesky "restricted distribution documents", one can exctract a group of
(key)words that will litterally CUT through the web pudding. This
is a quite intuitive method, pointed out by ~S~ fravia+ 
in his '<a target=_top
href="http://www.searchlores.org/synecdoc.htm">synecdochical</a>'   approach.
<br>
<br>Let's take  as our model the (<u>Mine/Countermine
Operations</u>) FM, that you, by now, should be able to find on your own.
<br>
<br>Suppose that this portion/box/snippet appears ALSO on the majority of all 
"Field Manuals" :
<br>
<center><pre><font size=+1>
----------------------------------------------------------------
DISTRIBUTION RESTRICTION
                           
Distribution authorized to US Government agencies only to protect
technical or operational information from automatic dissemination
under the International Exchange program or by other means. This
determination was made on 1 July 1992. Other requests for this
document will be referred to Commandant, US Army Engineer School,
ATTN: ATSE-TDM-P, Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri 65473-6650.
  
[ 8< ]

DESTRUCTION NOTICE
                             
Destroy by any method that will prevent disclosure of contents
or reconstruction of the document
-----------------------------------------------------------------
</font></pre></center>
<br>Wich is quite different from "DISTRIBUTION RESTRICTION:
Approved for public release; distribution is unlimited."
<br>
<br><font color="blue">"DISTRIBUTION RESTRICTION: Distribution
is authorized to"</font> should result into a great filter in order 
to remove 
web noise. The whole pack inside one single sentence. The fished documents
will probably be military documents, <u>not approved</u> for public
release, since their "distribution is authorized to"    (only) 
someone/somegroup.. Quite a simple query, and a powerful one as well (we may imagine 
many other fields where we would be able to apply a similar searching trick :)
<br>
<br>Even more powerfull, and funnier : Search for documents saying
<b><font color=blue>that they should be destroyed</font></b>, by any method. fnord!
<br>Isn't that a bit <i>magical</i> ? :)
<br>
<br><font color=""blue"">"Destroy by any method that will prevent
disclosure of contents or reconstruction of the document"</font> :
<a
href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Destroy+by+any+method+that
+will+prevent+disclosure+of+contents+or+reconstruction+of+the+docu
ment%22">252 hits</a> on google... not even FM centered this time :)
<br>

<br>
<br>Most of the information isn't really hidden. It's there, not
so far from us, but under a ton of noisy, unrelated, data. The
major difficulty you face while hunting data is not of technical
type, but is more cognitive. You are limited by your IMAGINATION.
<br>I hope you'll find these stratagems (or rather strata - gems) somewhat interesting, and
we hope you will contribute by sending as feedback OTHER 
good urls, queries, or documentation (with a description of
the way you used to find them).
<br>
<br>Ah.
<br>
<br>To conlude.
<br>It's like the Ocean, hu: Sometime, the web can be a little bit scaring, and sometime
really beautiful. It's like the Mountains, hu&nbsp;:) 
<br><br>
During the writing of this article, i've found
something enlightening : "a wild flower surrounded by metal fences".    I would like 
to offer it to you. 
<br>Perform the <a
href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Destroy+by+any+method+that
+will+prevent+disclosure+of+contents+or+reconstruction+of+the+docu
ment%22">query</a> seen earlier, and check the result #19, aha.
