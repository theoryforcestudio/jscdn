<br>
<br>How to get to newsgroups...
<br>
<br>Newsgroups aren't distributed from a central place, but handed on from server to server, i.e. the messages distribute to other news servers on the net similar to a wave on a pool. They eventually appear, and they appear the faster the closer they are to the source. Ther are many news sources, so that we may receive lots of messages in a short time. If you send a message, it might take it some days until you find it on all servers on the net. That's due to the decentral layout of the usenet, as explained.  
<br>Sometimes people send messages in parts, because they don't have enough bandwidth or time to post them as a whole. In case such a transfer is interrupted, it might happen that "multipart/binaries" parts of a message aren't complete. The larger a message and tzhe more parts it has the greater the chance that it is broken. 
<br>
<br>Not every newsgroup can be read using any newsserver, because usually when a server hands out a list of available groups to another server, it also filters some - for different reasons. Boards with extreme content or boards with huge amounts of data are likely to be filtered out. The providers try to prevent penalties for distributing illegal content, and high bandwidth costs lots of money. In fact, most providers offer only a preselected share out of the wealth of existing groups.
<br>
<br>Any more questions ? Try on usenet or read <a href="http://www.geocities.com/ResearchTriangle/Lab/1131/ua.htm">this faq</a> (a bit outdated) or better <a href="http://newssearch.pilum.net/faq.php">this one</a>.
<br>
<br>So, what to do if you would like to get to a specific newsgroup that your provider does not make available ? Well, the first thing to do is to find a newsserver which does mirror the group in question.
<br>
<br>(1)
<br>Just try all public newsservers on all lists you can get hands on... (a bit tedious, perhaps...)
<br>http://www.premium-news.com/list01.htm
<br>http://www.premium-news.com/list02.htm
<br>http://www.premium-news.com/list03.htm
<br>http://nlist.virtualave.net/
<br>http://www.newsserverguide.de/listen.htm
<br>http://www.newsserverguide.de/hersteller.htm
<br>http://www.newzbot.com/
<br>
<br>You may for certain reasons choose to register with one of the following two free newsservers:
<br>https://secure.mailgate.org/subscribe
<br>http://news.cis.dfn.de/de/register.html
<br>
<br>web interfaces:
<br>http://groups.google.com
<br>http://www.mailgate.org/index.html
<br>http://netnews.web.de/
<br>
<br>
<br>(2) Click yourself once around the <a href="http://nav.webring.yahoo.com/hub?ring=nntp">freenntp webring</a>
<br>
<br>(3) 
<br>Ask the oracle: Use the <a href="http://www.robotwisdom.com/finder/index.html">Robot Wisdom Newsgroup-Finder</a>
<br>You also get direct links to the group faqs - nice... 
<br>
<br>(4)
<br>Or you could use the html form at <a href="http://ip-service.com/IP/newsserv.htm">ip-service.com/IP/newsserv.htm</a> to check if a certain group is available via one of the listed NNTP servers. 
<br>Also check <a href="http://www.newzbot.com/search.html">newzbot</a> 
<br>and <a href="http://newssearch.pilum.net/index2.php">NewsSearch</a>. 
<br>
<br>(5)
<br>You might want to try the newsgroups search engine <a href="http://www.findolin.com/">Findolin</a>. Findolin had started out as muenz.com in 1996 and was rerlaunched under the new name in early 2001.
<br>
<br>~
<br>
<br>A list of pretty many existing newsgroups can be found at http://www.premium-news.com/groupsa.htm. See links under "Liste der Newsgroups".
