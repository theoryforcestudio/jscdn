The Ochre Riddle

<b>The task</b><br></center>
You will find the complete challenge in the following page: 
<br>
an ochre colored "image searching" <a href="whatis03.htm">riddle</a> (and challenge)
<br><bR>
Basically, the task was to find out what the following images represents:
<br>
<IMG SRC= "images/whatis03.jpg" 
  ALT= "Petit image"
  ALIGN= BOTTOM WIDTH= "518" HEIGHT= "351" BORDER= 0 VSPACE= 0
  HSPACE= 0>
<br>
<br>
Since 
Jeff found the solution very quickly...  
<hR>
<prE>
...after reading in the dictionary the several meanings for 
the word ochre,  i would at first guess that the man is 
crushing 'ore' clay for producing ochre powder 
however the tool seems rather small and light for that 
so i am probably  wrong -- but as i say-- it was my first 
20 seconds of visualization; 
will read some more about manual crushing later to see 
what track i might take in evaluating that image...

<hR>
...I feared that the riddle was too simple
for our 'community' of capable seekers.
<bR>
But other seekers <a href="http://fravia.2113.ch/phplab/mbs.php3/mb001?num=-1&thread=1051995111#1051995111">went 
astray</a>, until RA solved it. Here follows his solution:

<pre>The Ochre Riddle - Solution
****************************

The image is somewhat deceptive here. It looks interesting and 
unique. So I felt that the key to the riddle is in the image. 
Like most others initially I concentrated on it and largely 
ignored the surrounding text. by looking at the image, following 
comes to the mind:
1) some agricultural activity
2) possibly for a crop that needs to be grown indoors/needs 
   controlled sunlight
3) some kind of rare/interesting crop worthy of being put on a 
   postcard
4) asian fellow, doing hard labour

Most of these point nowhere and nothing similar is found. 
Nevertheless some good learning on diverse topics. 

Seems like I am missing something. 

When I looked at the surrounding text, the phrase &quot;ochre 
colored&quot; appears thrice. 
So it looks like some kind of clue (like Jeff said it jumps 
out of the page. ). 
Actually I had never really heard/used the word &quot;ochre&quot; 
before. From the usage on the riddle page and the color of the 
image, i had concluded earlier that it must be some shade of 
yellow. But then I felt like finding the exact meaning of the 
word. So I tried webster:

<A HREF="http://www.webster.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=dictionary&va=ochre" TARGET="_blank"><FONT CLASS="message-text-plain-http-link">http://www.webster.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&amp;va=ochre</FONT></A>

Main Entry: ocher 
Variant(s): or ochre  /'O-k&amp;r/
Function: noun
Etymology: Middle English oker, from Middle French ocre, from 
Latin ochra, from Greek Ochra, from feminine of Ochros yellow
Date: 14th century
1 : an earthy usually red or yellow and often impure iron ore 
    used as a pigment
2 : the color of ocher; especially : the color of yellow ocher

Since the tool that the person is using looks ancient/old-fashioned/
traditional and the setting and the general feel is also like 
old-times, I decide to concentrate on etymology of the word, 
thinking that if some ancient activity is depicted then it will 
most likely be called by its original name.

English &quot;Oker&quot;:
Websearch on Google leads to all sorts of sites &quot;ochre 
records&quot; etc.
Decide to do google image search. Tried all combinations of 
Oker, Ochre, England, UK. Few interesting links but nothing 
significant.  

France &quot;Ocre&quot;: 
Image search for : ocre France : nothing
 Image search for : ochre France
(<A HREF="http://images.google.com/images%3Fhl%3Den%26lr%3D%26ie%3DUTF-8%26oe%3DUTF-8%26q%3Dochre%2Bfrance" TARGET="_blank"><FONT CLASS="message-text-plain-http-link">http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=ochre+france</FONT></A>)
: 2 Interesting Images <font size=-1>
1) <A HREF="http://sasik.sasprg.cz/~stoupa/wallpaper/evropa/francie/Shades%20of%20Ochre,%20France.jpg" TARGET="_blank"><FONT CLASS="message-text-plain-http-link">http://sasik.sasprg.cz/~stoupa/wallpaper/evropa/francie/Shades%20of%20Ochre,%20France.jpg</FONT></A>
2) <A HREF="http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/~workman/pictures/france/tara_and_me.jpg" TARGET="_blank"><FONT CLASS="message-text-plain-http-link">http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/~workman/pictures/france/tara_and_me.jpg</FONT></A> 
</font>
On visiting these pages, I find that the first one is like a 
wallpapers page. 
But on the page <A HREF="http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/~workman/pictures/france/france.html" TARGET="_blank"><FONT CLASS="message-text-plain-http-link">http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/~workman/pictures/france/france.html</FONT></A> 
the text below the 2nd image says &quot;Tara and I at the ochre 
mine in Rousillon&quot;

Now &quot;Mine&quot; seems interesting lead.

So I decide to do a websearch for ochre+france+extraction:
<A HREF="http://www.google.com/search%3Fhl%3Den%26lr%3D%26ie%3DUTF-8%26oe%3DUTF-8%26q%3Dochre%2Bfrance%2Bextraction%26btnG%3DGoogle%2BSearch" TARGET="_blank"><FONT CLASS="message-text-plain-http-link">q=ochre+france+extraction&amp;btnG=Google+Search</FONT></A>
It leads to:
<A HREF="http://www.provenceguide.com/gbcdt/ocre.htm" TARGET="_blank"><FONT CLASS="message-text-plain-http-link">http://www.provenceguide.com/gbcdt/ocre.htm</FONT></A>
<A HREF="http://www.provenceguide.com/gbcdt/baocre.htm" TARGET="_blank"><FONT CLASS="message-text-plain-http-link">http://www.provenceguide.com/gbcdt/baocre.htm</FONT></A>

the text on ocre.htm describes the process and at the end mentions 
&quot;A Former Ochre Factory has been Rehabilitated&quot; - 
the description seems worthy of further examination.

baocre.htm gives the address of last ochre factory:

&quot;To know more about the ochre extraction and production techniques, 
visit the last ochre factory in Europe: 
  
Paul GUIGOU 
Les Ocres de France 
84400 APT 
Tel. 04.90.74.63.82 &quot;


last ochre factory (some kind of rarity) : Images from it can be 
put on a postcard!

so I try to look for a website of it - websearch of Ocres de 
france on google
<A HREF="http://www.google.com/search%3Fhl%3Den%26lr%3D%26ie%3DUTF-8%26oe%3DUTF-8%26q%3Docres%2Bde%2Bfrance" TARGET="_blank"><FONT CLASS="message-text-plain-http-link">http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=ocres+de+france</FONT></A>

and the 1st link is <A HREF="http://www.ocres-de-france.com" TARGET="_blank"><FONT CLASS="message-text-plain-http-link">http://www.ocres-de-france.com/</FONT></A>

(search for ocre+france also leads there:
<A HREF="http://www.google.com/search%3Fhl%3Den%26lr%3D%26ie%3DUTF-8%26oe%3DUTF-8%26q%3Docre%2Bfrance" TARGET="_blank"><FONT CLASS="message-text-plain-http-link">http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=ocre+france</FONT></A>)

looking at the image on the index page i feel like I have 
got it. I read thru the processing related page 
(<A HREF="http://www.ocres-de-france.com/uk/fabrication.htm" TARGET="_blank"><FONT CLASS="message-text-plain-http-link">http://www.ocres-de-france.com/uk/fabrication.htm</FONT></A>)
at the botton there is a link to photo gallery (7 images in all).                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
A look at the 7th image : <A HREF="http://www.ocres-de-france.com/images/usine.jpg" TARGET="_blank"><FONT CLASS="message-text-plain-http-link">http://www.ocres-de-france.com/images/usine.jpg</FONT></A> 
and there is no doubt.
(similar kind of lighting and a person wearing the same 
dress!)
