... are you willing to invest a little time to dig deeper than superficial?
<br>
<br>what i mean is, i am not going to go find you all of these articles--- but i am willing to show you how to find a few, so that you can in the future help yourself, and others, when they need help, and in so doing maybe find some old or new tricks. Like the old days of fixing broken programs ... what have you done so far? and where are you stuck at in your thought process?
<br>
<br>?
<br>
<br>its up to you and your time investment.
<br>
<br>i think it terrible the cost of education these days ... like being charged 500 dollars for an asprin in the hospital... pisses me off.
<br>
<br>if you will be willing to work side by side, i, or, we, will walk you thru a couple and we will see if the articles, individualy, are there... or maybe not :)
<br>
<br>what say you? 
<br>
<br>i can tell you right now the very first one i searched, and the very first link in google, produced one of your articles.

</td></tr><tr><td><ul>
Well... I've been a constant lurker of searchlores, but have not too often required using deep search techniques to find what I want.
<br>
<br>So far I've tried the articles names in quotations at google, the 
<br>"index +of" trick and some light combing.  The latter having been the most
<br>successful.  I have yet to try regional searching and some of the phplab scrolls,  although they don't seem to be working.
<br>
<br>I was wondering if there were any specific techniques for searching articles?
<br>In my mind, what is popular today is the database techniques.  Articles(such as these)are often stored in databases which offer them for a fee to customers.
<br>As an example I remeber Northern light of old.
<br>
<br>Hence I believe I will have an excellent success rate, by finding which journals or magazines will have the articles in them.
<br>
<br>In my searching style I like to automate the process as much as possible. So if I could write a bot, and narrow down the results as best as possible I believe to learn the most.  
<br>
<br>Hence, I would really appreciate help in building a search string that could be used specifically for finding articles.
<br>
<br>Cheers,

gottah leave in an hour too :(
<br>
<br>from reading your post it doesn't seem you need alot of help. You have good instincts.
<br>
<br>i think i jumped the gun again yesterday (not knowing your subject or book CONTENTS) it looks like what i found were abstracts (which are GREAT for Frodo searching [text searching] http://www.searchlores.org/targets.htm#text :) btw f+ webbits link gives rabbit 404-- it needs to say rabbit<b>s</b>.htm)
<br>
<br>as i said; i thought after searching for a few of your articles that i was seeing them come up in search all together, or very close together --- they felt familiar having just seen them.
<br>so i pasted <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&safe=off&q=Putnam%2C+%22Brains+and+Behavior%22+Place%2C+%22Is+Consciousness+a+Brain+Process%3F%22+Smart%2C+%22SensATIONS+AND+bRAIN+pROCESSES%22&btnG=Google+Search">several of the Titles in at a time</a> which gives the quester an idea sometimes of where the requester is coming from, or has been, or, needs to go :)
<br>
<br>looking at googles first link we see that a david chalmers indicates that he has put together <a href="http://www.u.arizona.edu/~chalmers/pom.html">an anthology of articles</a> (all of your articles) into a book called "Philosophy of Mind: Classical and Contemporary Readings, published by Oxford University Press.
<br>
<br>in this case it seems to be a well known layed out outline for many philosophy classes reading/s.
<br>
<br>seeing that all articles are in one book (rather than searching 10 articles) looked like the way to go...
<br>
<br>when pasting in the complete title usualy gona get hundreds of book/stores...
<br>I usualy do NOT -eliminate book sellers right away, because sometimes they have <b>excerpts</b> of TEXT of the book being sought... text can of course be the direct way to find those peoples who have put the book online and thus filter out all of the useless/camoflaged/ Title returns.
<br>
<br>some keywords to keep in mind while looking for author-title etc could be
<br>abstract/s citation/s excerpt/s review/s  ... because these may give you a paragraph of book contents; or author <i>quotes</i>.
<br>
<br>anyone with the book probly is not going to have named it Philosophy of Mind: Classical and Contemporary Readings.txt, but i do search in layers anyway... txt, pdf, rtf, doc, ascii, etc........... problem is what did the person name that damed long ass file Title...
<br>
<br>when easy searching keeps getting harder and harder thats when i then pretty much know its time to goto Librarys, university, journals, databases , etc...
<br>
<br>my readings tell me the chalmers book Is in universitys, in fact its probably at your local public library, and the articles themselves are in (seem to be said to be)in journals... this is not to say they aren't on the free net; haven't had time to exhaust possibilities though. 
<br>
<br>i am a terrible essay writer; terrible teacher (and do not profess to be one either and an even worse student&#33;&#33;:) so try to go beyond my writting and figure out what it is i try to say that i never quite get said corrctly, cause what i said is probably not what you heard :) :)
<br>
<br>anyway i only have a couple of minutes and gottah goto town
<br>
<br>:( try different keywords like:
<br>................ searle  "chapter"  ... to see what i mean when i jumped the gun.
<br>
<br>all info is valuable though even when you up the creek with the wrong paddle --- you soon see if you follow the searle "chapter" path that searle wrote:
<br>
<br>The Chinese Room
<br>John Searle, ?Minds, Brains and Programs?, The Behavioural and Brain Sciences volume 3 (1980), pp. 417-24; 
<br>also Minds, Brains and Science (Penguin, 1984), chapter 2 ?Can Computers Think??
<br>
<br>...so now we know that chalmers book has it; and that chapter 2 "can computers think?" was a RE-write in a book called "Minds, Brains and Science" ... now we have another lead ... and i have to leave and haven't helped at all :)

Excellent way to put it. Especially this:
<br>
<br>&gt;I usualy do NOT -eliminate book sellers right away, because sometimes they have 
<br>&gt;excerpts of TEXT of the book being sought... text can of course be the direct 
<br>&gt;way to find those peoples who have put the book online and thus filter out all 
<br>&gt;of the useless/camoflaged/ Title returns. 
<br>
<br>Use it on Searle and you get the original paper, the 1980 one - see two examples below:
<br>
<br>http://www.bbsonline.org/documents/a/00/00/04/84/bbs00000484-00/bbs.searle2.html
<br>http://home.hanmir.com/~prolog/ai/mind.html
<br>
<br>Of course, using this approach for each and every one of the articles is time-consuming. The optimal solution is to try to find the book.
<br>
<br>Another approach is to use a library card ID to enter one of the many libraries that allow online access. All you need is a number (14-digit or bar code of whatever). You can either use your own, or find one, or, if you're not in the US but have a (student) friend there, just ask him or her to give you a number.
<br>
<br>Universities also have free access to databases of science and research articles, but this only works through their proxy.

<br>
<br>e-yea-yah ... spelling can be an obscurity to that first or last click of hope :)
<br>
<br>often if we are looking for a book, we have no idea what the text is inside; so was trying to lay a tiny foundation to go further than "Title" in order to find text... finding will depend on your keywords of course.
<br>
<br>if you search:
<br>Hilary Putnam, "Brains and Behavior"  ...55 returns
<br>
<br>you will get an entirely different return than:
<br>
<br>Putnam "Brains and Behavior" ... 163 returns
<br>
<br>I generaly think less is better because one is specific, while the other allows stemming, if you see what i mean (for lack of a better vocabulary )
<br>
<br>in other words Putnam links to brains, while filtering drugs and joe blow out, meanwhile catching Hilary putnam, and H. Putnam, and Putnam --- whereas Hilary Putnam only cathes Hilary. (note i am not sure of the single word returns in pdf's because most of time i can not open them because my system crashs)
<br>
<br>it's like asking for philosphy and never seeing philosophiae or bevaviour :)
<br>
<br>using the word "chapter"/author-name/ might be one way to stumble upon online text, as well as other minor examples given.
<br>
<br>we discovered that your articles are in chalmers book in whole; 
<br>we know that one article "can computers think?" is in chapter 2 of searles "minds brains and science" 
<br>(note Not,i think, in Minds brains and Programs)
<br>see: http://www.cl-ki.uni-osnabrueck.de/~pbosch/FCS/Lentzen.pdf
<br>(which opened YEA&#33;)... now if i could only get hippias search to work :(
<br>
<br>so we can also now look for those two books, as mentioned.
<br>But if people can compile elliot, and chalmers can compile many authors, then it seems that others are entitled.
<br>
<br>so other than universities, journals, seperate articles, etc,,... which can come later, or will come later if not found ... how to keep getting <i>deeper</i>?
<br>
<br>what else might one visualize on a page? How about <a href="http://www.isbn.nu/toc/019514581X">"table of contents"</a>?
<br>
<br>i'm having trouble finding chalmers book <a href="http://66.218.71.225/search/cache?p=Putnam+%22Brains+and+Behavior%22+&ei=UTF-8&n=20&fl=0&url=QpPp5II3idQJ:www.ruf.rice.edu/~margolis/teaching/phil312/PHIL312.html">online</a> (<i>online</i> is a good keyword too -- as you'll note your Smart "sensations" is there with the proper jstor key --- as well as probably others---but thats for like part IX; still workin on text and titles  :)
<br>
<br><a href="http://www.mhhe.com/catalogs/0073659339.mhtml">"Table of contents" searle "can computers think?"</a>  ... well now heres just another ole book that has not only searl but theres ole U T Place too in the table of contents.......

<br>your universities and journals are gona be your best bet for sure but then you have some decissions to make when your stringing together your proxies :)
<br>
<br>authorities are another route as chalmers page displays hundreds of online papers ... just not the ones you want at this time ... but another time&#33;&#33;
<br>
<br>lots of keywords to use if your flowcharting, i can't begin to list those that work well (sometimes) ... online, papers, text, etext, e-text,.txt, full text, electronic books, ebooks, e-books, pdf, doc. rtf, etc etc etc
<br> 
<br>visualizing what inside book looks like: Contents, table of contents, chapter, etc etc etc
<br>
<br>actual text is best :) ... how to find some and use it when Title gives you useless spam... etc etc etc
<br>
<br>filename guessing
<br>
<br><a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=chalmers.pdf&btnG=Google+Search">guessing is always fun :)</a>
<br>i have no idea what is 5.7 mgs or 71mgs in that chalmers.pdf and don't have 5 hours to waste downloading to check it out (though the name of index and the contents don't give me much of a clue as to content --- like say if one of the directories was <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&safe=off&q=chalmers+ascii&btnG=Google+Search">/philosophy/ </a> i'd have a better zenful feeling)
<br>
<br>specific search engines: -- <i>search philosophy</i> -- gives nice search engines
<br>etc etc
<br>
<br>only looked for searle and putnam so far but am learning alot as i go ... like how to waste an hour in databases typing in put<b>m</b>an  before realizing for an hour of grrrrrrrrrrr, No Returns found, that it was suppossed to be putNam. heh

</td></tr><tr><td><ul>
<table><tr><td bgcolor=#d0d0c0>if you search: 
<br>Hilary Putnam, "Brains and Behavior" ...55 returns 
<br>
<br>you will get an entirely different return than: 
<br>
<br>Putnam "Brains and Behavior" ... 163 returns 
<br>
<br>I generaly think less is better because one is specific, while the other allows stemming, if you see what i mean (for lack of a better vocabulary ) </td></tr><tr><td bgcolor=#c0c0d8>
<br>question for you searchers.. if i get about 50-150 results, i usually
<br>tack "&num=100&filter=0" to the end of the url, to get as most results
<br>in one screen as possible, then quickly scan/evaluate every result from
<br>in google, and actually clicking on about 15% of the results.
<br>
<br>especially when you do this after 3 or 5 other searches [so you get
<br>a bit comfortable within the topic your researching], you can quickly
<br>with a short glance decide whether you've found another book-site that
<br>is trying to sell you the book, or some more obscure site that might
<br>actually present real text for download.
<br>
<br>"eh ritz, what was your question?" (..) oh right, the question is of 
<br>course if you use similar tactics, what you think of this method, etc.
<br>
<br>by the way, you would be surprised at the very low rate of success
<br>this approach has. :) perhaps i'm just a lousy seeker, or perhaps
<br>there is something generally wrong with this method.
<br>my reasoning for using it is that the keywords i used to get the
<br>50-150 results should most definitely appear in the text i'm looking
<br>for, so if i just take a look at all of them (takes me 5-10 minutes)
<br>i should find it. 
<br>
<br>ideas?

yeah; when its margarita time :)
<br>
<br>well looks like very little interest in this side by side 
<br>
<br>will give it another day or so.
<br>
<br>things to remember when rabbits pop out of hole:
<br>1.if it is a javascript pop-up --- then turn OFF your js
<br>or
<br>2.if a pop-up pops in js before page loads and you can't get to page source
<br>then use the view-source trick.
<br>
<br>example:
<br>Introduction to Philosophy: Main Problems
<br>... God. Jan 9. Pascal, ?Of the Necessity of the Wager? (online, not in text).
<br>Jan 14. ... Mar 20. JJC Smart ?Sensations and Brain Processes?. Mar 25. ...
<br><a href="http://subcortex.com/introphil/">subcortex.com/introphil/</a> - 38k - Cached - Similar pages
<br>
<br>pop-up prevents page loading and requests a pass.......
<br>now try this way:
<br>view-source:http://subcortex.com/introphil/
<br>
<br>and inside source you see the pass ---------
<br>
<br>my notes are bad; but if i recall back 2 days ago one of your articles was protected this way..........
<br>
<br>your posts do not sound like you are a newby seeker - so these are notes more for  beginning beertimers :)
<br>
<br><hr>
<br>
<br>we already know that 2 of your articles 
<br>U.T. Place, "Is Consciousness a Brain Process?"
<br>J.J.C. Smart, "SensATIONS AND bRAIN pROCESSES" 
<br>are available thru j s t o r
<br>
<br><hr>
<br>
<br>lets pick another of your articles, 
<br>
<br><a href="http://216.239.33.104/search?q=cache:_M4W-voICDIJ:highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/0072878274/student_view0/chapter2/theories.html+pdf+Putnam+%22The+Nature+of+mental+States%22&hl=en&ie=UTF-8">Putnam, "The Nature of mental States"</a>
<br>
