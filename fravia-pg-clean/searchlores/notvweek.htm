"Je n'ai qu'une vie. Je ne la regarderai pas
passer par procuration devant un poste de télévision"<br>

Too much information running through your brain?
</fonT><bR><br>
This year, create some thinking space by leaving your TV screen
blank for one week. You'll be one of millions of people around the
world joining this TV fast. The short term goal of this social
ritual is to encourage more people to create their own brand of
entertainment -- a powerful gesture of consumer sovereignty. The
broader goal is to draw attention to the fact that a handful of
megacorporations now control the global information superstructure
and routinely censor opinions that challenge their interests and
profitability.
  <bR><br>
While the television universe has been expanding, the number of
corporations that control it has been steadily shrinking. Right
now, television is controlled by seven megacorporations in the US
and strongly dominated by three worldwide. Our 5000-channel
universe has become limited by a narrow scope of corporate filters
-- ones driven by the interests of big-money sponsors like the
global auto makers, oil companies and the fast-food and fashion
industries.
  <bR><br>
As media concentration has increased, diversity of opinion has
decreased. Viewpoints that challenge sponsors' interests have been
virtually eliminated from the world's most powerful medium.
Television has become a mass merchandizing tool, and in the
process, we the people have been effectively shut out of the
culture-making process.
 <bR><br>
In fact, it would appear that freedom of opinion and expression do
not exist on the airwaves.

3 heures 40 de télévision par
         jour, c'est la dose moyenne par français
</fonT><bR><br>
Soir après soir, nous
         sommes assis durant de longues heures face à une lumière scintillante. Les mêmes images
         pénètrent nos cerveaux, uniformisent nos
         existences, nos connaissances, nos goûts, nos
         désirs. Nous passons plus d'heures à regarder
         des émissions sur la nature qu'à la vivre dans
         sa réalité ; plus de temps à rire des
         plaisanteries à la télévision
         qu'à plaisanter nous-mêmes ; plus de temps
         à regarder des scènes simulées de sexualité qu'à faire l'amour.
<br><br>
Notre psychique est
         submergé par les assauts de milliers d'images jouant avec notre sensibilité, notre affect. Des millions de
         spots publicitaires conditionnent notre inconscient
         collectif et façonnent l'idéologie dominante de la télévision. Une idéologie
         où la jouissance immédiate par la consommation
         prime sur toute volonté de sens. A force de
         répétition, notre capacité d'attention
         se trouve diminuée, notre imagination et notre esprit critique s'épuisent, et nous avons de plus de plus de
         mal à nous consacrer aux valeurs essentielles.
  <br><br>      
"Une semaine sans
         télévision" est une tentative collective pour
         sauvegarder notre plus précieuse ressource:
la lucidité.

Fravia's own contribution</fonT></center><bR><font size=+1>
 
The no-TV week promoted by 

<font color=blue>[</font><a href="http://www.adbusters.org/campaigns/tvturnoff/">adbuster</a><font color=blue>]</font> 

and <font color=blue>[</font><a href="http://antipub.net/cccp/sanstele.htm">antipub.net</a><font color=blue>]</font>
is 
IMO a worthy initiative, which deserves to be better known.   There are many attempts 
nowadays to 'take back' the most worthy of our possessions: our life and our time from 
the icy grasp of the commercial bastards that would like to have us watching their 
crap when we are inside a lift (targeted ads in lifts, EU), when we are 
travelling through railways 
tunnel (stroboscopic ads in the tunnels, CH) and even when  we will look at the 
evening sky (laser ads projects, States). There are some first signs of resistence... 
more and more people are for instance now demanding that shops REMAIN CLOSED on 
sunday, so that their kids have at least a day that is different from all the others 
(for whatever purpose -bar buying things- they'll find fit), and some other 
are even introducing unilaterally another "no consume" day in their weeks  
(I have  
chosen wednesday) so that at least twice a week 
you can do something more interesting than visiting with 
your kids a mall  (where you are <font color=blue>[</font><a href="realicra/slaves.htm">conditioned to buy</a><font color=blue>]</font> things that you 
do not need). But TV, this 'whip to spur the slaves to consume' must be countered as well.<br><br> 
No TV for a whole week: a worthy initiative indeed... it wont be difficult for 
me to adhere, since - as I 
wrote long ago - one of my most peculiar endowments is the capacity of 
NON watching for months any TV at all.

<bR><bR>Yet          
I will be sincere: I must confess that I still watch TV every now and then, though these 
already short periods are indeed shrinking to nil. There is a channel here in 
Europe, <font color=blue>[</font><a href="http://www.arte-tv.com/">Arte</a><font color=blue>]</font> which is 
a public Franco-German broadcast, with a relative low level of advertisement, that is supposed to 
cater to quality, not to audience rate. This channel   actually <u>does</u> at times 
broadcast something of interest.<br><br> 
Anyway - just in case - one should 
never watch TV "directly": of course we should give 
our videorecorders the important task to 'watch television' at our place. 
Apparates slurp thus all advertisement so that humans can (later, eventually, maybe) examine 
quickly
whatever is supposed to have had some interest,  fast-forwarding over 
any moronical  interruption.<bR>
I believe that at least some squares, in many towns of our 
planet, should have statues of the 
inventor of the videorecorder (whoever he was). He gave us freedom from TV, a very difficult 
task. Note also that it is relatively easier to avoid watching videorecorders&nbsp;:-) Heil to the 
inventor of the videorecorder! Greek heroes' fatigues pale when 
confronted with such a beficial feat!<br><br> 
So -as I was saying- I do at times watch some telefilms I am interested in, indeed, but 
 already in the late eighties I stopped watching what the slavemasters sarcastically call 'information' on 
TV. Even checking (collating) the same info on -say- a French, a German and an 
English channel did not bring me nowhere. Same bunch of pre-formatted lies. The concerted propaganda is truly 
'transnational'... in its most abominable forms.<bR> 
You'll find <font color=blue>[</font><a href="papers.htm">elsewhere</a><font color=blue>]</font> on my site a discussion about the difficulties 
of finding some real snippets of information in this increasingly 
propagandistic and bombastic 
media soup we are supposed to happily slurp.<br>In order to (try to) 
understand what is really happening 
around, 
I personally 
use at the moment either <font color=blue>[</font><a href="papers.htm#rarsni">printed 
press</a><font color=blue>]</font> or 
web media: a combination of "<i>Le Monde Diplomatique</i>", 
the "<i>Neue Zürcher Zeitung</i>", 
"<i>The Economist</i>", "<i>Die Zeit</i>" (this last weekly 
is unfortunately getting less and less useful) 
plus some snippets of real 
information I am able to find on the web. But you should 
never forget that 
each one of these sources of information has his own dangerous bias and his owners'  
(as opposed to yours) 
interests to defend.<br><br>In the Television 
landscape things are <u>much</u> worser. My kids  have never seen 
anything else than their (wide) collection of cartoon and animal wildlife 
videotapes on TV. They are only now beginning to 
realize that there is a 'broadcasted TV' as well, out there.<bR>Of course they will, 
soon enough, watch TV-channels like their friends do, 
yet I hope that 
the long time spent with  films  of accettable quality 
will give them some 
advantage in judging and choosing what they intend to 
see. 
Time will tell... maybe our  
approach is completely wrong: centuries ago the Mongols set their kid 
on a horse and then prodded this
until the kid learned to ride (or knocked his head on the ground&nbsp;:-)<br>Maybe to-day parents SHOULD put 
their kids early in the morning in front of the awful crap (and kid-targeted 
advertisement) that 
all TV channels spit out without interruptions. And then leave them there, the longest the 
better. Maybe thattaway they will survive perfectly in the zombies' society we live in. But 
I doubt it and I simply cannot perform such a crime.<br>
<bR>
So it will not be difficult for me to join the no-TV week promoted by 

<font color=blue>[</font><a href="http://www.adbusters.org/campaigns/tvturnoff/">adbuster</a><font color=blue>]</font> 
and <font color=blue>[</font><a href="http://antipub.net/cccp/sanstele.htm">antipub.net</a><font color=blue>]</font>, but 
at times I wonder if reversers should not rather <u>do the contrary</u> 
and WATCH some tv for a whole week: it would be instructive to say the least.<br>
I am really convinced that Goebbels would be proud of the techniques used 
nowadays to present what they ironically call 'information' on TV. Maybe we should watch all kind of 
TV's 'offerings' more often 
for our social reversing purposes.<br><br>For 
a reverser there is much to learn -for instance-  
from these 
incredible 'afternoon sitcoms' with paid laughers that 'underline' the 'puns' from 
'outside the camera' (a pavlovian technique if I ever saw one). 'Prime rate' emissions 
are also great fun, with their fantastically  
petty philosophies: most sitcoms struggle hard to reach the cultural level of a meeting 
of Barbie dolls. Finally, if you want a quick glimpse of the ultrasqualor, 
you should take the time to watch TV in the morning, say around 
11.00 ~ 11.30. Be warned! That will leave you with some brain-scars but will deliver mighty reversing 
knowledge...<br><br>But this we should not do during the 
turn-off week, eh! 
From 22 to 28 April we are not going to watch any TV at all&nbsp;:-P
