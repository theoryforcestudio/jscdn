<hr width=44%></center><i>A very interesting approach... let's hope some readers will 
find the time to deepen this work.</i><hr>
    
  <br>

As all readers of Fravia's searchlores should be aware of, 
commercial oriented souls  are now to be found everywhere on the web. 
Some of them are even trying (and managing to) 
make money with so-called search engine ranking / testing / algos 
reversing and the like.<br>
<p>
Since I personally don't like such people at all (and since I can't 
punish them in other ways - at least for now : &quot;A searcher could 
develop hisself into a dangerous fellow, if he needs to&quot; - Fravia+), I 
have deceided to write some essays about these interesting 
lores. I hope that the more seekers as 
possible will work on the tricks I have found, improve them, and eventually, make 
the commercial bastards out of business, because the 
*knowledge* they are trying to sell or use will be free for anyone...<br>
<p>
Nota bene: you have to work on these findings on your own. Unfortunately, I don't 
have the time (nor some other things) to work all day on them. Consider this 
small essay a 'starting path'.<br>

<p>
<p>
Introduction<br>
<p>
What are the primary tools all searchers use? The search 
engines. Quite Logic.<br>
How much of the Web does these search engine index? Nobody know it 
precisely (most estimates move between 25 and 40%). But the fact is that no search engine covers all the Web. 
Consequently, provided you know what it means, selecting your 
search engine in regards of its size could be a good idea.<br>
<p>
In fact, the size of a search engine is important for various reasons. First, the 
more sites there are, the more results you are supposed to have. 
Then, the more sites there are, the more chances you have to find 
interresting results with a complex query. Finally, the more sites 
there are, the more advanced the interface with them (that is, the 
search engine query possibilities) will be (you can't index 300+ million sites 
with the same search options that 50+ million).<br>
<p>
Nevertheless, do not forget some old truths. The size of a search engine has 
nothing to do (or so few) with the number of unique results it gives. 
THIS point is one of the more important for us (it will be dealt in 
another essay). Besides, the size of a search engine is directly 
linked to the number of 404 errors it gives, more sites to manage 
meaning necessarely more problems with the quicksand Web.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Let's go<br>
<p>
All this must be quite interresting, but how do we find the sizes of 
our search engines? I mean, without relying on commercial 
estimations, which are most of the time completely useless for us.<br>
<p>
The answer is with our brains. Actually, why a searchable index of 
sites couldn't display all the sites it have in memory (provided it 
doesn't have timeout limitations or the like)? That would be 
illogical...<br>
<p>
With this constatation in mind, I've played a little with some big 
search engine and have found interresting results that I share here. Enjoy, 
and work on them.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p><font size=+3>
 Northernlight attack</font><br>
<p>
 As you have probably seen elsewhere on the Fravia's site, it is 
indeed possible to have the entire size of Northernlight. Just run 
this query:<br> 
<a href="http://www.northernlight.com/nlquery.fcg?cb=0&amp;qr=search+or+not+search&amp;orl=2%3A1">http://www.northernlight.com/nlquery.fcg?cb=0&amp;qr=search+or+not+search&amp;orl=2%3A1</a>
<br>and you will see how much URLs does 
Northernlight have today.<br>
<p>
 I will give some explainations about that trick.<br>
 OR and NOT are boolean operators; they are used to enable a 
kind of logic with the terms they are relating to.<br>
 For example, the query &quot;search OR seek&quot; will give you all the 
pages of an index which have the word search OR the word seek in 
them. Of course, they could also have the both words.<br>
 Always for example, the query &quot;NOT search&quot; will give you all the 
pages of an index which have NOT the word search in them.<br>
<p>
 You should be close to 2 conclusions.<br>
 The first : <font color=blue>OR</font>ing a search broads it, <font color=blue>NOT</font>ing a search narrows it.<br>
 The second : given that the query &quot;search&quot; give all the pages with 
the word search in them and that the query &quot;NOT search&quot; give all 
the pages that have NOT the word search in them, ORing these 
two querries will give the entire size of a database.<br>
<p>
 This second conclusion is used with Northernlight.<br>
<p>
 As soon as a search engine supports the OR and NOT operators, try these 
kind of query. Nevertheless, the search engine in question must support 
entirely the NOT operator. That is, not the "NOT between two terms":  
the <u>NOT with only one term</u>.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p><font size=+3>
 Infoseek attack</font><br>
<p>
 Infoseek is also kindly enough to allow us to get its full size 
quickly. Just run this query:<br> 
<a href="http://infoseek.go.com/Titles?qt=url%3Ahttp&amp;svx=home_searchbox&amp;sv=IS&amp;lk=noframes&amp;nh=25">http://infoseek.go.com/Titles?qt=url%3Ahttp&amp;svx=home_searchbox&amp;sv=IS&amp;lk=noframes&amp;nh=25</a><br>
<p>
 As you will notice, here I have used the url search.<br>
 Actually, Infoseek allows searchers to search for words in the 
URLs of considered documents.<br>
 For example, if you want to find all the indexed sites with &quot;search&quot; 
in their URLs, just made an url search on &quot;search&quot; and appreciate 
the results.<br>
<p>
 One thing should now make &quot;tilt&quot; in your mind.<br>
 Given that most of the search engine index Web sites, ALL the URLs in their 
database will begin with &quot;http&quot;.<br>
 So, a query like &quot;url:http&quot; should give us all the sites which adress 
is beginning with &quot;http&quot;... In other words, this query will give us the 
full index of a search engine<br>
<p>
 This trick is used with Infoseek.<br>
 Of course, it could also be used with Northenlight; see below:<br>
<a href="http://www.northernlight.com/nlquery.fcg?dx=1004&amp;qr=&amp;qt=&amp;pu=&amp;qu=http&amp;si=&amp;la=All&amp;qc=All&amp;d1=&amp;d2=&amp;rv=1&amp;search.x=43&amp;searchy=10#">http://www.northernlight.com/nlquery.fcg?dx=1004&amp;qr=&amp;qt=&amp;pu=&amp;qu=http<br>&amp;si=&amp;la=All&amp;qc=All&amp;d1=&amp;d2=&amp;rv=1&amp;search.x=43&amp;searchy=10#</a>

<p>
 As soon as a search engine allows an URL search, try it to see what 
happens about the number of sites returned. In fact, some big search engine 
have limited their URL search to the part AFTER the &quot;//&quot; of &quot;http://&quot;. 
So, the trick used here won't be of any use. But there are other 
possibilities, many others....<br>
<p>
<p>
<p><font size=+3>
 FAST attack</font><br>
<p>
 FAST claims to have 300+ million sites. I'm happy to say they are 
right&nbsp;:-)<br>
 Like Infoseek or Northenlight, FAST is a good search engine for size study. 
Try this query, and tell me whether you like it or not:<br>
<a href="http://www.ussc.alltheweb.com/cgi-bin/advsearch?terms=3&amp;type=any&amp;query=&amp;lang=any&amp;A1=&amp;B1=http&amp;C1=url.all%3A&amp;A2=&amp;B2=&amp;C2=&amp;A3=&amp;B3=&amp;C3=&amp;dincl=&amp;dexcl=&amp;hits=10&amp;exec=FAST+Search">http://www.ussc.alltheweb.com/cgi-bin/advsearch?terms=3&amp;type=any&amp;query=&amp;lang=any&amp;A1=&amp;<br>B1=http&amp;C1=url.all%3A&amp;A2=&amp;B2=&amp;C2=&amp;A3=&amp;B3=&amp;C3=&amp;dincl=&amp;dexcl=&amp;hits=10&amp;exec=FAST+Search</A><br>
<p>
 FAST is a special search engine &quot;en ce sens que&quot; it doesn't 
support keywords searching. Nor boolean for that matter. You are compelled to 
use a form in order to search effectively. But, we don't care : new 
experiences are searchers' everyday bread...<br>
<p>
 One of the FAST advanced option is to put word filters for our 
queries. What is interesting, is that you can define the elements of 
a page which have to contain some desired words: title, text, 
links, and ..URLs.<br>
<p>
 Consequently, if we just choose that the pages we want must 
contain the word &quot;http&quot; in their URLs, the results should be all the 
sites of the database. And loo! This happens.<br>
<p>
 Similarly to the URL search, if you want the size of a search engine that 
allows you to filter its results by fields, you should play a little with 
the URL filter &quot;http&quot;. Note, however, that very few search engine allow this 
kind of filtering.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p><font size=+3>
 Lycos attack</font><br>
<p>
 Actually, I do not know if the results of this attack really mean what I believe. 
Just click there:<br>  
<a href="http://search.lycos.com/adv.aspsrchpro/?aloc=sb_init_field&amp;first=1&amp;lpv=1&amp;type=advwebsites&amp;query=&amp;t=all&amp;qt=&amp;qu=http&amp;qh=&amp;x=26&amp;y=5">http://search.lycos.com/adv.aspsrchpro/?aloc=sb_init_field&amp;first=1&amp;lpv=1&amp;<br>type=advwebsites&amp;query=&amp;t=all&amp;qt=&amp;qu=http&amp;qh=&amp;x=26&amp;y=5</a>
<br>
and you will notice that the number of results is EXACTLY the 
same as the FAST one.<br>
<p>
 Consequently, I begin to believe that these two share a common database (I may be 
wrong of course, awaiting your own conclusions).<br>
<p>
<p>
<p><font size=+3>
 Hotbot attack</font><br>
<p>
 Hotbot is also a special case, because it belongs to Lycos. So, I 
think it shares the Lycos/FAST database as well. Nevertheless, 
finding evidences of that is quite *difficult*, because the options in 
Hotbot are specials.<br>
<p>
 Here, no URL search nor refining, and no NOT trick could be used. 
We have to think.<br>
 Let's peruse the help. We see that some fields searching are 
allowed, among other oddities : depth, within, before, after,...<br>
 After trying a little, I've come to the conclusion that the query:<br> 
<a href="http://hotbot.lycos.com/text/default.asp?MT=depth%3A4+feature%3Aacrobat+feature%3Aapplet+feature%3Aactivex+feature%3Aaudio+feature%3Aembed+feature%3Aflash+feature%3Aform+feature%3Aframe+feature%3Aimage+feature%3Ascript+feature%3Ashockwave+feature%3Atable+feature%3Avideo+feature%3Avrml&amp;search=SEARCH&amp;SM=B&amp;DV=0&amp;LG=any&amp;DC=10&amp;DE=2">http://hotbot.lycos.com/text/default.asp?MT=depth%3A4+feature%3Aacrobat
<br>+feature%3Aapplet+feature%3Aactivex+feature%3Aaudio+feature%3Aembed+feature%3Aflash<br>+feature%3Aform+feature%3Aframe+feature%3Aimage+feature%3Ascript+feature%3Ashockwave<br>+feature%3Atable+feature%3Avideo+feature%3Avrml&amp;search=SEARCH&amp;SM=B&amp;DV=0&amp;LG=any&amp;DC=10&amp;DE=2</a>
<br>
is the one which 
give the more results with Hotbot.<br>
<p>
 The trick is to OR all the possible search options, in order to broad 
as much as possible the number of results.<br>
 The only problem is that the number returned is not the size of the 
entire database, but only of a big part of it. So, it's just a more or 
less precise estimation.<br>
<p>
 By the way, you will notice that there are more sites in the Hotbot 
database than in the FAST/Lycos one. This shouldn't be so, because, as 
said, Hotbot BELONGS to Lycos.<br>
 The explanation might by the following : Hotbot was bought by 
Lycos, but before, it was an independant search engine, with its own index. 
So, I think that now, Hotbot uses the FAST/Lycos database <u>in 
addition</u> of its previous one.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p><font size=+3>
 Yahoo attack</font><br>
<p>
 I won't even bother searching to list all the URLs at Yahoo, 
because it's already done. Actually, for each category, Yahoo 
display the number of sites it has recorded. So, with some simple 
maths (additions that is) you can easily find the global size of the Yahoo 
database.<br>
<p>
 Of course, you don't have to display all the pages each time you 
want to count the number of sites. Just build your own &quot;Yahoo size 
fetcher&quot; bot and let him work for you. The section <a href="bots.htm">about 
bot-building</a> could be an interesting beginning for this point. Keep 
in mind that the number of reported sites is always enclosed into parenthesis; this 
will make things easy for your script.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p><font size=+3>
 Altavista attack</font><br>
<p>
 This one is hard, due to Alta's damned "timeout" limit.<br><br>
 Given that Atlavista supports the NOT search, let's try this query:<br> 
<a href="http://www.altavista.com/cgi-bin/query?hl=on&amp;q=%28search+OR+NOT+search%29&amp;search=Search&amp;r=&amp;kl=XX&amp;stype=&amp;pg=aq&amp;text=yes&amp;d0=&amp;d1=">http://www.altavista.com/cgi-bin/query?hl=on&amp;q=%28search+OR+NOT+search%29&amp;<br>search=Search&amp;r=&amp;kl=XX&amp;stype=&amp;pg=aq&amp;text=yes&amp;d0=&amp;d1=</a>

<br>It's 
impossible!! Altavista's database cannot be so small.<br><br>
 Given that Altavista supports the URL search, let's try this query:<br> 
<a href="http://www.altavista.com/cgi-bin/query?hl=on&amp;q=url%3Ahttp&amp;search=Search&amp;r=&amp;kl=XX&amp;stype=&amp;pg=aq&amp;text=yes&amp;d0=&amp;d1=">http://www.altavista.com/cgi-bin/query?hl=on&amp;q=url%3Ahttp&amp;<br>search=Search&amp;r=&amp;kl=XX&amp;stype=&amp;pg=aq&amp;text=yes&amp;d0=&amp;d1=</a>

<br>Impossible!! Something must be 
wrong.<br>
<p>
 Actually, Altavista has a timeout. That is, it doesn't scan all its 
database. Consequently, we can never have all the sites it has indexed 
this way.<br>
<p>
 But, we can play a little with the Date filtering. Remember: 
filtering can fetch incredible results if used correctly.<br>
<p>
 After some tries, I've discovered these two complementary queries:<br>
<a href="http://www.altavista.com/cgi-bin/query?hl=on&amp;q=search+OR+NOT+search&amp;search=Search&amp;r=&amp;kl=XX&amp;stype=&amp;pg=aq&amp;text=yes&amp;d0=01%2F01%2F70&amp;d1=01%2F01%2F00">http://www.altavista.com/cgi-bin/query?hl=on&amp;q=search+OR+NOT+search&amp;<br>search=Search&amp;r=&amp;kl=XX&amp;stype=&amp;pg=aq&amp;text=yes&amp;d0=01%2F01%2F70&amp;d1=01%2F01%2F00</a>

<br>and<br>
<a href="http://www.altavista.com/cgi-bin/query?hl=on&amp;q=search+OR+NOT+search&amp;search=Search&amp;r=&amp;kl=XX&amp;stype=&amp;pg=aq&amp;text=yes&amp;d0=01%2F01%2F00&amp;d1=">http://www.altavista.com/cgi-bin/query?hl=on&amp;q=search+OR+NOT+search&amp;<br>search=Search&amp;r=&amp;kl=XX&amp;stype=&amp;pg=aq&amp;text=yes&amp;d0=01%2F01%2F00&amp;d1=</a>

<p>
 The addition of the two results give something strange yet. 
Provided the engineers at Altavista are not totally incompetent with 
their Date system, all the estimations I have seen until now about 
this search engine size seem to be wrong: 
Altavista seems to have nearly 430+ million of sites indexed !!<br>
<p>
<p>
<p><font size=+3>
 Other search engine attack</font><br>
<p>
 I hope you will find more tips and tricks on your own. Each search engine 
can be &quot;reversed&quot; differently. It's up to you to find the &quot;magic 
queries&quot;!!<br>
<p>
<p>
 <font size=+3>
Conclusion</font><br>
<p>
You now have enough material to work on this "search engine size" stuff. The principle is 
simple: use queries that returns the more possible results.<br>
You could also think about writing a &quot;search engine size survey&quot; bot. In fact, 
running all these queries each time you want to compare the search engine 
sizes would be insane.<br>
