Using our knowledge and the depth of the web to fight our commercial enemies<bR></center><i>
Zarathustra, a friend (at times) of Faulpelz, will show you below a simple yet incredibly 
effective 
idea to retaliate against a commercial site that dared annoy you. In fact the 
proposed solution is of almost perfect elegance:</i> <ul><li>what are commercial sites based on? Greed.
</lI><li>how do you punish greedy people? You take them their wealth away, until (if ever) 
they will 
understand that only knowledge, and not money, has any meaning at all</lI></ul><i>
Of course the process of teaching knowledge to the commercial idiots -incidentally 
ruining them-  may take a long time... this being always the case with all learning  
processes. Teachers and all kind of other Samaritans, like, us should have a lot of patience (and some good automated scripts). Enjoy!&nbsp;</i>:-)

Search Engine pitfalls and how to strike back<br>

Whenever you search for something on the net sooner or later you
have to check the results. Even if you are an advanced
seeker, able to sieve out most traps you cannot avoid all
lures that are setup purposely just to push some shrill
popups/banners down your eyes.<br>Of course we use all our filters, proxies, 
firewall, HOSTS files and all other "<a href="fau_zar.htm#magic">magic pouch</a>" tricks up our sleeves 
to avoid most of this crap, but sometimes
this does not work 100% and we still have to look at ugly-colored commercial ads... 
 often enough incredibly 
silly ("click on the moving monkey to win" "from which country does Scwarzenheidegger come 
from?" Man! Just their <u>implied weltanschauung</u> insults me a lot!). 
<bR><bR>Do we really want to live with this? Do we have to? 
I think NO! I believe 
that the eyes of a seekers are far too precious juwels and I am convinced they should NOT be sullied by
 such vulgar crap.<br><bR>
We must and we can strike back... How should we retaliate and punish the offenders?<br>
<ul>
<li>
resubmitting the URL to the Search Engine again and again until the URL is blocked?
</lI><li>
reporting the URL as spam/illegal content etc., if the SE
is offering such an option?<br>
</li></ul>
Well, yes... this may work - sometimes - but not always... and for an accomplished ~Seeker~ it is 
just not 'elegant' to have to rely on such 'dubious' solutions.<br>
<p><br>
I have devised  another 'completely different' approach in order to solve this
problem. An approach that has the added advantage of solving in most cases the problem 
forever.
<ul>
<li>grab all sponsor-URL's of the site (Attention: NOT ALL banner-URL's on a 
    site are 'sponsor'-URL's!) and copy them into your favourite editor.
   You will get a list like the following one:<br>
   <ul>
   <li><a href="https://searchlores.nickifaulk.com/redirect?http://www.banner1.com/track.dll?id=234234" target="WMLink3AA42F34">http://www.banner1.com/track.dll?id=234234</a><br>
   <li><a href="https://searchlores.nickifaulk.com/redirect?http://www.banner2.com/click.exe?user=mymoney" target="WMLink3AA42F35">http://www.banner2.com/click.exe?user=mymoney</a><br>
   <li><font color=blue>...</fonT>
   </ul>
<li>remove all queries and additional paths from the URL's:<br>
   <ul>
   <li><a href="https://searchlores.nickifaulk.com/redirect?http://www.banner1.com/" target="WMLink3AA42F36">http://www.banner1.com/</a><br>
   <li><a href="https://searchlores.nickifaulk.com/redirect?http://www.banner2.com/" target="WMLink3AA42F37">http://www.banner2.com/</a><br>
   <li><font color=blue>...</fonT>
   </ul>
   
<li>Now to the interesting part: visit all listed sponsoring site(s)...
   Interesting? You don't think so!? Yes, it is... Eheh: read the 'terms' 
(or however they call those warnings)
   on the sponsor site(s). Can you already feel what we will do? 
   No!? Go further... READ the terms again and you will find sentences 
   like the following:
   </font><pre>
   >... will pay you for unique visitors that enter our website(s) 
   >received from a banner(s) served from your website. The amount 
   >you are paid is $1 50 per sign-up. . Tampering will lead to 
   >termination, loss of all funds, and possibly prosecution. ...

   >All clicks you send to us must come from a webpage. We do 
   >not allow email links/spamming or any other such practices 
   >that could reflect negatively on our program. Failure to comply 
   >to this request will result in the immediate cancellation of 
   >the account from which the hits were sent and also may result 
   >in the forfeiture of any funds owed to that account. 
   >SPAMMING IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED.

   >... In addition to the foregoing,
   >we will immediately terminate your participation in the 
   >Program if we believe you have engaged in any of the 
   >following:
   >- Unsolicited mass e-mail solicitations, IRC postings or 
   >any other form of spamming, including but not limited to, 
   >newsgroups or AOL customers or otherwise violate the 
   >anti-spamming policies of COMPANY or state law;
   >- Attempt to cheat, defraud or mislead us in any way;
   >- Promote passwords, MP3, or Warez;</prE><font size=+1>

   Now I am sure you can feel it... you already know how we will retaliate&nbsp;:)

<li>simply violate one or two terms where the webmaster looses all
   his 'hard earned' money (whereby luring zombies should not be classified as 
hard work, should it?)
   <br><br>
   You can for instance set up a site (on geocities, ...) and use the 
   webmasters banner-URL's! If it is not allowed to use the same 
   ID on different sites he looses his money, because the sponsors 
   are tracking all visitors, so they will recognize the second site. 
   If it is not allowed to use porn, then place some porn pictures on 
   your site ('nudity' or 'breasts' are in most cases enough...) As most 
   sponsors are paying their webmasters monthly you will have to lean back, 
   wait and check the target-site from time to time! If the webmaster has 
   removed all banners then you won, if he has just changed his sponsor(s) 
   you can restart the game until he gives up.<br><br>
Since you'r already at it, do a thorough job: use your target's working 
emails, copy a large amount of his site on your faked copy, so to make it almost impossible 
for him to claim he "didn't know about that site".
   <br><br>
   If you don't want to set up a second site, then just  use one of the 
many perl-script that push 
   clickrates. There were a quantity of these scripts to make quick money with 
the advertisement idiots a couple of years ago, until they developed means of 
detecting them. But <u>to be detected is exactly what you want in this case!</u><bR> 
The script should simply click at the given banner-URL's 
   100-1000 times via *ROTATING* (and of course semi-anonymous) proxies. 
The sponsors 
   will detect this type of 'manipulation', but I hope fravia's readers will add to this essay
   some new easy to use <i>ad hoc</i> perl scripts.<bR><br>
   This are just some examples how you can kick in the groin a commercial webmaster you dislike 
until he's put out of 
   the game. In the best case he is healed forever (he learns the correct path) 
and in the worst case even better 
   things could happen: since he thinks he his 'innocent' he may post 
   flames about his 'bad experiences' with sponsor-x at some boards/newsgroups 
   moaning that sponsor-x are unreliable, because they did not paid 
   him... and it's highly possible, that this will influence others and damage all of them. How nice!&nbsp;:-)
</ul>
<p>
   I think now you understand the game I'm proposing you, so have fun and strike back wherever 
   you feel you have to! Forward ~Seekers~&nbsp;!<br>
