<br><font size=+1><i>Old A+heist reappeared out of the blue with an interesting short essay: how to 
prepare a research at pre-university level, full-fledged and thoroughly valid,  on a given argument 
(here in his example: <font color=navyblue>Dinosauria</font>) in a very short amount of time. As the Author 
himself points out: 
"<font color=navyblue>Unfortunately, finding journals and texts is often 
easier than evaluating them</font>".<br>
A problem I have noticed (observing my own kids) is that most "school-searches" <font color=navyblue>are nowadays 
made just using 
google and wikipedia</font>. Not "<u>starting</u>" from google and wikipedia: "<u>just</u>".<br> 
Please understand me right: I admire wikipedia and 
think it is one of the best knowledge tools around. But it is still a 
tool for <u>general</u>, unevaluated knowledge. Should be used as a springboard, not as a swimming pool. 
Else, since most pre-university students (and alas many 
university students as well) don't know any <a href="https://searchlores.nickifaulk.com/evaluate.htm&quot;">evaluation lore</a> at all, 
such an approach could bring to catastrophic results from a scientific point of view. A "research" made using 
just google and wikipedia, while still barely acceptable for pre-university students is surely NOT a good idea 
for university level students.  In fact there are many better, more effective, relatively simple and 
scientifically solider ways to proceed, as this paper by our fellow +HCUker A+heist 
intends to prove... strangely as it might seem... arriving to a wealth of scientific material after having 
STARTED from wikipedia and after having used 
almost exclusively the <a href="main.htm">main search engines</a>.<br>Here lies  
the very worthiness of this paper: our readers will be able to apply its many 
searching-teachings (beautifully resumed in the "<a href="how_to_research.htm#conclus">conclusions</a>")
  to many different (and 
"saurian-unrelated") targets.</i>

<br><font size=+1>OK, this is going to be a broad list of 
possible 'angles' you could use when searching scientific material 
on the web. Among other aims, we intend to find which Authors, texts and even languages 
and specific universities are the 
"top of the tip" for... let's say... "dinosauria-related" sciences.
We don't want "second hand" or "second tier" knowledge, since we are searchers, and we 
"own" the web (being able to grab her most intimate 
parts&nbsp;:-), 
we might as well go for the absolute best.<br>Let's first of all just check how the 
searchscape looks like using google and 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur">wikipedia</a>.
<br>
As you can easily see from this english wikipedia entrance (but it would be foolish not 
to quickly check at least its <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaurier">DE</a> 
and <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaure">FR</a> counterparts), the most interesting parts 
for us, because we are trying to establish a foothold quickly,  
are the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur#Modern_definition">modern definition</a> 
 (where, should we have forgot, we are informed that <font color="navyblue">paleontologists</font> 
 study such matters and that taxonomy discussions are bound to be peppered around) and the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur#Notes_and_references">Notes and references</a> part, that 
we will use to try to gather a useful bibliography.
<br>
<br><center>
<table border="1" width= "97%"><tr><td><center><font color="navyblue">The 'creationist' crap</font></center><br>
Unfortunately some searches are bound to be politically sensitive, and the "Dinosauria" search 
is one of these.
A quick glance at that very <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur#Notes_and_references">Notes and references</a> part 
will show that we have already encountered  
 a problem that we will meet again and again: 
 the crap "creationist discussion", a religious-oriented backward fight going on in the States,  
 that is of no scientific interest whatsoever and that 
we will consider
just useless background noise, and from now on <font color="navyblue">nuke from our desired results</font>.<br>
So a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&hl=en&lr=&client=opera&rls=en&as_qdr=all&q=dinosaur+-creationist+-creationism&btnG=Search">dinosaur  -creationist -creationism</a> 
parameter  will later come handy  in all our queries.<br>
 Incidentally, while for other search-targets it is usually very useful to 
 visit and comb any <u>messageboard</u> focused on the topic you are researching,  
 this  'creationist' crap unfortunately means that searchers should stear clear 
 of all "paleontology" messageboards, since they will be infested by <a href="trolls.htm">trolls and shills</a>.
 </td></tr></table></center>
<br>
I will use in this paper google, yahoo and -occasionally- altavista and A9: be aware of the  
huge differences among the various <a href="main.htm">main search engines</a>: google is globally  
the most effective, 
but its indexes are often quite stale, yahoo has the biggest (and freshest) index, but it is heavily 
dependent from .com sites, altavista is much too easily spammed... and so on.
<br>Well, of course 
when starting with ole google a parameter like 
<font color="navyblue">dinosaur  -creationist -creationism</font> is not enough, given the arrogance of the 
commercial invaders of our web, therefore our searchstrings need a little more cleaning 
just to start with: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&hl=en&lr=&client=opera&rls=en&as_qdr=all&q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Fsearch%3Fas_q%3Ddinosaur%26hl%3Den%26client%3Dopera%26rls%3Den%26num%3D100%26btnG%3DGoogle%2BSearch%26as_epq%3D%26as_oq%3D%26as_eq%3D%26lr%3D%26cr%3D%26as_ft%3Di%26as_filetype%3D%26as_qdr%3Dall%26as_nlo%3D%26as_nhi%3D%26as_occt%3Dany%26as_dt%3Di%26as_sitesearch%3Dedu%26as_rights%3D%26safe%3Dimages&btnG=Search">dinosaur -buy  -youtube -homepage -shop -creationist -creationism 
-film -quiz -Bar-B-Que -download</a>, or maybe we should try a completely different approach: 
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=dinosaur&hl=en&client=opera&rls=en&num=100&btnG=Google+Search&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&lr=&cr=&as_ft=i&as_filetype=&as_qdr=all&as_nlo=&as_nhi=&as_occt=any&as_dt=i&as_sitesearch=edu&as_rights=&safe=images">dinosaur site:edu</a>.
<br>As you can see, if you tried the queries I listed, we are already fishing in cleaner waters.
<br><br>
We were pointing out the "Notes and references" part of the main 'entry' to our target on wikipedia.  When 
searching, however, we have to keep in mind that many gems often "lurk better" in the dark  web
when using <u>specific</u> searchterms: on wikipedia for instance the same "Notes and references" 
list for  
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allosaurus#References">Allosaurus</a> ("strange lizard" because 
"distinguished from any known Dinosaurs by the vertebrae, which are peculiarly modified to ensure lightness": 
aka "the wolf of 
the late Jurassic") 
could  represent a valid starting point for our query. The interesting fact (which represents at the same time 
an important <i>caveat</i> for all wikipedia users!) is that the references for our specific genus "Allosaurus" 
are on wikipedia <u>much less 
exhaustive</u> than 
those we found for
its own  
suborder
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theropod#References">Theropoda</a>. 
Clearly an Allosauri-afecionado has invested a lot of time 
in this entry.
<br><br>
Time to change perspective and start our search from a DIRECTORY, not from a search engine. 
Of course we'll start with <a href="http://www.dmoz.org/Science/Earth_Sciences/Paleontology/">DMOZ</a>.
Let's dig: <a href="http://www.dmoz.org/Science/Earth_Sciences/Paleontology/Dinosaurs/">Dinosaurs</a>... 
no much here,  a quick glance at the results show it, we'll leave dmoz this time.
<br><br>
Let's try some nice web-<a href="combing.htm">combing</a>. I want to gather quickly the names (and web-addresses) of 
the most important journals, since I'll need them to assess the value of the Authorities, universities and 
books we have to find. A search for <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?ei=UTF-8&y=Search&vm=p&p=%22paleontology+journals%22">paleontology journals</a>, 
or even better, <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=%22vertebrate+paleontology+journals%22&y=Search&fr=&ei=UTF-8&vm=p">vertebrate 
paleontology journals</a>, should cut the mustard quickly, and indeed it does: a bunch of first 
results 
have been collected <a href="paleonthology_journals.htm">here</a>. Note that this 
<a href="paleonthology_journals.htm">long list of 'paleontological' journals</a> should 
be further used as a "springboard" in order to quickly gather further angles and be able to 
finetune your specific queries. An example is using three 'promising' titles in order to gather 
savvy sites: <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=%2Bjournals+%22Cretaceous+Research%22+Paleobiology+%22Revue+de+Paleobiologie%22&y=Search&fr=opera2&ei=UTF-8">+journals 
"Cretaceous Research" Paleobiology "Revue de Paleobiologie"</a> should help us to find further lists of journals, 
if needed, whereas <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&client=opera&rls=en&q=+%22Dinosaur+Paleontology%22+%22vertebrate+paleontology%22+&btnG=Search">"Dinosaur Paleontology" 
"vertebrate paleontology"</a> should quickly give us also non-journal links. Note how the searchscape 
changes if we add to this query <font color=blue>"The Society of Vertebrate Paleontology"</font>: 
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&client=opera&rls=en&q=%22The+Society+of+Vertebrate+Paleontology%22+%22Dinosaur+Paleontology%22+%22vertebrate+paleontology%22&btnG=Search">"The Society of Vertebrate Paleontology" "Dinosaur Paleontology" "vertebrate paleontology"</a>.
<br><br>I have decided to call 
this well-known trick: using elements of your previous query to broaden the next query, the <font color="navyblue">accumulative 
law of websearching</font>, since afaik there's no precise terminology for it.

<br>
<br>
Let's shift focus again. The point here is to use our "dinosaur*" example 
to show how you can quickly <u>but effectively</u> search the web for scholar material, bypassing all the 
commercial <i>guet-apens</i> we could encounter on the road.
<br>So use your fantasy when poking the web...

...you get the idea.

Now you should be able to carry on on your own... but there's still one point that needs to be addressed: 
<font color="navyblue">collation</font>.
<br><br><font color="navyblue">COLLATION</font><br>
Wikipedia is quite imprecise about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collation">collation</a>, and defines it 
as "the assembly of written information into a standard order". This is not true. Collation is the assembling 
of all the information you have found (not necessarily "written": why? Just because historically 
only texts have been collated?) integrating such information in a coherent presentation 
in order to offer the best possible result. This means among other things: 
eliminating doubles, choosing the best sources, choosing among variants, and so on.
<br><br><font color="navyblue">TAKING NOTES & SAVING SESSIONS</font><br>
Since you will need to "collate" all the material you will gather, how should you "prepare" it?<br>
There are two easy main options: saving sessions and taking notes.<br>
If you are using the browser <a href="http://www.opera.com/download/">Opera</a> 
(considered the quickest among the graphical browser and usually preferred by searchers), 
you can save the snippets of interest you find into a track of "bread crumbs"  using its 
<font color="navyblue">Notes</font> function. You highlight a target text found on a webpage, 
then right click on it and chose the "save to note" 
option (or press CTRL+SHIFT+C, like the copy command, but with an extra "shift"). To see all your notes just press 
CTRL+ALT+E (or click "tools" and then "notes"). The webpage you took the note from is automatically 
stored, together with the note. Hover over the note in order to see the URL or just double click on the 
note and reopen it (double clicking a note takes you back to where you got the note from).<br>
<u>Do not forget that you can edit those notes!</u><br> 
Clicking anywhere into the text of a note (on the right side), you can write and delete text, 
copy it to the clipboard, or insert it from there (works just like a text editor). 
You can also start an empty note (CTRL+ALT+E  and then click on "new note") 
and write in it whatever you fancy. 
<br>
This makes Notes a great tool <u>for preparing an excerpt from a webpage</u>.
<br> 
When, for example, the information you need is "hidden" in a lengthy piece of prose, 
the Note function can be used to jot down just a few headwords as you read. 
That way you don't have to re-read the entire document if you need it again, and you 
can later use the snippets you highlighted in your wordprocessor.<br>
This makes Notes a very useful function for students! 
(Notes are great for saving forum posts, draft submissions, login details and eReceipts). 
<br>
Finally do learn how to create FOLDERS inside your notes, and then just shift the new notes inside 
the appropriate folder. When preparing this paper I had just four folders: 
"journals", "tips", "universities" and "alltherest", and collation was easy afterwards.
<br>
<br>
You can also (and you should) save your global search <font color="navyblue">session</font>, freezing a given 
moment of your search activity in time. I usually name sessions with the current date and time, 
something like "110208_1500", but you could name the session you have started following this paper -say-
 "dinosaurs".
Get used to save your sessions when searching, it will be a life saver later, when collating results.

<table width=88%><tR><td>
<br><font size=+1> Readers should learn to
<a href="evaluate.htm">evaluate</a> what they find on the web, which is imperative:
Evaluation refers to the process of analyzing (and ordering) the data you have gathered  
in such a way to determine whether 
you are  carrying out effectively your searches, and the extent to which you are 
achieving your stated objectives and anticipated results.
<br><br>
There are many tricks you can use: one of the simplest I know of is to search for images, not 
only for texts: 
you can easily "rewind" your images search back to interesting SITES <u>starting from the images you found</u>. 
This is a very interesting trick, since it allows you to use your "visual evaluation" skills.
The sites you'll click onto are bound to be (most probably) 
interesting BECAUSE you can very quickly evaluate the worthiness of the images from the thumbnails, and 
hence the worthiness of the site itself. Here an example for <a href="http://images.google.com/images?client=opera&rls=en&q=Apatosaurus&sourceid=opera&ie=UTF-8&oe=utf-8&um=1&sa=N&tab=wi">Apatosaurus</a>, 
where would you click?<br>
More on  images searching <a href="how_to_research.htm#images">below</a>.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, finding journals and texts is often 
easier than evaluating them. This is due to the fact that we are searching a matter that we 
don't yet master: we are "learning as we go", so to say. Hence we have to rely to what other 
people assert (which means we have the added need to evaluate the "authority" of such people); or we have 
to rely on our own feelings (often useful, at times misguiding); or we have 
to relate on the <a href="evalessa.htm#rece">old evaluation rules</a> like, for books and texts, their
<font color="navyblue">intended audience</font>  and the 
<font color="navyblue">purpose of the information</font> they deliver.
<br><br>Let's try for instance to find the best universities for our dinosauria. There cannot be 
a "best university for paleontology": different universities have 
different strengths in different areas of paleontology, 
usually depending on the interests of individual professors. And your interests also matter. 
You can find out what professors 
<u>are interesting to you</u> by reading their published papers in the <a href="paleonthology_journals.htm">professional journals</a> that we have 
found above, but with any journal we have a further -more global- problem: is the content freely available (as it should 
and is more and more frequent) or is that content still "jailed" inside an obsolete proprietary database?<br>
Fortunately, many journals (yet by all means not all) now offer at least in part complete access 
to the papers they publish. Here a couple of examples:
<br> 

<a href="http://jpaleontol.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/search?field_name=fulltext&field_value=allosaurus&andorexacttitle=and&author1=&fmonth=Jul&fyear=1927&tmonth=Jan&tyear=2008&RESULTFORMAT=1&hits=10&sortspec=relevance&sendit=Search">Journal of 
Paleontology</a> (some articles can be retrieved as full texts), 
<a href="http://paleobiol.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/search?field_name=fulltext&field_value=allosaurus&andorexacttitle=and&author1=&fmonth=Jan&fyear=1975&tmonth=Jan&tyear=2008&RESULTFORMAT=1&hits=10&sortspec=relevance&sendit=Search">Paleobiology</a>
(some articles can be retrieved as full texts) and
<a href="http://palaios.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/search?field_name=fulltext&field_value=allosaurus&andorexacttitle=and&author1=&fmonth=Feb&fyear=1986&tmonth=Feb&tyear=2008&RESULTFORMAT=1&hits=10&sortspec=relevance&sendit=Search">Palaios</a> 
 (some articles can be retrieved as full texts).
 <br>
 <a href="http://www.vertpaleo.org/publications/index.cfm">Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology</a>
  (articles <u>cannot</u> be retrieved as full texts).<br>
 It is worth pointing out that even when searching a journal outside the 
 english speaking area, for instance a FRENCH journal, 
 like the <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/07533969">Annales de paleonthologie</a>, 
 you are nowadays bound to find most
 articles in english. This is important for your decisions about future studies, since in the European union 
 almost all countries 
 that have a "small" language (Danemark, Holland, Finland...) offer more and more university level 
 courses in english. So you <u>are not confined</u> to the UK and Ireland&nbsp;:-) 

<br><br>But the fact that a journal has a closed database doesn't mean you have to renounce to it: 
even the content of those journals that still follow the <a href="deepweb_searching.htm#bago">obsolete and 
absurd "pay per view" model</a>, instead 
of publishing the full content on the web, 
  will be anyway available for free in most good libraries and university and 
 college libraries.
 <br><br>Consulting the journals you'll be able to fond out which universities are most likely to offer 
 a good paleontological preparation, which could be useful  
  if you are considering studying later in 
a paleontological faculty. In that case -again- you should make an effort to contact those 
professors whose work has interested you directly, by letter, email or phone, and arrange to visit their departments.
Do not hesitate: in general so few people do ever care about their work, that you can be assured they will bend backwards 
in order to help you with 
good advice and suggestions. 
This will help you learn more about graduate programs and possibilities.
<br><br>So how do we find the "best universities"? Well we could first gather which universities 
have a paleontology faculty (<a href="http://www.altavista.com/web/results?itag=ody&q=university+NEAR+paleontology&kgs=1&kls=0">university NEAR 
paleontology</a>). But the "journals" approach is less biased and more rewarding.
After a quick glance at the journals we can tentatively draw some conclusions (we have excluded universities 
that might be very good but do not offer english courses):<br> 
In the States the <a href="http://www.sas.upenn.edu/earth/graduate.htm">University of Pennsylvania</a> seems to be 
an excellent choice for anything related to paleontology, especially if the critters you want 
to work with are dinosaurs. 
This university, one of the very few places in the States where you can actually take a 
degree in paleobiology, has the oldest tradition of paleo education in the New World.

<br><br>
In the European Union 
the <a href="http://dinobase.gly.bris.ac.uk/index.htm">university of Bristol</a> seems to have good paleobiologists. 


<br><br>
Elsewhere the Moscow university for <a href="http://www.geol.msu.ru/english/index.html">Geology</a> and 
<a href="http://www.geol.msu.ru/deps/paleont/">Paleonthology</a> has been considered "the best university & faculty forever".

but exhaustive in detail; a "must have".

Benton, Michael J. (2004). <font color="navyblue" size=+2><i>Vertebrate Palaeontology</i></font>, Third Edition. Blackwell Publishing, 472 pp., 
A basic textbook on vertebrate paleontology by a Bristol's professor, three editions,  
published in 1990, 1997, and 2005, designed 
for paleontology graduate courses in biology and geology as well as for the interested layman.

<li>
Euan Clarkson’s <font color="navyblue" size=+2><i>Invertebrate Palaeontology and Evolution</i></font>
 (published first by George Allen & Unwin and now by Blackwells) 
 has for many years 
 led the field in palaeontology textbooks for undergraduate courses,. 
 Although in recent years a number of new teaching texts have been published, none 
 can rival Clarkson.

<li>Milsom Clare & Rigby Sue (2004). <font color="navyblue" size=+2><i>Fossils at a Glance</i></font>: 
"a solid addition to any paleo library".
</li>

<li>R. McNeill Alexander, <font color="navyblue" size=+2><i>Dynamics of dinosaurs and other extinct giants</i></font>, as the title implies ("extinct 
giants" is clearly appealing to the laymen), this is a 'reduced' work from this expert (of course we 
can <a href="http://a9.com/%2Bpublications%20%22McNeill%20Alexander%22">quickly find out 
what this professor ever published</a>&nbsp;:-)<br>"In this book 
Alexander  exercises his considerable expertise in engineering; he tackles questions of dinosaur weight, 
gait, agility, behavior, and metabolism from a mechanical perspective, and emphasizes methods a paleontologist 
can use to infer or calculate whole animal structure and function from bones and trackways. 
Flying and marine reptiles and giant birds and mammals are also included. For the intelligent 
lay reader who wonders how scientific reconstructions of fossil animals can be created; 
and for the professional seeking an approachable version of topics covered in Alexander's more technical works".

<table width=88%><tR><td>
<br><font size=+1>Images searching is an art apart, therefore I'll simply refer you to 
fravia's very useful <a href="images.htm">section</a>. For our dinosauria, however I would 
try the 
following queries:

<ol><li><a href="http://images.google.com/images?client=opera&rls=en&q=Aeolosaurus&sourceid=opera&ie=UTF-8&oe=utf-8&um=1&sa=N&tab=wi">Aeolosaurus</a>
note... <ul><li> how a specific species, here "Aeolosaurus" ("wind reptile", alluding to the windy Patagonian 
region of southern Argentina where the fossil was found), gives us less "noisy" results; however 
most images seems to be just one and the same (Lucas Fiorelli's)
</li></ul></li>
<li><a href="http://images.google.com/images?um=1&hl=en&client=opera&rls=en&q=Titanosauridae&btnG=Search+Images">Titanosauridae</a>
note... 
<ul><li> how enlarging the image query to a specific group, here "Titanosauria" (titanic reptiles), gives us 
 more interesting results; </li></ul></li>
<li>A simple query like <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&client=opera&rls=en&hs=txm&q=%22Where+to+Find+Great+Dinosaur+Pictures%22&btnG=Search">
"Where to Find Great Dinosaur Pictures"</a> will bring us at once to 
<a href="http://www.search4dinosaurs.com/">http://www.search4dinosaurs.com/</a>. Now, applying even 
the simplest evaluation parameters, it is obvious that this site is utterly unscientific. Yet it has 
gather a bonanza of pictures that could still be useful if used <i>cum grano salis</i>.
</li></ul>
</li></ol>
Quickly scanning the web for images inside generic "dinosaurs" pirated books, 
the reader will realize that the available literature (ease of availability being unfortunately, on the web,  
directly proportional to "celebrity") is nothing
to write home about, especially if 
compared with the "scholar" results we were able to fetch 
with the approaches described 
<a href="how_to_research.htm#inven">above</a> (for instance: <a href="http://www.plesiosaur.com/database/references/hawkins/plate03.html">here</a>). 
However, some less "scientific" 
images-oriented books are easily available on the web, probably because they 
satisfy the unwasheds' desires for nice images. 
<br>
In less than 15 minutes (February 2008, YMMV), <a href="books.htm">with the usual</a> techniques, I could find and 
download for free  the following books: 
<prE>Norman_Dinosaurs-A Very Short Introduction-0192804197.pdf
dinosaursthefactfile.pdf
Scientific.American.Special.Edition.Dinosaurs.and.Other.Monsters.pdf
</pre>
This last book has many interesting images, but they still lack the "expressiveness" I would like to have when writing 
a dissertation or a paper on such matters (this is just me, YMMocV). 
<br><br>
<table><tr><td><font size=+1>
See: everything depends from the KIND of images you are searching. As stated, if you want scientific images 
you are better served by the images you'll find perusing the <a href="paleonthology_journals.htm">journals</a> 
we have combed, but if you would be more satisfied with less exact but MUCH more 
impressive (if probably a tag unscientific) images of our dinosauria, you might also shift the seeking focus onto 
some side alleys. For instance 
the most able among dinosaur "comics" 
designers:  <a href="http://www.darkhorse.com/search/search.php?sstring=Ricardo+Delgado">Ricardo Delgado</a> 
(found through the "age of reptiles" search above, images: here right   
and on the <a href="paleonthology_journals.htm">journals</a> page). I suppose all his books 
must have landed in the public domain, since 
you can easily find all of them
on the web for free in their "comic book archive files" format.<br><br>
<font color=blue>A small digression about .cba, .cbz, .cbr or .cbt</font> formats 
<bR>If you want to seek "comic" books on the web, be aware that they will be most probably stored in <font color=blue>
.cba, .cbz, .cbr or .cbt</font> format  
(Comic Book Archive files) which consist of a series of image files archived in ZIP, RAR, 
or more rarely TAR or ACE formats with the filename extension renamed to .cbz, .cbr, .cbt and .cba respectively. 
such  .cba, .cbz, .cbr or .cbt files typically contain PNG or JPEG files. Occasionally GIF, BMP, 
and TIFF are seen. You can open them directly, in linux, 
using evince or just rename them to their respective archive format and open all images in a folder.

<tr><td><font size=+1><br>We think that the approaches described above should be enough to allow anyone to 
start collecting 
almost anything the web has to offer on the target "Dinosauria"... of course the real purpose of 
this paper is NOT to explain how to specifically search for "Dinosauria", 
but rather to show some useful approaches 
that searchers could use and apply for all sort of targets.
 <br>
<br>Let's finally resume what we were able to see today: 
<ul><li>
How to start with wikipedia and google, and some limits of both wikipedia (individual specific 
entries might be more exhaustive than individual global entries) and google (stale indexes);
</li><li>
The importance of "negative" parameters to avoid noise (<font color="navyblue">dinosaur  
-creationist -creationism</font>);
</li><li>
The possibility of limiting scholar searches to <font color="navyblue">.edu</font> sites;
</li><li>
The fact that the open directory DMOZ (usually highly considered by searchers) in this case doesn't help much;
</li><li>How to quickly prepare a list of "authoritative" Journals 
 using journal titles to find other journals (the "accumulative" law of websearching);
</li><li>
How to quickly find out what a professor ever published;
</li><li>
Some examples of using  <u>fantasy</u> when poking the web with queries;
</li><li>
How to collate your results (Opera: taking notes and saving sessions);
</li><li>
How to use an image search in order to find new sites 
and evaluate quickly the worthiness of such sites;
</li><li>How to (try to) bypass
 the "deep web" classical problem of closed databases and jailed information;

</li><li>
Some universities that could be useful, approaching professors;
</li><li>
Establishing a first quick bibliography;

</li><li>
How to search for images and the inverse proportion between ease of availability and lack of "celebrity";

</li><li>
Comic formats (a digression);

</li><li>
Real-life addresses for social engineering purposes;
</li><li>Mailing lists and other
 bizarre (but useful)  resources.
</li></ul>
