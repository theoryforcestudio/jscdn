You may have seen, in the <a href="basic.htm">basic</a> part 
of searchlores, how important it is to apply (and acquire) a <SPAN STYLE="color: black; 
background: yellow">systematic approach</span> 
in order to evaluate 
the <a href="tools.htm">tools</a> you will
use for searching, and understand what they will allow you to fetch - or keep
you from fetching -   <u><b>before</b></u> even starting your queries. 
<br>
Well, that's nothing. 
It is actually even more important for you to acquire and apply
a systematic approach when 
<u><b>evaluating</b></u> the (many) documents, clues and results that you will 
gather as a result of
your (hopefully well-prepared) queries. 
<br><br>
See, the relation between the small tiny <a target=_top HREF="terminology.htm#termi_s">signal</A>
 you are searching for on the deep web 
and the broad loud <a target=_top HREF="terminology.htm#termi_n">noise</A> you will always fetch "around it" makes it 
very important that you learn how to filter... how to "strain" your results. And you will 
have to do this quickly and competently, even when searching matters  and fields 
in which you are no 
expert. Luckily there are some general rules that you can follow.
<br><br>
Since I had the honour to have had myself an incredible expert in this field 
- as my teacher - for many years, I'll use the following simple 'lore' approach 
to underline the importance of a correct evaluation when searching...<bR><bR>

<br><font size=+1>Old techniques can be

<i>...Yep, I remember Professor Frjthiof Sielaff's lessons about scripts' evaluation lores... let me state 
that those old lessons are VERY IMPORTANT for anyone that searches the web nowadays... no, I will not 
"state" anything (it would contradict the very purpose of this very teaching)... just 
read the following "lore" and judge by yourself...</i>
<br><br>

<hr width=45% ALIGN=left>  <font size=+1>
<IMG align=left valign=top width=9 height=40 SRC="images/dot_green.gif">We sat 
there waiting and <i>ziemlich gespannt</i>, January, quite cold in Berlin, but, after all, 
that was the reason we were there: Sielaff was still teaching, against all political odds.<br>And he came, with his 
classical quarter of an hour "academic delay"... 
 He came "<i>herein</i>" leaning on one side, because he carried at least a dozen books 
under his left arm, and then he sat down, without even looking at us, and 
let all his books fall on the teacher's desk.<br> 
Mind you, this was the most cherished post-university course 
for historians of the early middle ages in Europe in those days, so 
you can imagine how silent and attentive we all (students from all over Europe) were...<br>He still did not 
look at us. 
"These books" - he began - "deal all, more or less, with 
the same subject: a history of Danemark in the middle ages. Now please try to supersede the 
subject: actually the subject could be completely different, it would not matter in the least <i>per se</i>: the point 
is that you should <i>bei Gelegenheit</i> learn how to EVALUATE all kind 
of books <u>BEFORE</u> 
buying and/or reading 
them (to do it <u>afterwards</u> is not easy either, by the way, 
but at least <u>that kind</u> of evaluation requires more obvious skills)."
<br>Sielaff looked sharply at his audience. "I imagine" - he said - "that you already know 
that most of the books... and data... around us are next to useless, don't you?"<br>
Dunnow about the others, but this took me by surprise: I had always thought, naïvely enough, 
that anything that was published must have had some sort of "value".<br>
"This book..." - Sielaff began, taking the first book out of his pile - "...is titled, quite 
appropriately for our today example: '<i>History of Danemark in the Middle ages</i>'..." - he paused and looked 
at us - "...unfortunately, the Author, as stated by himself in the introduction, does 
not know danish at all, therefore... " - he suddendly 
threw the book on a far corner of the teaching 
desk in disgust.<br><br>
<center><font color=blue>YOU CANNOT WRITE ABOUT SOMETHING WHICH IS 
LANGUAGE-RELATED IF YOU DO NOT KNOW THAT LANGUAGE</font>
<br><i>Obvious but very often underestimated</i><hr>
</center>   
<br><IMG align=left valign=top width=9 height=40 SRC="images/dot_green.gif">
"This book, on the other hand..." - he continued, picking another book from his pile - "... which is 
titled '<i>Danemark 
between 500 and 1200</i>' has been 
written by an Author that actually does happen to know danish... unfortunately (for him, on the other side 
quite 
fortunately for 
those among us that want to appreciate books 
like this <i>on the fly</i>) the same Author wrote -&nbsp;before this book&nbsp;- a 
book titled '<i>Cactusses and other desert's plants</i>' and, should that not be enough for you, he 
wrote - a short time after having published 
the book I am helding right now in my hand - another book titled 
'<i>Aquarium techniques 
for home and profit</i>'.<br>The book flow flattering on the far corner on the desk, where it hit the previous one.<br><br>
<center><font color=blue>YOU CANNOT WRITE ABOUT UNRELATED 
THINGS AND PRETEND YOU REALLY KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT ANYONE OF THEM</font>
<br><i>Obvious but very often underestimated</i><hr>
</center>     
<br><IMG align=left valign=top width=9 height=40 SRC="images/dot_green.gif">"I am sure 
you begin to understand, now..." - he said - "...but let's continue, because 
there is MUCH more to understand and reverse... here is another book: '<i>Danemark in the middle 
ages</i>' - and he fished a third 
book from his pile - "that has been written by someone that definitely 
knows danish, that only worked on danish 
history of the middle ages, and that happens to be a recognized authority in such matters" 
- he paused and 
then throw the book disgusted on the "crap" side of his desk - "I know you wont like what I will 
now say" - he added - "but it is quite important nevertheless: the Author wrote this book when he was 
only THIRTY years old!" - in fact we were all still approaching thirty ourselves 
and therefore more or less 
speechless - "I fear you'll probably don't dig it right now, but believe me: 
if you want to be really 
sure someone knows anything about what he's writing about -&nbsp;especially in 
complex sciences like early medieval history&nbsp;-, you 
wait until he is AT LEAST fifty years old, 
and even in that case you should by all means take GREAT care: 
most of the so-called "experts" 
are oft enough just releasing hot air bubbles. This has nothing to do with 
danish history specifically, of course... it happens anywhere, anyhow, anyabout..."<br>
<br><br>
<center>
<font color=blue>YOU CANNOT TRUST ANYONE THAT DID NOT SPEND 
A RELEVANT AMOUNT OF TIME ON A SINGLE AND SPECIFIC THEME</font><br>
<i>Obvious but very often underestimated</i><hr>
</center>  
<br><IMG align=left valign=top width=9 height=40 SRC="images/dot_green.gif">
"You see..." - continued Sielaff - "...the fact that the previous author worked a lot 
on a single subject may be 
relevant for the books he wrote / will have written <u>at the END</u> of his career. 
But this does not guarantee 
nothing at all about the books he may have written 
at the beginning. And now we come to this article: 
'<i>About mediaeval danemark</i>' which was written by an expert on danish medieval 
history, who was  fifty himself at the time of writing. The article appeared in november 
1982 on a 
university monthly collection..." - silence followed, we were trying to guess - "...ahem, 
I repeat: it appeared <u>in november</u> on a monthly..." - more silence: we didn't know 
what to say - "...ok: if you don't know it yet, then you better learn it right now: 
monthly publications 
are tricky -&nbsp;especially university ones.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They actually <u>HAVE</u> 
to publish their 12 issues year after year in order to survive... 
and get public money for the following years... yet the quality 
varies considerably, and though 
it may be relatively easy to find  some sound and interesting material for the first, say, 
five or six months, 
you'll have to scratch the bottom of the 'Topf' 
to be able to fill and publish  all 12 issues... therefore, my dear students, everything 
published 'from september onwards' should be regarderd with suspect... mind you: it does not 
MEAN that the stuff <u>is</u> crap, it is only LESS PROBABLE that you'll have some  
outstanding work there..."

<font color=blue>YOU SHOULD ALWAYS TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE ECONOMIC 
RATIOS BEHIND ANY PUBLISHING EFFORT</font><br>
<i>You should always take into account  economic ratios behind <u>anything</u>, btw...</i><hr>
</center>  
<br><IMG align=left valign=top width=9 height=40 SRC="images/dot_green.gif">
 
 "And now we are approaching the real 'kern' of today's session." - Sielaff yawned - "Here you have another book: 
 <i>History of Danemark through the middle ages</i>." - He raised a hand holding a thick book 
 from his pile. - "This was written by a recognized expert of danish history, towards the end 
 of his life, building on many essays he wrote before on the same argument. It was published 
 by the most important danish editor, translated in German, English and French."<br> - A small pause -
 "It has no footnotes, only endnotes."<br> Sielaff coughed, smiling sadly. - 
 "This basically means that you should 'believe' the historical reconstruction of the Author, instead 
 of having the possibility - and the ease - to confute 'at every step' his writings."<br>
"So even the 'formatting' of your target resource is important as well, and please note that - most of the time -
said formatting will NOT be casual."<br>
 He threw the book away in disgust.

<br>


<br><IMG align=left valign=top width=9 height=40 SRC="images/dot_green.gif">
 
"Today's 'proseminar' is almost finished."<br>"Guess you may enjoy this book." - Sielaff held in his hands the 
last book of the pile.<br>   "Titled      "<i>A short history of Danemark in the middle ages</i>" this book 
was written by a recognized expert of the matter, 60 years old at the time of writing, has footnotes, uses 
correctly the sources... as far as I can judge... seems 'in ordnung', has all the characteristics of 
a sound book..."  - Sielaff opened the book 
and sniffed among the pages. - "It even smells good."<br>Sielaff's head jerked back. - "Yet 
you should NOT trust  its assertions, not in the least: Check the sources yourselves, confute the 'truths' 
 and the 'discoveries' of this Author... think at the possible alternative interpretations..." - Sielaff hands waved 
 in the air. - "It's only WORDS! Never forget it: books, knowledge... just a cobweb of words, behind them, often enough: nothing.<br>
 A cobweb of theories, that's "science". It's up to you to dispel it. <br> Sielaff's eyes 
pierced the audience. - "A critical mind, that's your only weapon inside the dark forests of 
bogus knowledge you will have to cross again and again, your critical mind... never ever allow 
it to get dull."
<br>
Sielaff put  the book down,  closed it gently,  and left.
