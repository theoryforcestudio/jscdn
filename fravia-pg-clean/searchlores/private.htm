<br>
Excuse my English, please, which is my third language, 
and please note that I'm not sure I'll always be able to be politically correct.
Also -as you can see- no powerpoint in my talks: there's no need to turn everything into a sales pitch, 
and with powerpoint even the few pre-chewed "ideas", 
hidden inside the bambinesque noise, are simplified to the point that they become 
redundant and unclear.<br><br>
 The purpose of this talk is to show you how to search effectively the web, and hence 
 give you <font color=blue>cosmic power</font>, no more and no less.  In only one hour we'll be able  to 
 examinate just a broad palette of searching approaches. Let's hope that your attention span is good enough, and that 
 you'll be later able to work by yourself, in order to learn much more on your own: <i>Probieren geht 
 ï¿½ber studieren</i>, duh, yet without your own work and application  
 most of you will just remain the poor "one word" searchers that they are.
<br>
<br>It would be a pity!  
 Once you know how to search the web, 
 the entire human knowledge will become available to you.<br><br>
Enough blabbering: let's begin from the beginning. Using <a href="google.htm">google</a>, we can see how a simple "moronical" query like
 <br>
 <a href="http://www.google.com/search?&rls=en&q=%22index.of%22+warez&num=100">"index.of" warez</a> 
 has your target 
 signal 
 submerged under such a heavy commercial noise to be next to useless. In fact people create on their servers many 
 <font color=blue>Index of/archiv/warez</font> or  <font color=blue>Index of/archiv/porn</font> subdirectories  
 just in order to attract some (moronical) traffic&nbsp;:-)
 <br>
 The <font color=blue>index.of</font> querystring is one of the oldest tricks used to bypass the commercial vultures, in the hope 
 to  fetch directly the targets you are seeking. 
 <br>
 It still works, btw: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?&rls=en&q=playmates+index.of&num=100&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8">playmates index.of</a> 
 will indeed give you some 
 good results. But the commercial beasts and the search engines' spammers (that call themselves <font color=blue>SEO</font>s) 
 incorporated a long time ago this <font color=blue>index.of</font> 
 string in their scam pages, so you cannot rely on this querystring -alone- anymore.
 <br><br>
 So what should we use instead?<br>
 Well, a query like the following one should cut some more mustard (In case people should look for software on the web instead of buying it):
 <br>
 <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&hl=en&lr=&q=%28%22wares%22+OR+%22warez%22+OR+%22appz%22+OR+%22gamez%22+OR+%22abandoned%22+OR+%22pirate%22+OR+%22war3z%22%29+%28%22download%22+OR+%22ftp%22+OR+%22index+of%22+OR+%22cracked%22+OR+%22release%22+OR+%22full%22%29+%28%22nfo%22+OR+%22rar%22+OR+%22zip%22+OR+%22ace%22%29&btnG=Search">("wares" OR "warez" OR "appz" OR "gamez" OR "abandoned" OR "pirate" OR "war3z") ("download" OR "ftp" OR "index of" OR "cracked" OR "release" OR "full") ("nfo" OR "rar" OR "zip" OR "ace")</a>
<br>Of course this is useful when used with a specific target NAME: 
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&hl=en&lr=&q=teleport.pro+%28%22wares%22+OR+%22warez%22+OR+%22appz%22+OR+%22gamez%22+OR+%22abandoned%22+OR+%22pirate%22+OR+%22war3z%22%29+%28%22download%22+OR+%22ftp%22+OR+%22index+of%22+OR+%22cracked%22+OR+%22release%22+OR+%22full%22%29+%28%22nfo%22+OR+%22rar%22+OR+%22zip%22+OR+%22ace%22%29&btnG=Search">teleport.pro ("wares" OR "warez" OR "appz" OR "gamez" OR "abandoned" OR "pirate" OR "war3z") ("download" OR "ftp" OR "index of" OR "cracked" OR "release" OR "full") ("nfo" OR "rar" OR "zip" OR "ace")</a>, 
which confirms the paramount importance of NAMES on the Web.

<br>

<br><hr><br>
 Here another nice mp3 querystring, just smash it inside google: 
<br>
<font color=blue>imagine "snd *.mp3 *-*-2005 *:* *.*m" OR "snd *.mp3 *-*-2005 *:* *.*k" OR "snd *.mp3 *-*-2005 *:* *.*"</font><br>
 and obtain the following link: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=ISO-8859-1&q=imagine++%22snd+*.mp3+*-*-2005+*%3A*+*.*m%22+OR+%22snd+*.mp3+*-*-2005+*%3A*+*.*k%22+OR+%22snd+*.mp3+*-*-2005+*%3A*+*.*%22++&btnG=Search">http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=ISO-8859-1&q=imagine++%22snd+*.mp3+*-*-2005+*%3A*+*.*m%22+OR+%22snd+*.mp3+*-*-2005+*%3A*+*.*k%22+OR+%22snd+*.mp3+*-*-2005+*%3A*+*.*%22++&btnG=Search</a> <br>
 Change <font color=blue>imagine</font> to boogie, dylan, garfunkel, mendelssohn, mozart or whatnots. Change <font color=blue>2005</font> to 2004 (or earlier) for a different (but possibly more stale) search.
<br>Look at the query: 
can you understand WHY this query works?
<br>
<br><hr><br>

<br>
These above are just examples, and using just one of the <a href="main.htm">main</a> search engines: <a href="google.htm">Google</a>, one of
the most important, but (and hence) also one of the most abused search engines. 
<br><br>Always remember that 
the main search engines (at the moment the most important ones are google, yahoo, msn and teoma) cover -at best- <a href="private.htm#coverage">just a third</a>  
of the whole web... <IMG SRC="images/bulletr.gif" ALT="red" align="bottom" valign="bottom" WIDTH="13"
HEIGHT="13">&nbsp;
<br><br>
So the problem is to wade  through the slimy commercial morasses of the web, which were 
made specifically "ad captandum vulgus", and to quickly "cut" 
this useless ballast in order to find our targets.
<br>
<br>We'll use google a lot as an example today, but 
we'll examine  various different ways to fetch  your targets "by hand". I say "manually" because that's what 
we are going to do <u>for pedagocical reasons</u>.<br>Real seekers try to 
automate the process as much as possible and usually employ ad hoc <a href="bots.htm">bots</a> to do the gritty digging. But that's 
for later, first the basics.<br><br>
Let's first have a short look at what  <a href="private.htm#structure">the web looks like from a searcher's point of view</a>.
<br>
<font color=blue>Outside linkers</font> are fetched through klebing (and stalking and social engineering), 
<font color=blue>the bulk</font> and the <font color=blue>outside linked </font> 
through <a href="private.htm#combing">combing</a> and short and long term seeking, the hidden and commercial databases through 
password breaking or <a href="private.htm#guessing">guessing</a>, social engineering or, more simply, just seeking 
databases' 
hardcoded passwords  (ï¿½ la 
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&safe=off&as_qdr=all&q=borland+%22politically+correct%22+interbase&btnG=Search">Borland Interbase's 
"politically correct"</a>) on the web. <br>Here is for instance one of these lists: 

  <a href="http://www.searchlores.org/defpasslist1.htm">defpasslist1.htm</a>
<br><br>
In fact the web was made for SHARING information, not for "hoarding" nor for "selling" it. And 
it was made for solidity: its structure was made 
in order to resist a possible nuclear attack. It will resist even the commercial beasts that 
have tried to bury real useful information under tons of commercial crap, aggressive commercial 
porn sites and an avalanche of silly and useless advertisements.<br>
Learning how to search, you'll be able to "cut" through the commercial pudding and morasses and 
fetch quickly (or relatively quickly) your target jewels.
<br>
<br>

But to "cut" the Web you'll need first of all  a SWORD with a sharp blade: a capable and quick browser. 
That's the first and foremost 
step. MSIE, Microsoft Internet explorer is a no-no-no, too buggy, bloated and prone to all sort of nasty attacks. The 
two current "philosophical  schools" are either Firefox or Opera... which is the one I am using now.<br><br>
Whichever of the two "real" browsers you use, no sword will suffice without a SHIELD. And your shield, 
and a mighty one, is <font color=blue>proxomitron</font>. <br>
Proxomitron is a very powerful tool. Its power lies 
in its ability to <font color=blue>rewrite webpages on the fly</font>, <font color=blue>filter communications between 
your computer and the web servers of the sites you visit</font>, and to <font color=blue>allow easy management of external proxy use</font>.
<br>
Here is a 
link to an old, but very good essay about proxomitron basic installation: <a href="anony_8.htm">anony_8.htm</a>, and a link 
to 
another essay, <a href="proxopro_1.html">Oncle Faf goes inside proxomitron</a> about further finetuning.... Let's sum it up: 
<i>"Only morons 'just do it' without <a target=_top href="http://www.searchlores.org/zipped/ProxN44.zip">Proxomitron</a>."</i>


<br><br>
<font color=blue>A word of warning</font>: You'll most probably forget most of the things you'll learn today rather quickly, since 
nowadays most 
young people (and many elder ones as well) after having been heavily bombarded by advertisements 
from their birth onwards, have an attention span of just a few minutes and a memory as weak 
as an autumn leaf. But hopefully you'll gather today <font color=blue>the basics</font> of searching correctly the web. You may 
even want to test your skills, afterwards, on your own, on some <a href="private.htm#assignements">assignements</a>. 
<br><br>So, in case you forget, 
for instance, how to quickly find any mp3 on the fly, you'll be able to use your <a href="combing.htm">combing</a> 
knowledge to quickly find on the web 
many searchers who will teach you how to find mp3 rather quickly. Or maybe even <b>their</b> teachers&nbsp;:-)

</center><br><br>
GUESSING is a very important art for seekers.
Here two 'images-related' examples of the "guessing" approach:<br>
<br>

1)
<br><br>
</center>
  <IMG SRC="images/BMPD_03884_0048601T.JPG"><br> <br>
   <a target=_top href="http://www.adforum.com/adfolio/search.asp">A database and a search engine for advertisements</a>, 
   completely free until recently, you could enlarge (and copy) 
   any picture and watch  
   any ad-spot. <br>
Advertisements from Austria to Zimbabwe. Very useful  
   for advertisement reversing pourposes.<br>
   <br>
   For instance: <a target=_top href="http://media3.adforum.com/zrIf58670C/B/BM/BMPD_03884/BMPD_03884_0048601T.JPG">http://media3.adforum.com/zrIf58670C/B/BM/BMPD_03884/BMPD_03884_0048601T.JPG</a>, 
   an English volkswagen advertisement.<br><br>
   Alas, the clowns are no longer free. Let's see what we can do.<br>
    <a target=_top href="http://media3.adforum.com/zrIf58670C/B/BM/BMPD_03884/BMPD_03884_0048601T.JPG">Let's isolate the image</a>, and now 
    let's play the guessing game, because we don't really want to [shudder] pay advertisers in order to see 
    their crap, do we? <br>Now we notice that <font color=blue>BMPD_03884_0048601T.JPG</fonT> has a "t" inside. 
It may be "t" for tiny. <br>Then we may have "w" for wide and maybe also "a" for art&nbsp;:-)
<br>
    (<a target=_top href="http://media3.adforum.com/zrIf58670C/B/BM/BMPD_03884/BMPD_03884_0048601W.JPG">http://media3.adforum.com/zrIf58670C/B/BM/BMPD_03884/BMPD_03884_0048601W.JPG</a>...see?
     <a target=_top href="http://media3.adforum.com/zrIf58670C/B/BM/BMPD_03884/BMPD_03884_0048601A.JPG">http://media3.adforum.com/zrIf58670C/B/BM/BMPD_03884/BMPD_03884_0048601AJPG</a>...q.e.d.<br>

   <br><br><font size=+1>
   The web was made for SHARING, not for hoarding and not for selling. It's very STRUCTURE will deliver 
searchers whatever they are looking for.</font><br>
<br><br>But the web is really deep.
   For instance, if you study advertisement debunking, you may also want to take account of the EVOLUTION of advertisement, and here is 
   where sites like <a target=_top href="http://scriptorium.lib.duke.edu/adaccess/browse.html">http://scriptorium.lib.duke.edu/adaccess/browse.html</a> (1911-1956) 
   may come handy. 
   
<br><br>
<br><br>
2) 


<a href="http://www.acclaimimages.com/_gallery/_pages/">http://www.acclaimimages.com/_gallery/_pages/</a>

As you can see, when you click on one of these links, for instance on this <a href="http://www.acclaimimages.com/_gallery/_pages/0153-0512-1500-1119.html">construction 
crane</a>, you get a useless small and watermarked image: <a href="http://www.acclaimimages.com/_gallery/_SM/0153-0512-1500-1119_SM.jpg">http://www.acclaimimages.com/_gallery/_SM/0153-0512-1500-1119_SM.jpg</a>.<br>
Now note the STRUCTURE of this address: http://www.acclaimimages.com/_gallery/<font color=blue>_SM</font>/0153-0512-1500-1119<font color=blue>_SM</font>.jpg<br>
That <font color=blue>_SM</font> must mean <font color=blue>SMALL</font>, and in this case, also, watermarked.<br>
Some simple guessing (and some experience) will prove once again that the web was made for SHARING, not for hoarding and 
not for selling: as you can see the 'similar pictures', below, have the following structure: <a href="http://www.acclaimimages.com/_gallery/_TN/0153-0512-1500-1119_TN.jpg">http://www.acclaimimages.com/_gallery/_TN/0153-0512-1500-1119_TN.jpg</a>, 
hence <font color=blue>_TN</font> must be <font color=blue>TINY</font>.<br>
Let's first try <a href="http://www.acclaimimages.com/_gallery/_BG/0153-0512-1500-1119_BG.jpg">http://www.acclaimimages.com/_gallery/_BG/0153-0512-1500-1119_BG.jpg</a>: 
<font color=blue>BG</font> for BIG<br>
Ahi, ahi: "<i>was not found on this server</i>". In fact, I'll stop here and 
let <font color=blue>you</font> find out -I mean, guess out- the correct character 
sequence as an assignement&nbsp;:-)
<br>But we can still eliminate the watermarks now, so that you see that you may have a three letter combination as well as a two letters one&nbsp;:-)<br>
<a href="http://www.acclaimimages.com/_gallery/_SM2/0153-0512-1500-1119_SM2.jpg">http://www.acclaimimages.com/_gallery/_SM2/0153-0512-1500-1119_SM2.jpg</a><br>
How did we guess that "<font color=blue>SM2</font>" -instead of SM- would have eliminated the watermark? 
<br>We didin't guess at all&nbsp;:-) We just <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&hl=en&lr=&rls=en&q=%22acclaimimages.com%2F_gallery%2F%22&btnG=Search">searched</a>

You'll find more about "free" email in the <a href="freemail.htm">ad hoc section</a> of searchlores, the 
 most important thing is to NEVER give out real data on the web unless you are really compelled to do so (and 
 even in that case there are many ways to avoid it). 
 <br><br>
 Always choose the first option, whatever it is, 
when you (have to) "choose" some options from a menu ("Your income", "Your profession", Your "State" and so on): 
State=Afganistan, Income=less than 15 euro per year and so on... 
If you want to play, there are some funny national options like "American Samoa" "Fortune and Wallys 
 Islands" and so on.<br> The option "other" that you often find on these  menus is also great, because you will get 
 the wannabye sniffers thinking hard about updating their long palette of options, adding even more  crap to their possible choices.
 
 <br><br>
 Do not feel bad while feeding  only lies to anyone asking for your data on line: such people 
 are just scum that will use EVERYTHING you tell them for profit the very moment you do, 
 and they don't even have the decency to admit it. Screw them black and blue, such 
 clowns deserve far worse than that: never believe for a minute that their 'privacy - 
 pleads' about how they will "never use your data" could be anything else than cheap sarcasm.
 <br>
 The 
 very reason they did set up such "free" email addresses sites (and such "free" search engines and 
 "free" file repositories) is -of course- to 
 READ everything you write and to have a copy of everything you upload or create.<br> 
 Of course, klaro, no human being will ever read what you write, but their bots and grepping 
 algos will do it for the owners of the "free" email services 
 (or of the "free" search engines), presenting them 
 nice tables built on your private data as a result.
 <br>
 This brings us to a very interesting contradiction: on one site "echelon" and 
 the total big broterish control, on the other "wardriving" and pretty good anonymity... <IMG SRC="images/bulletr.gif" ALT="red" align="bottom" valign="bottom" WIDTH="13"

How comes it works?</center>
<br>
A legitimate question would be "why wikipedia works?". Anybody and his cat can write whatever he believes to be the truth. 
The arbitration committee kills only the most obnoxious kooks and wanna-be experts, and leaves many incompetent buffoons 
write whatever they want. The whole project is open 
to trolls and with little defence against them. Yet it works perfectly, and this annoys all the clowns that hate any free successfull project&nbsp;:-)<br>
There are even <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/11/business/media/11web.html">various idiots and subhumans</a> that PLANT false information in wikipedia, on purpose, in order to accuse 
it immediately afterwards of spreading false information. To no avail. Wikipedia works very 
well.
<br>
So how comes it does work?
<br>
It works BECAUSE it is an open, anarchistical, non commercial, collaborative  project: the power of the unwashed 
masses against the academical experts.
<br><br>
Wikipedia is about as accurate on science as the Encyclopaedia Britannica:

The British journal Nature ran blind tests asking experts to compare scientific entries from both publications.
<br>
The reviewers were asked to check for errors, but were not told about the source of the information.
<br>
Only eight serious errors, such as misinterpretations of 
important concepts, were detected in the pairs of articles reviewed, 
four from each encyclopaedia. 
<br>
Reviewers found 162 factual errors in the Wikipedia documents, compared to 123 in the Britannica documents.
<br>
Nature also said that its reviewers found that Wikipedia entries were often poorly 
structured and confused. 
<br><br>
Wikipedia's reliability is just a byproduct of the sheer SCALE of the project. It is not due to a peer-controlling academic 
process (with all its strenghts and weaknesses), but to the 'self-improving' nature of information that is shared on the web.
That's the reason why its reliability, already better than many academic experts would be ready to admit, is IMPROVING. That's 
why anybody that has some expertise in some specific field should contribute. That's why I will do it myself as soon as I find the time :-)
<br>
Wikipedia is indeed "a brilliant product  of open-source intellectual collaboration". Even its enemies 
now have  <i>obtorto collo</i> to admit it&nbsp;:-)

<br><br>
<i>Caveat lector</i>, of course, but this holds true for all "established" encyclopaedias as well. 

Indeed  much knowledge lies outside of academic study and "experts" . However -again- <i>caveat lector</i>: 
any seeker would soon be confused, inside or outside academia, without solid <a href="evaluate.htm">evaluation skills</a>.

Now, let's imagine that for our in-depth "private investigations" we need a given COMPLETE ARTICLE, 
not an abstract, a complete text, and we do not want to pay anyone for that. 
Let's imagine we want 
something mathematic related, I haven chosen as examples ["<font color=blue>polynomial</font>"] and ["<font color=blue>prime factorization</font>"]
<br><br>
Most searchers would use the two most "common" search engines for MATHEMATIC-RELATED articles 
 of the visible web: 
<a target=_top href="http://www.emis.de/ZMATH/">http://www.emis.de/ZMATH/</a>, which you can use to start a search and  
<a target=_top href="http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/search">http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/search</a> which you SHOULD NOT use, due to its commercial crappiness<br>
Let's search for "polynomial" <IMG SRC="https://searchlores.nickifaulk.com/bulletr.gif" ALT="red" align="bottom" valign="bottom" WIDTH="13"
HEIGHT="13">&nbsp;<br>
Let's imagine we are interested in the 
third result: "<font color=blue>The minimum period of the Ehrhart quasi-polynomial of a rational polytope</font>", alas! Now we would be 
supposed "to pay" in order to consult/see/download it. <br>But we'r seekers, right?<br>
Let's use <font color=blue>a part of the abstract</font> in order to fetch our target <i>in extenso</i>: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=opera&rls=en&q=%22+called+the+Ehrhart+quasi-polynomial+of%22&sourceid=opera&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8">" called the Ehrhart quasi-polynomial of"</a>...
see? Let's repeat this with any other article on this database... <IMG SRC="images/bulletr.gif" ALT="red" align="bottom" valign="bottom" WIDTH="13"
HEIGHT="13">&nbsp;
<br><br>
Of course we could also have used <a target=_top href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&lr=&q=%22prime+factorization%22&btnG=Search">google scholar</a>
<br><br>So, we have seen how to bypass  commercial yokes using the previously explained "long string searching" approach. <br><br>
The funny thing is that the web is so deep that we <font color=blue>do not need at all</font> to go through such bazaars.<br><br>

In fact the "open source" waves are already purifying the closed world of the scientific journals as well. Good riddance!
<br><br>
Let's search on <a target=_top href="http://www.arxiv.org/multi?group=math&%2Ffind=Search">The Front</a> (arxiv.org), that 
is slowly beating the two "established" euroamerican commercial repositories black and blue...  
for instance: <a target=_top href="http://search.arxiv.org:8081/?query=%22prime+factorization%22&in=math">"prime factorization"</a>, 
but, to keep our previous example, also: "<font color=blue>The minimum period of the Ehrhart</font>"... et voilï¿½.

<br>
On one side the Americans, who do not even let you search if you do not pay up-front (<font color=blue>US-mathscinet</font>) & on the other 
one the Europeans, who let you search, but then 
want you to pay in order to fetch your results (<font color=blue>EU-ZMATH</font>). Of course we could still 
find  our targets starting from there, but it 
is refreshing to know that there is also -amazingly coexisting on the same web- a complete 'journals' search engine, with a 
better (& rapidly growing) database and everything you need for free: <a target=_top href="http://www.arxiv.org/multi?group=math&%2Ffind=Search">the Front</a> ("<font color=blue>It freed anyone from the need 
to be in Princeton, Heidelberg or Paris in order to do frontier research</font>"). 
So -once again- the web is BOTH a bottomless cornucopia and an immense 
commercial garbage damp, and -of course- you need to know how to search <font color=blue>both</font> sides of the same mirror.

</center>

<br><br>
First of all, for your 'private investigations' a good start is the ISBN finder that all major 
search engines provide:
<br>
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?&rls=en&q=isbn+0596005458&num=100&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8">isbn 0596005458</a> at google
<br>

<br>

<br>  All on-line repositories are quite useful for finding books:<br>
<a href="http://www.uploadscout.com/UploadScout/newindex.aspx">http://www.uploadscout.com/UploadScout/newindex.aspx</a>: rapidshare & megaupload index. 
<br>You could input -for instance- <font color=blue>digital photography</font> on that search mask, but you can as well search with 
<br>
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?&rls=en&q=rapidshare+digital.photography&num=100&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8">rapidshare digital.photography</a>: google<br>
<a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=rapidshare+%22digital+photography%22&sm=Yahoo%21+Search&fr=FP-tab-web-t&toggle=1&cop=&ei=UTF-8">rapidshare "digital photography"</a>: yahoo<br>
<a href="http://search.msn.com/results.aspx?q=%7Bfrsh%3D94%7D+%7Bmtch%3D69%7D+%7Bpopl%3D33%7D+rapidshare+%22digitalphotography%22&FORM=QBHP">{frsh=94} {mtch=69} {popl=33} rapidshare "digitalphotography"</a>: msnsearch<br> or whatever local/main search engine you may like...
<br><br>Well, I'm using "<font color=blue>digital photography</font>", or "<font color=blue>photoshop</font>" 
query examples just to demonstrate that 
finding "photoshop-related" books is almost as easy as writing them (everyone and his dog is writing a photoshop book 
nowadays).<br> Yet 
maybe many of the friends in this room would prefer, instead of "<font color=blue>digital photography</font>", 
this <a href="http://search.msn.com/results.aspx?q=%7Bfrsh%3D94%7D+%7Bpopl%3D20%7D+%7Bmtch%3D99%7D+rapidshare.de%2Ffiles+hacking&FORM=QBRE">kind of books</a>?
<br><br>

Note, however, that the rapidshare search-examples above are JUST ONE EXAMPLE:<br>
Rapidshare is one <font color=blue>of many</font> "upload repositories" where people can (and do with gusto) upload large files.
<br> 
It's quick, it allows unlimited downloads, and it has some free-happy-hours in the morning. 
So you don't need, of course, to pay. But there are <a href="local.htm#reposi">many</a> similar repositories:<br>
<a target=_top href="http://www.rapidshare.de/">rapidshare.de/</a>: 30 Mb max, forever but after 30 days unused the file is removed,  daily download limit of 3,000 MB for hosted files<br>
<a target=_top href="http://www.yousendit.com">YouSendIt</a>: 1 Giga max, after 7 days or 25 downloads (whichever occurs first) 
the file is automatically removed<br>
<a target=_top href="http://www.mytempdir.com/">mytempdir</a>: 25 Mb max, 14 days * 1200 free downloads, after that only from 23.00 to 7.00.<br>
<a target=_top href="http://www.sendmefile.com">Sendmefile</a>: 30 Mb max, after 14 days the file is automatically removed<br>
<a target=_top href="http://www.megaupload.com">Megaupload</a>: 500 Mb max <font color=blue>(!)</font>, forever but after 30 days unused the file is removed (like rapidshare)<br>
<a target=_top href="http://www.ultrashare.net/">ultrashare.net/</a>: 30 Mb max, forever but after 30 days unused the file is removed (like rapidshare)<br>

<a target=_top href="http://www.spread-it.com/">http://www.spread-it.com/</a>: 500Mb - Forever or after 14 days if unused<br> 
<a target=_top href="http://turboupload.com/">http://turboupload.com/</a>: 70Mb - download delay in order to show pub<br> 
<a target=_top href="http://www.4shared.com/">http://www.4shared.com/</a>: 100Mb - 10Mb per file Forever or after 30 days if unused<br>
<br>
and so on, a fairly complete list of many <font color=blue>Files and images repositories</font> is <a href="local.htm#reposi">here</a>.
<br><br>Anyhow, 
there's a whole section regarding <a href="books.htm">books searches</a> (and a fairly complete 
<a href="library.htm">library</a> as well) at <a href="http://www.searchlores.org"">searchlores</a>, and, if interested in finding 
any book whatsoever, you'll be able
to find more pointers there. 
<br>
Suffice to say that <font color=blue>most</font> books mankind has written are already on the web somewhere, 
and that while we are sitting here, hic et nunc, hundreds of fully scanned <font color=blue>libraries</font> are going on line... if you
are attentive enough, 
and if your searching scripts are good, you can 
even hear the clincking "thud" of those huge databases going on line...  
<IMG SRC="images/bulletr.gif" ALT="red" align="bottom" valign="bottom" WIDTH="13"
HEIGHT="13">&nbsp;<br><br>In order to fetch books you just need some correct strings.<br>
<br>



A simple trick is to use <a href="http://a9.com/-/search/advSearch">the powerful A9 engine</a>, 
for instance, for conan doyle,
 <a href="http://a9.com/conan%20doyle?a=obooks">http://a9.com/conan%20doyle?a=obooks</a> 
 and then fetch <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0553328255/ref=sib_rdr_next3_ex17/102-1260521-5632156?%5Fencoding=UTF8&p=S00P&ns=1#reader-page">the 
 study 
 in scarlet</a>.
 <br>
 Of course once we have <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22He+is+sure+to+be+at+the+laboratory%22+%22returned+my+companion.%22&num=100&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8">some arrows</a>, it is 
 relatively easy to fetch whole copies of a book all over the web...
<br><br>
A simple trick is to use google's books' search facility. Let's search for '<font color=blue>The Hound of the Baskervilles</font>':
<a href="http://books.google.com/books?q=doyle&btnG=Search+Books&hl=en">http://books.google.com/books?q=doyle&btnG=Search+Books&hl=en</a>:
now let's chose a phrase from page three (more pages we cannot see  because of the "patents' dictatorship"): <font color=blue>"The probability lies in that direction"</font>:
It's more than enough: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=opera&rls=en&q=%22The+probability+lies+in+that+direction%22&sourceid=opera&num=100&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8">"The probability lies in that direction"</a>. q.e.d.
<br><br>

Of course this is also true for all kind of patented books... let's see:
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22I+have+no+fitting+gifts+to+give+you+at+our+parting,%22&hl=en&lr=&filter=0">"I have no fitting gifts to give you at our parting,"</a>...
<br>
and we land here, for instance: <a href="http://bbs5.xilubbs.com/cgi-bin/bbs/view?forum=wlqbq&message=564"> 'I  have no fitting  gifts  to  give you at our parting,' said Faramir;
`but take these staves...</a> (J.R.R. Tolkien: Two Towers)
<br><br>
The more "popular" a target, the easier it is to find it:
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&hl=en&lr=&rls=en&q=%22some+students+were+standing+up+to+get+a+better+look+at+Harry+as+he+sat%2C+frozen%2C+in+his+seat%22&btnG=Search">"some students were standing up to get a better look at Harry as he sat, frozen, in his seat"</a>

Uhmmm. Is this a 'mature' and enough politically uncorrect audience? Anyway we are speaking of '<font color=blue>private</font>' investigations, 
aren't we?<br>
<br>Here is a better search than 
the (still working) <a href="http://www.google.com/search?&rls=en&q=playmates+index.of&num=100&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8">playmates index.of</a> that we have seen 
at the beginning:

<br><a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&hs=k&hl=en&lr=&rls=en&q=1981-02.jpg+playmates&btnG=Search">1981-02.jpg playmates</a><br>
Of course you could try a different approach: 
Finally, a very nice trick to avoid those "index of" spammers & clowns<br>
                  <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&rls=en&q=intitle%3A%22index+of%2F%22+%22Apr-2004%22++%22jpg%22+playboy+&btnG=Search">intitle:"index of/" "Apr-2004"  "jpg" playboy</a>
                       
                        note 
the "<font color=blue>Apr-2004</font>" snippet, that you can change at leisure&nbsp;:-)
<br>
<br>It's often useful to (try to) find images with some ad hoc target name guessing. 
In this case, since we have one playmate every month, chances are that there are <font color=blue>date-related</font> images' URLs.<br>
Note that you could just try <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&hs=3&hl=en&lr=&rls=en&q=1983-03.jpg&btnG=Search">1983-03.jpg</a>, 
without the specifying suffix 'playmates', or youy could change that suffix to 'playboy', or you could 
repeat the search with 
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&hl=en&lr=&rls=en&q=1983_03.jpg&btnG=Search">1983_03.jpg</a> (note the underscore 
instead of the hyphen) and so on,  or even try 
 something like  
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&hl=en&lr=&rls=en&q=playmate6.jpg&btnG=Search">playmate6.jpg</a>, in the (correct) 
assumption, that where there are at least <font color=blue>6</font> jpgs, you'll have more.
        <br><br>
       
Of course such searches do not need to be so frivolous or 'Pr0n' oriented: 
<a href="http://images.google.com/images?svnum=100&hl=en&lr=&safe=off&rls=en&q=monet8.jpg&btnG=Search">monet8.jpg</a>, 
and you'll land in Monet-heavy and images-rich sites.

<br><br>

size=+3>Music searching</font></center></td><td><center><a href="private.htm#toptop">Top</a></center></td></tr></table>
</center>
<br>
A completely new wave of music searching has opened up through the relatively recent 
<a href="musicblogs.htm">mp3 blogs</a> phenomenon, but usually it is MUCH  simpler to just fetch the music you 
need from the web any time you need it.
<br><br>
See the <a href="private.htm#combingwebbit">Combing webbit</a> above.
<br><br><font size=+1>
<font color=blue>Your phantasy is the limit!</font></font><br>Simply adding for 
instance "<font color=blue>4.6M</font>" (or whatever similar you may fancy) to your querystring 
will ensure that there are enough big and juicy MP3 
in your targets: <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=imagine+lennon++mp3+OR+ma4+OR+ogg+intitle%3A%22Index+of%22+-metallica+%2B%224.6M%22&prssweb=Search&ei=UTF-8&n=10&fl=0&x=wrt">imagine lennon  mp3 OR ma4 OR ogg intitle:"Index of" -metallica +"4.6M"</a>
<br><br>
Most simple trick:<br>
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?&rls=en&q=%22index+of%22+imagine+m4a%7Cwma&num=100&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8">"index of" imagine m4a|wma</a>

<br>
<br>Another one (for music videos):<br>
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&c2coff=1&q=%3Fintitle%3Aindex.of%3F+%22crazy+frog%22+wmv+%22axel+f%22&btnG=Search">?intitle:index.of? "crazy frog" wmv "axel f"</a> <br>
or
<br>
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%3Fintitle%3Aindex.of%3F+%22madonna%22+wmv&btnG=Search&hl=en&lr=&c2coff=1">?intitle:index.of? "madonna" wmv</a>
<br>
<br>Another one  (for mp3 & co):<br>
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?&rls=en&q=intitle:index.of+%2B+mp3+%2B+%22garfunkel%22+-html+-htm+-php+-asp+-txt+-pls&num=100&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8">intitle:index.of + mp3 + "garfunkel" -html -htm -php -asp -txt -pls</a>
<br>
<br>
Another one:
<br>
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?&rls=en&q=intitle:index.of+%2B+%22mp3%22+%2B+%22garfunkel%22+-htm+-html+-php+-asp&num=100&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8">intitle:index.of + "mp3" + "band name" -htm -html -php -asp</a>
<br>
Or even this, found with the previous query, so big that it may crash our browsers...
<br>
<a href="http://24.91.184.80/jserver/files/music/">http://24.91.184.80/jserver/files/music/</a>
<br><br>
or
<a href="http://mensa.familia.rebello.nom.br/media/Som/MPG_RA_VQF/Mp3/">http://mensa.familia.rebello.nom.br/media/Som/MPG_RA_VQF/Mp3/</a>, 
<br>
found through<br>
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=opera&rls=en&q=imagine+lennon+mp3+OR+ma4+OR+ogg+intitle:%22Index+of%22+-metallica&sourceid=opera&num=100&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8">imagine lennon  mp3 OR ma4 OR ogg intitle:"Index of" -metallica</a>
<br><br>
Some of the webbits we use for images work for music as well:
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&hs=Cku&hl=en&lr=&rls=en&q=intitle%3A%22index+of%2F%22+%22Apr-2004%22+%22jpg%22+garfunkel&btnG=Search">intitle:"index of/" "Apr-2004" "jpg" garfunkel</a>
<br><br>However, all these tecniques are overkill. In fact the amazing thing is that 
even the most stupid searches, those that should NOT work, will give results:<br>
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hs=mtk&hl=en&lr=&rls=en&q=madonna+index.of+mp3&btnG=Search">madonna index.of mp3</a>... q.e.d: 
wherever, whenever, whatever.

 How to subdivide a query in manageable chunks (by Various Authors)</font><br><br>
 <br><center><font size=+1><font color=blue>
 Do any search engines 
or techniques exist to get more than -say- 1000 results from a search engine?</font></font></center>
<br><br>
Usually you just <font color=blue>refine</font> your search.
<br>
<br>You can narrow your query in various ways: 
<br>eliminating crap (the infamous -tits example)
<br>
<br>adding broader -but relevant- terms ("<a target=_top href="http://www.google.com/search?num=30&meta=hl%3D%26lr%3D&q=%22digital+photography%22">digital photography</a>": 20.400.000,  +"<a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=30&hl=en&lr=&ie=ISO-8859-1&q=%22digital+photography%22+%2B%22shutter+priority%22&btnG=Search">shutter priority"</a>= 190.000 +<a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=30&hl=en&lr=&ie=ISO-8859-1&q=%22digital+photography%22+%2B%22shutter+priority%22+%2B%22tiff%22&btnG=Search">tiff"</a>=40.500)
<br>
<br>and with the results it is still good to jump first 
to -say page five or ten, and then go backwards when evaluating the results :-)
<br><hr width=36% align=left>
If you have time, you can try things like these on Google 
(the strategy for other search engines is <i>mutatis mutandis</i> 
the same):</p><ul><li><a target=_top href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=blabla+site%3Acom+inurl%3Awww">blabla site:com inurl:www</a>
<li><a target=_top href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&hl=en&lr=&safe=off&q=blabla+site%3Acom+-inurl%3Awww">blabla site:com -inurl:www</a>
<li><a target=_top href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&hl=en&lr=&safe=off&q=blabla+-site%3Acom+inurl%3Awww">blabla -site:com inurl:www</a>
<li><a target=_top href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&hl=en&lr=&safe=off&q=blabla+-site%3Acom+-inurl%3Awww">blabla -site:com -inurl:www</a>
</ul><p align=justify>With this kind of strategy 
you can divide your SERPs in more or less four equal parts. If you use another common keyword or feature, 
you can double the number of equal sets, for each new keyword...
<br>
<hr width=36% align=left>
There is a more direct way to achieve what you are asking,with the <font color=blue>antipagination extension</font> in firefox.
<br>https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?id=853
<br>It flattens result pages (even works in forum pages)
<br>
<br>There is a userjs that works in opera too and does the same only for google's result pages here:
<br>http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/1392
<br><hr width=36% align=left>
Another trick:
<br>
<br><a target=_top href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&hs=DQL&hl=en&lr=&rls=en&q=blabla+-inurl%3Ahtm&btnG=Search">blabla  -inurl:htm</a> 1.680.000
<br>
<br><a target=_top href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&hs=Y5f&hl=en&lr=&rls=en&q=blabla+-inurl%3Ahtml&btnG=Search">blabla -inurl:html</a> 2.050.000
<br>
<br>the differences are noticeable after the first pumped results
<br>
<br>of course you can add and play with -/+ php or -/+ pdf or regional parameters (-/+fr -/+nl etcetera)
<br>

     <font size=+2>   
 3) Another google approach (by Mordred)<br></font>
Here is a
way to gather relevant info about your target

<br><a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=25&hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=utf-8&q=%22index%2Bof%2F%22+%22rain.wav%2A%2A%2A%2A%2A%2A%22&btnG=Google+Search">"index+of/" "rain.wav******"</a>
<br>Useful to see date <font color=blue>and size</font> that follow your target name...

        <br><br>
 
      <font size=+2>   
4)Googe's advance operators: "aeroplane finder" and other crap<br></font>
Here is a
google's easy implementation:

<br><a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&hl=en&lr=&rls=en&q=from+berlin+to+helsinki&btnG=Search">from berlin to helsinki</a>
<br>Clicking on the first link) 
you have an automatic price comparison.
<br><br>
On a similar path, there is the useful <font color=blue>define:</font> operator we have already seen, and all 
the other <a href="google.htm#adaope">advanced operators</a> (<font color=blue>stocks</font> and other crap).
<br><br>
A possibly useful one is the 'change' operator: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?&rls=en&q=234+USD+in+euro&num=100&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8">234 USD in euro</a>, 
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?&rls=en&q=234+euro+in+CHF&num=100&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8">234 euro in CHF</a>, 
 <a href="http://www.google.com/search?&rls=en&q=234+french+money+in+GBP&num=100&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8">234 french money in GBP</a>,
 <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&hs=1fq&hl=en&lr=&client=opera&rls=en&q=+currency+of+germany+in+malaysian+money&btnG=Search">currency 
 of germany in malaysian money</a>
  and so on.
  
        <br><br>
      Another useful possibility are the mathematical operators: 
      <br><a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&q=twenty+miles+in+kilometers&btnG=Search">twenty miles in kilometers</a>
      <br>
      <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=45+Fahrenheit+in+celsius&spell=1">45 Fahrenheit in celsius</a>
      <br><a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&q=%28%28894151%2A66771%29%2B456%29%2F1241&btnG=Search">((894151*66771)+456)/1241</a>: 48 109 070.8<br>
      But here you should not use google, for mathematical calculations 
       yahoo is better: <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=%28%28894151%2A66771%29%2B456%29%2F1241&sm=Yahoo%21+Search&fr=FP-tab-web-t&toggle=1&cop=&ei=UTF-8">((894151*66771)+456)/1241</a>=48,109,070.8114423826.

A 
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=25&hl=en&q=synecdoche+term+rhetoric&btnG=Google+Search&sourceid=fravia" target="_blank">Synecdoche</a> ("sin-EK-doh-kee") is the rhetorical or metaphorical
substitution of a part for the whole, or vice versa. This approach is widely used in searching, 
because it allows you to get at your signal 'from the bottom', eliminating part 
of the noise.<br><br>
For some specific examples see <a href="synecdoc.htm">synecdoc.htm</a>. 
<br>
Here let's just have "a visual look" at a search:
<br><br>
The red cylinder below represents the TOTALITY of accessible web sites that 
could be of interest to you -in the context of your current search. The small 
rings shows four different specific <SPAN STYLE="color: black; background: yellow">clusters</span> of interesting sites. 
<br>Please remember that <u>inside</u> the cylinder the 'void' is only APPARENT! 
That's the part 
of the internet you cannot reach through the main search engines. There are interesting sites 
there as well (as a matter of fact MANY more than on the 'accessible' outside), but to grab them you'll have to use 
more advanced techniques than commercial engines&nbsp;:-)

<b>1</b>&nbsp;You land first time to an interesting cluster of sites trough your 'clean cut'<br>
<b>2</b>&nbsp;You have 'synecdochically' moved horizontally, modifying your original clean-cut<br>
<b>3</b>&nbsp;These sites will be relatively easy to find, they are both on an horizontal and on a 
vertical synecdoche. Note that the signal width of the vertical synecdoches 
(e.g. the yellow one on the right side of the image) may vary quite a lot, 
while horizontal synecdoches' width seems more costant.<br>
<b>4</b>&nbsp;You'll never find this cluster 
with your current synecdochical approaches, you'll have to 
devise a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT cut.

                One of the main reasons why the main search engines  together cover (at best) just something less than 1/2 of the web 
                 is a LINGUISTIC one.  The main search engines are, in fact, "Englishcentric" if I may use this term, and 
                 in many cases - which is even worse -  are subject to a heavy "Americancentric bias".  
                 <br><br>
                 The web is truly international, to an extent that even those who did 
                 both physically travel and virtually browse a lot tend to underestimate. <br>
                 Some of the pages you'll find may point to problems, ideals and aims so 'alien' from your point 
                 of view that -even if you knew their languages or if they happen to be in English- you 
                 cannot even hope to understand them. 
                 <br>
                 On the other hand this multicultural 
                 and truly international cooperation may bring some  fresh air in a 
                 world of cloned Euro-American zombies who drink the same coke with the same bottles, wear the same shirts, 
                 the same shoes (and the same pants), 
                 and sit ritually in the same McDonalds in order to perform their compulsory  
                 and quick "reverse shitting".
         <br><br> 
         But seekers need to understand this Babel if they want to add depth to their queries.<br>
           

   There are MANY linguistic aids out there on the web, and many systems that allow you to translate a page, or a snippet of text from 
   say, Spanish, into English or viceversa. But much rarer, and much more useful for us, are sites 
that allow us to understand -eve roughly- pages written in Japanese, Chinese, Hindi, Russian, Korean, you name the funny alphabet&nbsp;:-)
   <br><br>
  As an example of how powerful such services can be in order to understand, for example, a Japanese site, 
  have a look at the following trick:
  <br><br>
 <font color=blue size=+2>RIKAI</font><br>
An incredible translator!<br> 
<a target=_top href="http://www.rikai.com/perl/Home.pl">http://www.rikai.com/perl/Home.pl</a>
<br>Try it for instance onto http://www.shirofan.com/ See? It   "massages" WWW pages and
 places "popup translations" from the EDICT database behind the Japanese text!
<br><br>

for instance<br>
http://www.rikai.com/perl/LangMediator.En.pl?mediate_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.shirofan.com%2F

<br>See?<br>
   You can use this tool to "guess" the meaning of many a Japanese page or -and especially- Japanese search engine options, 
   even if you do not know Japanese&nbsp;:-)<br>
   You can easily understand how, in this way, you can -with the proper tools- explore the wealth of results that the 
   Japanese, Chinese, Korean, you name them, search engines may (and probably will) give you.

<br><font size=+2>Ode to the seekers</font><br></center>
<br><font size=+1>

Like a skilled native, the able seeker has become <font color=blue>part of the web</font>. He knows the smell of 
his forest: the foul-smelling  mud of the popups, the slime of 
a rotting commercial javascript. He knows the sounds of the web: the gentle rustling of the <font color=blue>jpg</font>s,  
the cries of the brightly colored 
<font color=blue>mp3</font>s that chase one another among the trees, singing as they go; 
the dark snuffling of the <font color=blue>m4a</font>s, the mechanical, monotone clincking
 of the huge, blind databases, the pathetic cry of the common user: 
a plaintive cooing that slides from one useless page down to the next until 
it dies away in a sad, little moan. In fact, to all 
those who do not understand it,
today's Internet looks more and more 
like a closed, hostile and terribly boring commercial world.<br>Yet if you 
stop and 
hear attentively, you may be able to hear the seekers, deep into the shadows,  
singing
a lusty chorus of praise to this wonderful world of theirs -- a world that gives them everything they want.<br>
<font color=blue>The web is the habitat of the seeker, and in return for his knowledge and skill 
it satisfies all his needs.</font><br>
<br>The seeker 
does not even need any more to hoard on his hard 
disks whatever he has found: all the various images, 
musics, films, books and whatsnot that he  fetches from the web... 
he can just <font color = blue>taste  and leave  there</font> what he finds, without even copying it, because he knows that nothing 
can disappear any more: 
once anything lands on the web, it will always be 
there, available for the eternity to all those that possess its secret <a href="nomomen.htm">name</a>... <br><br>
<font size=+2>
 <font color=blue>The web-quicksand moves all the time, yet nothing can sink</font>.</font>
 <br><br>
In order to fetch all kinds of delicious fruits,  the seeker just needs to raise his sharp searchstrings.<br><br>
In perfect 
armony with the sourronding internet forest, he can fetch again and again, at will, any  target he fancies, 
 wherever it may have been "hidden". The seeker
  moves unseen among sites and backbones,
using his anonymity skills, his powerful proxomitron shield and his mighty HOST file. <br>
If need be, he can quickly hide among the zombies, mimicking their behaviour and thus disappearing into the mass.



<br><br>
Moving silently along the cornucopial forest of his web, picking his fruits and digging his juwels, 
the seeker avoids easily the many vicious traps that have been set to catch
 all the furry, sad little animals that happily use MSIE (and outlook),  that use only 
 one-word google "searches",
 and that 
browse and chat around all the time without proxies, bouncing against trackers and web-bugs 
and smearing all their personal data around. 
<br><br>
Moreover the seeker is armed: 
his sharp browser will quickly cut to pieces any slimy javascript 
 or rotting advertisement  that the 
commercial beasts may have put on his way. His  bots' jaws will tear apart any database defense, his powerful 
scripts will send 
 perfectly balanced searchstrings  far into the forest.

<br><font size=+2>Your own private investigations</font><br></center>
<br><font size=+1>

The power of searching at your fingertips, what are you waiting for? <br>
Start your own private investigations! Here two rather naï¿½ve examples.<br><br>
<font color=blue>1) Inflation</font><br>
Don't you have the impression that the real inflation 
we have all to endure (with more and more expensive everyday prices) is <u>waaay more</u> than that 
ludicrous 2,1% (circa) that our powers that be claim year after year?<br>
Well, there are a series of newspapers with their <a href="newsfeeds.htm#archi">COMPLETE ARCHIVES</a>  on the web, searchable, for free.
<br>Supermarket chains, 
Aldi, Carrefour, you name it, have also published on the web their "fabolous" offers and prices. 
<br>Or try this: 
<a href="http://www.google.com/catalogs">http://www.google.com/catalogs</a>&nbsp;:-)
<br>
You'll be able to find the older pages, as we have seen, using <a href="private.htm#disapp">webarchive</a> or similar web-snapshots repositories.
<br><br>
<font color=blue>Assignement</font>: Find the real inflation using all available data.<br><br>
Some simple suggestions:<br>
Use an 
average of price components that is weighted and categorized in 
approximately the same manner as the official Consumer Price Index.<br> 
Housing should represent the largest component at 40% with other categories having lesser impact.
<br> 
The inflation rate should be calculated as a price multiplier with a base year of 1995,
 to represent the number of "1st January 2006"  
euro that are required to purchase what the equivalent of one "1st January 2006"  EUR  bought in 1995.<br> 
The annualized inflation rate is the 
equivalent average compounded yearly inflation rate over the 10 year period.  <br>
Take account of education and medical care costs, also easy to find and check on the web (some <a href="combing.htm">combing</a> 
and <a href="stalking.htm">social engineering</a>  will go 
a long way in order to find them).
<br>
Create two subgroups: 1995-1999, 2000-2005
<br>
If you do it, you will soon realize that -while the euro itself has nothing to do with it- 
the high inflation trend (around 6~8% real, <u>not</u> 2,1%) has been a (quite interesting) constant.
<br><br>
Purchasing power and living standards been steadily reduced, in Europe and elsewhere,
 through a higher than admitted real inflation, which 
translates of course into an automatic salary decrease for the great majority, bar speculators.
<br>This has been coupled 
with a prolonged (by law) "active life" (read shorter pension), and longer working hours (and working days) without 
any salary compensation whatsoever for the unwashed masses.

<font color=blue>2) Punishing greedy and corrupt ones</font><br>
<br>
D'you have in your town a station being built, a new industrial area being planned, any building permits being granted, 
any committee for the management of public housing? 
<br><br>
You can bet that -in 99% of cases- someone is using law-loopholes and/or a net of political protection in order 
to make money illegally.<br>
But you  now have  the <font color=blue>power of the seeker</font>! Don't underestimate it.<br>
You can explore all <a href="newsfeeds.htm">newspapers</a>' databases, you can easily find 
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?&rls=en&q=%22public+housing%22+mismanagement&num=100&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8">related 
news</a>, you can seek in <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=fr&ned=fr&q=fraude+gestion&ie=UTF-8&sa=N&tab=nw">many 
languages</a>...
<br><br>In a more and more Internet-oriented society a seeker can find out quite a lot about 
his targets.<br>
You can stalk people, lure and/or troll info out of them or about them, find out where they live, 
how much they earn, when, where and 
how they started to work (political appointment? Public competition? Father's connections?) <br>
You can, with simple social engineering tricks, get in touch with their co-workers, enter their databases, 
have a look at the <font color=blue>code of their doc format documents</font>, where word, often enough and per default, keeps all the 
corrections and changes which have been made to a document...



<br><br>
Your 'private investigations' may be small crumbs, but even small crumbs may grind the 
well-greased wheels of your own local political/commercial vermine!
