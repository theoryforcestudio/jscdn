when i say huge, it IS huge. See this DTED 
(Digital Terrain Elevation Data) file : /ftpdir/dted0/ddworldbsq.bsq <br>

geeesh, i don't really understand what i'm fishing.  <br>
is this really public ?        <br>
Maybe this specs would help :  <br>

Geospatial Standards and Specifications 
    <hr>
What is DTED? Some explanations:
<br>
http://slashdot.org/articles/99/01/06/1630245.shtml 
<br>
and 
  <br>
http://openmap.bbn.com/ 

<br>What is DTED? 
 <br>
Digital Terrain Elevation Data (DTED) is an elevation database distributed by NIMA 
(http://www.nima.mil). 
The OpenMap DTEDLayer(http://openmap.bbn.com/ doc/api/com/bbn/openmap/layer/dted/DTEDLayer.html) can create terrain renderings for DTED levels 0 (elevations are 1 km apart), 1 (100 meters apart), and 2 (10 meters apart). 

<br>Can OpenMap display DCW, VMAP, VPF?  <br>
Yes, we have an OpenMap layer that can display this data. The VPFLayer javadoc (http://openmap.bbn.com/doc/api/ com/bbn/openmap/layer/vpf/VPFLayer.html) includes a description of the various openmap.properties you need to set to select data for display. 
<br>

oh.. i almost forgot. i've fished a (again huge) map 
gem. this time i'm sure, it is free and -open- stuff :  <br>

<br>~
<br>
<br>i've noticed a strange behaviour of altavista (sounds familiar). 
<br>http://muz.ca/books/literature/zipz/
<br>
<br>this url will be our example. and more specialy this special zip file located there :
<br>
<br><b>-&gt; <a href="http://muz.ca/books/literature/zipz/ReneDescartes-DiscourseOnTheMethodOfRightlyConductingTheReason,AndSeekingTheTruthInScience.zip">ReneDescartes-DiscourseOnTheMethodOfRightlyConductingTheReason,AndSeekingTheTruthInScience.zip</a> &lt;-</b>
<br>
<br>altavista check for you the uppercase if you keep all your queries in lower (but not the inverse); and he doesn't take in account the '-'
<br>we can then search for ReneDescartes or DiscourseOnTheMethodOfRightlyConductingTheReason,AndSeekingTheTruthInScience  (and 'zip', of course)
<br>
<br>'<a href="http://www.altavista.com/sites/search/res_text?sc=on&hl=on&avkw=tgz&q=descartes+AND+%28title%3A%22index+of%22+AND+%22parent+directory%22++AND+%28title%3A%22books%22+OR+title%3A%22book%22+OR+title%3A%22ebook%22+OR+title%3A%22ebooks%22%29+AND+%28zip+OR+pdf+OR+tiff+OR+txt%29+AND+NOT+%28htm+OR+html%29%29">descartes</a>' : muz.ca not in the results <b>NOP</b>
<br>no way to put an asterisk BEFORE the word.. that causes some trouble for ebooks searching (in particular) because frequently the name appear at the END of the filename (ex: lewiscaroll)
<br>
<br>'<a href="http://www.altavista.com/sites/search/res_text?sc=on&hl=on&avkw=tgz&q=rene*++AND+%28title%3A%22index+of%22+AND+%22parent+directory%22++AND+%28title%3A%22books%22+OR+title%3A%22book%22+OR+title%3A%22ebook%22+OR+title%3A%22ebooks%22%29+AND+%28zip+OR+pdf+OR+tiff+OR+txt%29+AND+NOT+%28htm+OR+html%29%29">rene*</a>' : muz.ca not in the results <b>NOP</b>
<br>logic <a target=_top href="http://help.altavista.com/adv_search/syntax">:</a>
<br>
<br><i>The asterisk is a wildcard; any letters can take the place of the asterisk. Bass* would find documents with bass, basset and bassinet. 
<br>You must type at least three letters before the *.
<br>You can also place the * in the middle of a word. This is useful when you're unsure about spelling.
<br>Colo*r would find documents that contain color and colour.</i>
<br>
<br>i've read in a translated version of this doc that the asterisk standed for 5 chars.
<br>renedescartes -&gt; 13 chars. So we miss 9 chars with 'rene'
<br>
<br>'<a href="http://www.altavista.com/sites/search/res_text?sc=on&hl=on&avkw=tgz&q=rened*++AND+%28title%3A%22index+of%22+AND+%22parent+directory%22++AND+%28title%3A%22books%22+OR+title%3A%22book%22+OR+title%3A%22ebook%22+OR+title%3A%22ebooks%22%29+AND+%28zip+OR+pdf+OR+tiff+OR+txt%29+AND+NOT+%28htm+OR+html%29%29&kl=XX">rened*</a>' : muz.ca is the result <b>YEP</b>
<br>right. but it still makes 8 chars to have the full keyword. 
<br>why ? Maybe the translated version of the doc was wrong. maybe it's more than 5 char. but less than 9 chars.
<br>
<br>
<br>Now, let's use the second part of the filename :
<br>
<br>'<a href="http://www.altavista.com/sites/search/res_text?sc=on&hl=on&avkw=tgz&q=DiscourseOnThe*+AND+%28title%3A%22index+of%22+AND+%22parent+directory%22++AND+%28title%3A%22books%22+OR+title%3A%22book%22+OR+title%3A%22ebook%22+OR+title%3A%22ebooks%22%29+AND+%28zip+OR+pdf+OR+tiff+OR+txt%29+AND+NOT+%28htm+OR+html%29%29&kl=XX">discourseonthe*</a>' : muz.ca not in the results <b>NOP</b>
<br>hehe :) we miss 62 chars on this one.
<br>
<br>but
<br>
<br>'<a href="http://www.altavista.com/sites/search/res_text?sc=on&hl=on&avkw=tgz&q=discourseonthe**+AND+%28title%3A%22index+of%22+AND+%22parent+directory%22++AND+%28title%3A%22books%22+OR+title%3A%22book%22+OR+title%3A%22ebook%22+OR+title%3A%22ebooks%22%29+AND+%28zip+OR+pdf+OR+tiff+OR+txt%29+AND+NOT+%28htm+OR+html%29%29">discourseonthe**</a>' : muz.ca is the result <a>YEP&lt;/b&gt;
<br>wtf ? a hidden feature ? (i'm sure i've read this somewhere in searchlores, but where ?)
<br>
<br>and then why, o why, this query doesn't work :
<br>
<br>'<a href="http://www.altavista.com/sites/search/res_text?sc=on&hl=on&avkw=tgz&q=rene**+AND+%28title%3A%22index+of%22+AND+%22parent+directory%22++AND+%28title%3A%22books%22+OR+title%3A%22book%22+OR+title%3A%22ebook%22+OR+title%3A%22ebooks%22%29+AND+%28zip+OR+pdf+OR+tiff+OR+txt%29+AND+NOT+%28htm+OR+html%29%29">rene**</a>' : muz.ca not in the results <b>NOP</b> &#33;&#33;

 it takes a little bit more work... but ya can get in

<br>http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF8&oe=UTF8&safe=off&q=site%3Awww.twinkle.ws+Big+U.txt&btnG=Google+Search
<br>search the files that are in the index folder .. ie Big.U.txt
<br>
<br>or taking a look inside one of the indexs : http://216.239.51.100/search?q=cache:wTLh71OtCQwC:www.twinkle.ws/reading/unsorted/mirror5/Neal.STEPHENSON/+site:www.twinkle.ws+Big+U.txt&hl=en&ie=UTF8
<br>
<br>we see in viewing inside ..'The.Great.Simoleon.Caper.txt'
<br>
<br>so we do a sites search of twinkle for the great caper
<br>and then use the cache link as u all have noted works :)
<br>http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF8&oe=UTF8&safe=off&q=site%3Awww.twinkle.ws+The.Great.Simoleon.Caper.txt&btnG=Google+Search

<br>


          http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.twinkle.ws%2Freading%2Funsorted%2Fmirror4%2F&btnG=Google+Search
<br>
<br>I am terrible at explaining things so if you'll forgive me and give me another go I'd like to explain better (if possible--hic hic)
<br>
<br>If you find an index such as the above example-- we can see that google cache HAS indexed and cached it... however clciking on the links may very well take you to a redirected or dead hyperlinked ozone
<br>
<br>the fact that it has cached this index (though not tested) just may mean that these links are also CACHED -- however --- because they are hyperlinks when u click on them they perform in a different manner than we may want --- goin to redirects etc..........
<br>
<br>so what we can do is this:
<br>
<br>we know the site
<br>we know the directory listings
<br>(IF there are mirrors or a new URL site --- and this one is simply closed down etc... typing in 3-4 of the directory NAMES may find them listed elsewhere under a new domain)
<br>we know google has cached THIS Index
<br>
<br>we can therefore ask google to do a SITE search for any directory name that we see listed: one we see is tolkien
<br>
<br>example:
<br>site:www.twinkle.ws tolkien
<br>
<br>once we peek inside this directory we can grab file names we may be interested in ... then we can either hit back button and ADD this filename to our site:domainesearch directoryname filename
<br>then check cache of
<br>
<br>or if we see a link that we want to goto that is being driven elsewhere we can just copy the address instead of backclicking into google and adding the filename
<br>
<br>site:www.twinkle.ws tolkien KING ARTHUR
<br>
<br>this narrows the search down and because google has cached---it is there
<br>*************************************************
<br>another example address:
<br>http://216.239.39.100/search?q=cache:ilU-GXOYERYC:www.twinkle.ws/reading/unsorted/mirror4/+&hl=en
<br>
<br>just take everything off the browser url after cache 
<br>http://216.239.39.100/search?q=cache:
<br>and copy and paste the link u are looking at in google:too
<br>http://216.239.39.100/search?q=cache:<b>http://www.twinkle.ws/reading/unsorted/mirror5/J.R.R.TOLKIEN/Gawain.(King.Arthur.Original).txt</B>
<br>
<br>so anyway the short story of the long winded story is--- if google is finding you an idex or page showing its been cached--chances are the hyperlinks u are clicking on that are taking you elsewhere just need a little more fineese to get them to goto the proper places :)
