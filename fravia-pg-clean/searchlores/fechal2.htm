First attempt to answer to challenge [1 : SARAH] of the seachal2.htm
-------------------------------------------------------------

My targeted country for this challenge is France. I'm not 
an experienced seeker, and in term of evaluation the fact 
that the language used is my mother's one has done 50% of 
the job for me :)

I used the lexicon from <a href="http://www.ipr-helpdesk.org/t_en/i_007_en.asp?language=&l=">ipr-helpdesk</a>
in order to translate the "intellectual property" related terms the 
better i could.
First of all i have build a "pool" of sites that seemed related 
to our subject.

I used for that the meta search engine <a href="https://searchlores.nickifaulk.com/www.surfwax.com">surfwax</a>, 
the directory of search engines <a href="http://www.indicateur.com">L'indicateur</a>, the SE 
<a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> for his new hability to search inside 
PDF, and the <a href="http://www.lii.org/">librarian's index to the internet</a>
All sites were collected in 2 hours (if i remember it right)
You can consult my draft on the attached file : <a href="https://searchlores.nickifaulk.com/lokipool.txt">lokipool.txt</a>

The first step of our travel is law-perusing. In France when the 
intellectual property is concerned, we refeer to the Intellectual Property 
Rights.
You can find a copy of it here : <a href="http://www.rabenou.org/cpil.html">http://www.rabenou.org/cpil.html</a>

To sum up, here is defined what is an artistic work, the patrimonial 
right of the author, the moral rights etc ... all kind of author rights.
Note that compilations and translation are artistic works.

Let's have a deeper look at that part : Article L.131-1 - Article 
L.131-8 : Exploitation des droits

Article L.131-4 :
La cession par l'auteur de ses droits sur son úuvre peut être totale ou 
partielle. Elle doit comporter au profit de l'auteur la participation 
proportionnelle aux recettes provenant de la vente ou de l'exploitation.
Toutefois, la rémunération de l'auteur peut être évaluée 
forfaitairement dans les cas suivants:

1° La base de calcul de la participation proportionnelle ne peut être 
pratiquement déterminée;
2° Les moyens de contrôler l'application de la participation font 
défaut;
3° Les frais des opérations de calcul et de contrôle seraient hors de 
proportion avec les résultats à atteindre;
4° La nature ou les conditions de l'exploitation rendent impossible 
l'application de la règle de la rémunération proportionnelle, soit que la 
contribution de l'auteur ne constitue pas l'un des éléments essentiels 
de la création intellectuelle de l'úuvre, soit que l'utilisation de 
l'úuvre ne présente qu'un caractère accessoire par rapport à l'objet 
exploité;
5° (Loi N° 94-361 du 10 mai 1994) En cas de cession des droits portant 
sur un logiciel;
6° Dans les autres cas prévus au présent Code.&lt;/PRE&gt;


In other words, the author can make a transfer of right, full or 
partial.  But this transfer gots to have a proportional remuneration to the 
author. Proportional to what ? The selling or the exploitation of the 
work.
The listed cases define some exeption to this law : instead of a 
proportional remuneration, you can have a contractual remuneration.

The articles from L.132-1 to L.132-17 are related to the contracts.
We have in the L.132-6 Article another case where contractual 
remuneration could be choose instead of proportional one. 
For a first edition of Scientifics Abstracts, Encyclopedia, 
Illustrations of a book, prayer books (!!!), cheap book for childrens etc ... 
It's the same for the journalism

That's for the Edition contract. There are other ones, you can have a 
presentation of them one the 
<a href="http://www.calcre.com/res/sto/typolo.htm">CALCRE</a> site.
With these contracts, you can find an alternate way of editing your 
works, because, as the CALCRE said, and as we'll see it later, with the 
classical edition contract : 
"Soit que le pourcentage de droits d’auteur devienne scandaleusement 
bas, soit que l’éditeur pratique une rémunération forfaitaire là où elle 
n’est pas justifiée, soit enfin qu’il profite de certaines ambiguïtés 
juridiques pour minorer l’assiette des droits d’auteur (c’est-à-dire 
leur base de calcul)."
The alternates can let all the rights to the authors. The distributors 
are seen there as they'd have to be seen : as a SERVICE
	
Articles from L.321-1 to L.321-12 tells us that author can use Society 
of Authors to recieve their due. These one are often choose for 
musical, multimedia, computer programs authors
It's not the case for the book :
En d'autres termes, l'éditeur, sauf exception, ne paye pas directement 
l'auteur mais il partage la rémunération en provenance de la société 
d'auteur. Au contraire, dans la matière de l'édition littéraire, c'est 
bien l'éditeur qui verse directement à l'auteur ses redevances. Il en est 
ainsi parce que les éditeurs et les auteurs compositeurs, membres de 
sociétés d'auteur ont donné à celles-ci l'autorisation de gérer leurs 
droits. C'est donc, dans la plupart des cas, ces sociétés elles seules qui 
perçoivent la rémunération pour l'exploitation de l’œuvre et la 
rétrocèdent ensuite aux ayants droit.
<a href="http://www.chanson.ca/musiconseils/documentation/editionmusicale.html">http://www.chanson.ca/musiconseils/documentation/editionmusicale.html</a>

So, we now have a first small representation of the general "artistic 
field" in France :

             transfer of rights
Authors -----------------------------&gt; Editors
    ^                    		   ^ 
    | royalties                            |             
    Editors does a transfer of rights to the Society of Authors too
    |                     royalties        |
 Society of Authors -----------------------  

To finish with the law, you can find here an information report from 
the French National Assembly to the EU about the opening of the european 
art market 
<a href="http://www.assemblee-nat.fr/2/sae/rap-info/i1965.pdf">http://www.assemblee-nat.fr/2/sae/rap-info/i1965.pdf</a>
I haven't read it in detail, but it could be usefull for the next part
(internationalisation of our data ) 
<hr>
So ... at that time we know that authors can suscribe to a Society of 
Authors. Who are they ?

<a href="http://www.sacem.fr">SACEM</a>: Music
<a href="http://www.sacem.fr/percevoir/conditions.html">http://www.sacem.fr/percevoir/conditions.html</a>
5% on TV exploitation, 6% on Radio exploitation

	"La plupart des auteurs d'oeuvres de l'esprit ont confié à une société 
de gestion collective, notamment la SACD, la SACEM, la SCAM..., le soin 
de délivrer en leur nom les autorisations pour la représentation et la 
reproduction de leurs oeuvres. Ces sociétés d'auteur se sont regroupées 
dans la SDRM pour gérer spécifiquement le droit de reproduction 
mécanique."

Most authors have entrusted society of authors to deliver in 
their name the authorisation for representation and reproduction of their 
works. These society groups under the 
<a href="http://www.sacem.fr/percevoir/sdrm/index.html">SDRM</a> (La Société pour 
l'Administration du Droit de Reproduction Mécanique des Auteurs, 
Compositeurs et Editeurs ) to  manage the copyright of their works.
	On the SDRM site, we can find the wanted percentage that was our target:	
<a href="http://www.sacem.fr/percevoir/sdrm/prod5.html">http://www.sacem.fr/percevoir/sdrm/prod5.html</a>
"Le pourcentage est de 8 % sur le prix de vente au détail ou, à 
défaut, de 11 % sur le prix de gros publié aux détaillants (PPD)."
		
8% on the detail selling price, 11% for wholesale price. But there 
are abatements (a nice CD pocket reduce the percentage for exemple )
There's also a table for the minimum royalties on a CD.
		
SCAM : Documentary
<a href="http://www.scam.fr/">http://www.scam.fr/</a> 

SACD : Fiction, theater, dance
<a href="http://www.sacd.fr/">http://www.sacd.fr/</a>

For the cinema, we have here a

typical contract. "Proportional royalties : ..... %"

Here is a contract edition, but not with percentage, this one uses the 
method of "contractual remuneration"
<a href="http://landric.multimania.com/maitrise/animation/module4/contratedition.htm">http://landric.multimania.com/maitrise/animation/module4/contratedition.htm</a>
	
Some books editors : 

<a href="http://www.cylibris.com/bar_infos2.html">Cylibris</a>
They offer : 5% to 15% to authors, 50% on multimedia exploitation

<a href="http://granvelle.univ-fcomte.fr/cl/edition/edition.html">Couleur Locale</a>
"For a book of 150 pages, published in 200 specimens, sold 100 FF (French Francs )
- Print Cost : 15 to 30 FF 
- Librarian Stroke : from 30 to 50 % 
- the rest for the promotion
This last point exceed generally the others.
In consequence, the author owns rarely something (...)" (my poor 
translation of the interesting part)
<hr>

<hr>
I have collected some good documents, abstracts and other texts that 
discuss the subject of the author remuneration in France

<a href="http://www.u-paris2.fr/dess-dmi/articles/pla/artremaut.htm">http://www.u-paris2.fr/dess-dmi/articles/pla/artremaut.htm</a>          
If you speak french, i recommand you to read that article from a 
student in DESS of Intellectual Property.
I've extract two interesting sentences, wich i'll try to explain :

"Le taux de la rémunération proportionnelle : L’art. L 131.4 ne donne 
aucune directive : le choix du taux est donc libre, en distinguant selon 
les modes d’exploitation. Cependant contrôle du caractère non dérisoire 
du taux : un pourcentage de 2.5/100 pour la rédaction de la 
quasi-totalité des textes ne peut apparaître comme sérieux et s’apparente 
nécessairement à une fraude à la loi (TGI PARIS 16.5.1969 D 1969.630). "
It is said that the choosing of a rate for the proportional 
remuneration is free .. but there is a minus, under 2.5% it is consider as 
"ridiculous" and is liable to the law.
(on verra que le recours au forfait devient de plus en plus fréquent 
sous l’influence des nouvelles technologies). 
The use of the contractual remuneration is more and more frequent under 
the influence of new technologies

Articles from <a href="http://www.u-paris2.fr/dess-dmi/articles/plaart.htm">http://www.u-paris2.fr/dess-dmi/articles/plaart.htm</a> are 
indeed of great interest ! The newest one is an abstract about the 
Artistic License and the copyleft.


We have now some percentages on the domain of : Music, Books, Films and 
their derived
But there is some particular case. For exemple, the journalism. How 
much is paid a news authors ? Is it a contractual remuneration, or a 
percentage ?
You can access here to the site of the Journalists Trade Union where it 
is discussed
<hr>
I think we have now a good base about the author remuneration in 
France. We can go a bit further trying to understand better the "artistic 
field" as we did a little above
A simple search on google with "filière du disque" gives interesting 
results :

www.sodec.gouv.qc.ca/etudes/pdf/ind_disque.pdf
It's located in Canada, i agree, but i think they are kinda valuable in 
france too 

On a 15.39$ Disc :
4.29$ to the Editors
1.41$ to musicians
0.84$ to author and compositor
1.44$ for the manufacture
2.96$ to the retailer
1.83$ to the under distributor
2.55$ to the main distributor"

<a href="http://www.sorbonne-av.edu/ancien_site_dess/fonds/synthese_filiere/synthese_filiere.html">http://www.sorbonne-av.edu/ancien_site_dess/fonds/synthese_filiere/synthese_filiere.html</a>
Details about the artistic fields 


Now, we can try to generalise our information to the EU, and maybe 
later to the world :

Valuable information about the intellectual property can be found here:
<a href="http://www.ipr-helpdesk.org/t_fr/home.asp">http://www.ipr-helpdesk.org/t_fr/home.asp</a>

Go here to access information about each country : 
<a href="http://www.ipr-helpdesk.org/t_en/p_001_en.asp">http://www.ipr-helpdesk.org/t_en/p_001_en.asp</a>
	
<a href="http://www.assemblee-nat.fr/2/sae/rap-info/i1965.pdf">http://www.assemblee-nat.fr/2/sae/rap-info/i1965.pdf</a>
On the pdffed report of the national assembly, we have a nice table that sum 
up for us the legal rate in some EU countries on page 27.
Here are some extracts :

<b>France :</b>  rate : 3%   thresold : 100FF  | managing of the 
rights by a society or individually
<b>Belgium :</b>rate : 4%   thresold : 50 000FB
<b>Espana :</b> rate : 3%   thresold : 300.000 Pesetas
<b>Sweden :</b>rate : 5% (...)

For the USA, a good start could be  the &lt;a 
href="<a href="http://lcweb.loc.gov/copyright/">US Copyright Office Homepage</a>

To sum up, there are multiples way to distribute artistic works, but 
few gives more that 10% on the sales to the author.
The artistic field is far too long :)
I believe the power of Internet's going to help the mutation of this 
field. Authors can promote and sell their book themselves on the net. No 
need to use Editors, Distributors etc ..

To point out that believe, i give you some links 'bout that mutation :

<br>

Here is my revised version of SCHOUMNUS ~Veliti~ September 2001<br><br>
<center><font size=+3>"A very inferior attempt @ SCHOUMNUS"
</font></center><pre>

Well searching is - as Fravia puts it - all Lore.  
It definitely is no science.  
Well to start out the importance of searching is so evident now a days. 
You want to learn more about any subject;) its out there. 
With many diffrent views on the subject.
For instance with the SCHOUMNUS Lab exercise. 
Its just a series of questions that needed to 
be  answered. And as you'll see you will get many different 
answers that you will have to evaluate. 

The way I see it there is five questions to answer
		1. How much money will media loose during the next year
		2. How much advertisment budget will be diverted toward the web
		3. Are people clicking more or less
		4. Visual tricks used to lure clicking
		5. How much does an advertisment campaign on the web cost

The next step is to figure out some keywords to begin with and then we 
will refine as we go.
		+banner* +advertisement
Well we've learned persuing Googles' archive that with the above 
keywords
		A. CPM= average banner cost per 1000 views
		B. Ad Click Rate= how often an ad gets clicked
		C. Theres an Internet Advertising Bureau
		
	Also some new keywords to look up
		+"internet statistics"
		+"market research"
		+advertising spending by media
		+internet and web revenue*
		+"advertising confidence index"
		+earning* report
		+revenue*

There! Now I think we're ready for the first question.
1. How much money will the media loose during the next year?
		Keywords- earnings report
			- revenues
			- media
			- "advertising confidence index"
  Here's some links that stand out:
  	myers.com/research/reports/me_confidence_pass.html
  	availme.com/boa4/market.index.jsp?x=market.industry23.html
  	availme.com/boa4.market.index.jsp?x=market.industry1.html
  	msdw.com/techresearch/inetad/
  	msdw.com/techresearch/inetad/iadc0222.pdf

Basicly even though a lot of "reports" say advertising budgets are 
going to increase for the year, the earning reports all say the same thing...
its getting tougher &amp; tougher for media companies to make money. 
Advertising seditment is going down as well.

2. How much advertising budget will be diverted toward the web?
  		Keywords- market*
  			- advertis*
  			- budget*
  			- internet
  Here's some links that stand out:
  	webadvantage.net/tip_archive.cfm?tip_id=153&amp;&amp;a=1
  	webadvantage.net/tip_archive.cfm?tip_id=74&amp;&amp;a=1
  	thestandard.com.au/metrics/display/0,1283,978,00.html

There's not much reading between the lines with this one, 60-65% of 
revenues go toward marketing. With advertising spending being the number one 
expense.
This link is also very interesting; 
internetnews.com/IAR/article/0,,12_449801,00.html
this and many other articles that are all over the net about this issue
all say the same thing that, "shift away from relativey expensive TV 
advertising to online advertising and marketing. 

The percent of marketing budgets spent 
online increased to 59 percent in Q2 from 48 percent in Q1."

3. Are people clicking more or less?
		Keywords- "äverage click rate"
			- banner*
  Here's some links that stand out:
  	mrnews.com/12ts3ny/news/nnr-0401.html

Average click rates drop 37% to only a big 0.58%. That means for every 
200 ad impressions there is ONE click. Now thats real low and the follow 
through with the clicks is even lower meaning not everyone that clicks 
makes a purchase.

4. Visual tricks used to lure clicking.
		Keywords- advertis*
			- strategy
  Here's some links that stand out:
  	deca.org/7UPChallenge/webad.htm
  	webreference.com/dev/banners/research.html
  	adage.com/interactive/articles/19970113/article3.html
  	adage.com/interactive/articles/19960304/article1.html

So we see that there are many tricks to grap the users attention. There
are even contests to create "the greatest eye cathing banner".
Colours: Eye grabbing colours
Animation: Movement grabs users attention; frames
Frequency: A user must see the banner often
Placement: Banner gets more clicks next to the right scroll
	   @ the top &amp; bottom of page
	   third of the page down etc.
Enticing Words: Free, Click Here, etc.

5. How much does an advertising campaign on the web cost?
		Keywords- CPM
			- advertis*
			- campaign
			- average
  Here's some links that stand out:
  	msdw.com/techresearch/inetad/inetad01.pdf  --&gt;pg.38

All sites use CPM as a measure of how exspensive advertisng will be on 
their site. The average CPM is $30.00 dollars. 
The average marketing campaign will spend about $10,000 dollars 
on advertising "for the web" while a marketing campaign "on television" 
would cost - on average - $340,000 dollars.

So in conclusion if it cost $30 dollars to make 1000 people see an ad 
(CPM) that means 5 people will end up clicking that ad (Ad click rate). 
Thats 5 potential customers for only $30 dollars. A big cost difference 
in comparison to the old way - that used to be 'the only way' - television.  
Which probably explains why this avenue of advertising is so interesting 
for the advertisers and why they pour so much money into learning how to 
make it work.

First off I would like to apologize for my short comings in my essay 
for 
this lab exercise.  For I have very little interest in following this 
research topic in depth, but merely wish to complete the lab2 section.  
So 
just keep in mind that this is the bare minimal for such a topic that 
actually resembles a <a href="http://www.therapyfodder.com/images/fractals/cobweb.jpg">cobweb.jpg</a> of 
conflicting stories.  Getting to the 'truth' of such a topic would 
trully 
require some time consuming stalking activity.  So I will give you some 
links on the subject that I believe to hold some interest and let you 
evaluate on your own from there.  Anyways heres a try...
<br><br>
First off I need to understand the subject of BSE so Googles' directory 
on 
BSE will help 
<a href="http://directory.google.com/Top/Science/Technology/Food_Science/Consumer_Concerns/BSE_-_Bovine_Spongiform_Encephalopathy/">http://directory.google.com/Top/Science/Technology/Food_Science/Consumer_Concerns/BSE_-_Bovine_Spongiform_Encephalopathy/</a>
<br>
This link is really worth looking at  
<a href="http://www.europarl.eu.int/conferences/bse/a4002097_en.htm">http://www.europarl.eu.int/conferences/bse/a4002097_en.htm</a> -BSE 
inquiry.  It 
seems the cattle farmers (for breeding reasons), rendering companies... 
basically the whole Agricultural community, and those in the government 
dealing with Agriculture are to blame.  <a href="http://www.bseinquiry.gov.uk/" target=_blank>http://www.bseinquiry.gov.uk/</a> 
gives 
an extensive amount of letters, documents, memos etc.  For a list of 
cattle 
breeds originating in Europe- 
<a href="http://www.ansi.okstate.edu/breeds/region/f-europe.html" target=_blank>http://www.ansi.okstate.edu/breeds/region/f-europe.html</a>.  For a listing 
of 
Animal Feed Manufacturers

<a href="http://www.gm-info.org.uk/gm-info/briefings/abn.html" target=_blank>http://www.gm-info.org.uk/gm-info/briefings/abn.html</a> is a very large 
animal 
feed manufacturer which has admitted to using practices that are known 
to 
transmit BSE.  Now in the EP Report on BSE(a4002097) we see that BSE 
was not 
a topic discussed at length.  First we must see how the EU works and 
who 
'gets issues discussed'. 
-<a href="http://europa.eu.int/comm/dg10/eur_dial/97i5a3s0.html" target=_blank>http://europa.eu.int/comm/dg10/eur_dial/97i5a3s0.html</a>   So it seems 
these 
business men have a lot of power, considering they control all 
proposals 
that reach EU ministers.  So the blame must be particially there fault- 
<a href="http://burmafund.org/Pathfinders/Research_Library/BAD/bad%belgium.htm" target=_blank>http://burmafund.org/Pathfinders/Research_Library/BAD/bad%belgium.htm</a>  
<br>
And 
since they are business men it would seem their interests lay with 
money.-<a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/lobbyists/98industry.htm" target=_blank>http://www.opensecrets.org/lobbyists/98industry.htm</a>
<a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/lobbyists/index.asp" target=_blank>http://www.opensecrets.org/lobbyists/index.asp</a>
<a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/lobbyists/lookup.asp?firm=ON&client=ON&lobbyist=ON&txtName=agriculture&B1=OK" target=_blank>http://www.opensecrets.org/lobbyists/lookup.asp?firm=ON&client=ON&lobbyist=ON&txtName=agriculture&B1=OK</a>
Next we see in a4002097 that the EU Commissioners were also at fault- 
<a href="http://europa.eu.int/comm/commissioners/index_en.htm" target=_blank>http://europa.eu.int/comm/commissioners/index_en.htm</a>
<br><br>
Now the whole thing starts getting really interesting when we start to 
look 
into certain committees.   MAFF- 
<a href="http://www.maff.gov.uk/animalh/bse/index.html" target=_blank>http://www.maff.gov.uk/animalh/bse/index.html</a>  these guys tried to keep 
a 
lid on the BSE problem.

<br><br>
Theres a short list at the end of this with many other names, to many 
to 
list them all.
<br><br>
Why would anyone put so many lives at risk?<br>
Maybe for more profit and advancement in their career-<br>

<br><br>
Why would MAFF try to keep such an important topic 'quite'?<br>
Maybe for $$$- <br>

-MLC (a lobbyist group for meat &amp; livestock)- <a href="http://www.mlc.org.uk/" target=_blank>http://www.mlc.org.uk/</a> 
the 
funny thing about this group is their the ones that supply most of the 
information the government relies on.  Also get this, their 
responsibilities 
include human and animal health as well as promotion of beef products.<br>  
Thats  kind of conflicting interests, don't you think?
<br><br>
Anyways I'm tried of writing and I'm sure you all can read a4002097.  
I'll 
just leave you with a incomplete, unorganized list you can persue at 
leisure.

Wow, what a list of names, and thats just the tip of the iceberg.  But 
what 
can one do exactly with a list of names.  Well this is a lab on 
stalking so 
lets stalk.<br>  To give an example, my target will be H.E. Mr. Manfred 
Scheich 
of COREPER.  Lets gather some information on our target ie. where he 
works 
(city its in, cities around it), what school he went to etc. <br>
<a href="http://www.sigov.si/svez/uk/_doc/_articles/konf_portoroz/CV_Manfred.pdf">http://www.sigov.si/svez/uk/_doc/_articles/konf_portoroz/CV_Manfred.pdf</a>   
The more info the better, you can get a real feel for the target.  Now 
we 
know the Mr. Scheich is a Former Permanent Representative of the 
Republic of 
Austria, so chances are he will live in his beloved country of Austria. <br> 
Now 
depending on the country you may need a map to locate some surrounding 
areas, but for this target that won't be nessary.  Lets use 
Infospace.com 
and look him up in the phonebook :). <br> There he is 
<a href="http://kevdb.infospace.com/intldb/kevdb?OTMPL=%2Fres%2Fr1.html&QFM=N&QK=5&KCFG=AT&QN=scheich&QF=manfred&QC=">http://kevdb.infospace.com/intldb/kevdb?OTMPL=%2Fres%2Fr1.html&QFM=N&QK=5&KCFG=AT&QN=scheich&QF=manfred&QC=</a> 
<br>    Now of course this person would have to be cross checked and 
confirmed 
but thats it.  Heres some links (some maybe broken... did not check)

<br>
<br><i>How often did you hear that one? "There are not and there never will be two snowflakes alike". </i>
<br>
<br>A simple query on "similar snowflakes" on google leads to an <a href="http://www.stny.com/wbng/wx/stwintermikerandal.pdf">interesting pdf file</a>,wich i used as a starting point.  Here, we see that a more exact ( in term of signal intensity ) sentence is "no two snowflakes are alike". It would have been too easy if +F just have pasted it instead of "There are not and there never will be two snowflakes alike". No M (mechanical) mode allowed :p
<br>
<br>So, what's interesting in that pdf ? Two major output : 
<br><b>Wilson Bentley</b>, an american photographer, worked  on 6000 snowflakes, viewing them on microscope, to see if he could find identical one ( omg  ... ). Guess what ? He failed :)  That was during the beginning of the 20th centuary.
<br>The second major output for us  is that there is a <b>Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado,</b>who  found two very similar snowflakes. It is not said that they were identical ...
<br>
<br>We've got a starting point now :)
<br>
<br>-----
<br>
<br>Now, let's find who's that Bentley dude. 
<br>
<br>http://www.snowflakebentley.com/
<br>Wilson A. Bentley The Snowflake Man
<br>
<br><i>From the earliest memories of our childhood, many of us can remember hearing the phrase "no two snowflakes are alike". This discovery was made in the small rural town of Jericho, Vermont by Wilson A. Bentley (1865-1931). 
<br>A self educated farmer, Bentley attracted world attention with his pioneering work in the area of photomicrography, most notably his extensive work with snow crystals (commonly known as snowflakes). By adapting a microscope to a bellows camera, and years of trial and error, he became the first person to photograph a single snow crystal in 1885.
<br>He would go on to capture more than 5000 snowflakes during his lifetime, not finding any two alike. His snow crystal photomicrographs were acquired by colleges and universities throughout the world and he published many articles for magazines and journals including, Scientific American and National Geographic. 
<br>In 1931 his book "Snow Crystals", containing more than 2400 snow crystal images, was published by McGraw-Hill but has long been out of print. A soft cover copy, identical in all respects, can be obtained today from Dover Publications, Inc.. On December 23, 1931, Bentley died at the family farmhouse in Jericho. Because of his wonderful work with snow crystals, he became affectionately known as "Snowflake" Bentley. </i>
<br>
<br>I want to SEE some &#33; :)
<br>http://www.snowflakebentley.com/snowflakes.htm
<br>blah ... 
<br>
<br>To fill your eyes with beautifull pictures taken by the "Snowflake man" in 1902, try here instead : http://www.photolib.noaa.gov/historic/nws/wea02069.htm to wea02098.htm
<br>
<br>
<br>hemm, there is another hunt for the snowflakes ? Did +F ripped it ? :p
<br>http://www.kn.pacbell.com/wired/fil/pages/huntsnowflakmr2.htm
<br><i>an Internet Treasure Hunt on Snowflake Bentley</i>
<br>
<br>anyway, we can use some of these ressources (i didit to find the KNES engine)
<br>
<br>We know enough on Bentley for our challenge. Let's go deeper. Does his work valuable nowaday ? After reading his articles, can we say : No there can't be two identical snowflakes ? 
<br>
<br>http://www.snowflakebentley.com/wwwboard/messages/24.htm
<br><i>Wilson Bentley was the originator of the well-known saying that no two snowflakes are alike, yet on page 43 of his book, Snow Crystals, the top two snow crystals in the center column are very much alike. </i>
<br>
<br>haha &#33;
<br>
<br><i>They are alike because the same photograph mistakingly was used for both of them, though the upper photo has been rotated 60 degrees clockwise from the lower one.</i>
<br>
<br>duh &#33;
<br>
<br><i>So put the flag away. Bentley's famous saying is still true</i>
<br>
<br>Can i believe you dude ? :) (posted on August 01, 2000 at 15:16:52 ... at least it is recent)
<br>Hmmm ...  that <a href="http://snowflakebentley.com/wwwboard/index.htm">board</a> is related to snowflakes, that guys MUST know what they say &#33;
<br>To be sure, we could do a REALLY fast stalking on Duncan Blanchard to find if he is reliable.
<br>
<br><i>Duncan C. Blanchard holds degrees in engineering (B.S., Tufts, 1947), physics (M.S., Penn State, 1951), and meteorology (Ph.D., MIT, 1961), and has conducted research in the atmospheric sciences at General Electric, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, and the Atmospheric Sciences Research Center, SUNY-Albany. He has published more than 150 articles and books. His book From Raindrops to Volcanoes, written for a popular audience, has been printed in seven languages.
<br>
<br>Blanchard has long held an interest in Bentley's life.  A natural affinity developed due to Bentley's work with snow crystals and Blanchard's interest in the development and growth of snowflakes, snow crystals, raindrops, and the seeding of clouds.</i>
<br>
<br>Do you think he is reliable according to <a href="http://www.searchlores.org/evaluate.htm">Sielaff's lessons</a> ? 
<br>
<br>-----
<br>
<br>Now, let's go <a href="http://www.ucar.edu/ucar/search.html">searching</a>  the National Center for Atmospheric Research we saw sooner. Can we find the two identical snowflakes they thinked having found ?
<br>
<br>http://www.ucar.edu/imagelibrary/1167-1199.html
<br>1175 Snowflakes (Two Identical)
<br>
<br>Hmm .. not really helping, but interesting :)
<br>
<br>-----
<br>
<br>Using the KNES engine on the  Filamentality (don't ask why that name...) querying "snowflake alike", we can collect lots of information usefull to go deeper in our challenge.
<br>
<br>http://www.cco.caltech.edu/~atomic/snowcrystals/
<br><i>This site is all about snow crystals and snowflakes.  Although a common meteorological phenomenon, snow crystal growth is a fascinating and poorly understood process, in which remarkably complex and beautifully symmetric structures appear, quite literally, out of thin air.   The many facets of snow crystals are described here, along with our attempts to understand their formation.</i>
<br>
<br>I'm sure we'll find all we want there :)

<br>http://www.its.caltech.edu/~atomic/snowcrystals/photos/photos.htm
<br>
<br>From that last one, we can have a list of photographs who had work on that subject : 
<br>1931 -- Wilson A. Bentley
<br>1954 -- Ukichiro Nakaya
<br>1969 -- Edward LaChapelle
<br>1981 -- Schaefer and Day
<br>1984 -- Kobayashi and Kuroda
<br>1994 -- Walter Tape
<br>1994+ -- William Wergin
<br>1997 -- Walter Wick
<br>2000 -- Patty Rasmussen
<br>2000 -- Yoshinori Furukawa (fiewwww ... his photos are ... fascinating. Check his site : http://www.lowtem.hokudai.ac.jp/~frkw/english/aletter.html)
<br>
<br>To finish with that site, we can check its reliability with a "combing like" raging search query :
<br>+link:"http://www.its.caltech.edu/~atomic/snowcrystals" : About 348 pages found.   
<br>+link:"snowcrystals.net" : About 3 pages found
<br>+link:"http://www.its.caltech.edu/~atomic/snowcrystals" +domain:edu :  About 64 pages found.
<br>+link:"http://www.its.caltech.edu/~atomic/snowcrystals" +domain:gov : About 2 pages found.   
<br>
<br>imho, this site can be considered as a reference ...

<br>A recent way of taking pictures of snowflakes is the Electron microscopy. Seems to appear on 1994 with William Wergin. Let's look closer

<br>I don't know if that's an answer to the challenge ... i believe we can't find two identical ones, for the same reasons that we can't really mesure the britain coast ...  
<br>I don't want to look to thousand of pictures to be sure of it, i've got other things to do in my life - all my respects are deserved to Bentley .. he was from that kind of dreamers i RESPECT -
<br>
<br><i>I wouldn't trade places with Henry Ford or John Rockefeller for all their millions&#33; And I wouldn't change places with a king: not for all his power and glory. I have my snowflakes&#33;</i> -- Bentley
<br>
<br>Seekers can find the truth, if saying that bentley was right is a truth ... can we WRITE the truth ?
<br>
<br><i>let's see IF and HOW different they really are. </i>
<br>We can build a big gallery with all the snowflake pictures we found, and try to use an algorithm to compare them ... but that can't work. That's only pictures. We don't have the ressource of the Snow Crystal Research.
<br>
<br>I didn't use the suggestions (Fractals, Infinite, Mathematical algos, fuzzy...) as a core for my seeking. 
<br>
<br>I am a children of the Chaos ( cf B. Sapoval's publications )

<hr></fonT><i>Some tips before leaping into it</i>:<ol><lI>
How easy (or difficult) was it to figure out the correct approach? </li><li>
Was the  formulation adequate to help you plan your search?</li><li> 
Which search-approaches and strategies did you choose?</lI><li>
Did you use any "classical" search engine? If so which ones?</li><li>
Did you use any "special" search engine? If so which ones?</li><li>
How many results did you retrieve?  </li><li>
What proportion of the results were relevant to your perceived information requirements?   </li><li>
How current were the results? How many 404s?        </li><li>
Was the amount of detail displayed with the results enough to allow you tho evaluate?  </li><li>
Was the order in which the results were displayed evident or apparently illogical?  </li><li>
What other features contribute to (or detract from) the utility of the tools and approaches you choosed? </li><lI>
Did you time your query?
</lI></ol>
<i>Eh, of course you don't need to answer all the questions above. The purpose of these 
labs is to let you understand how important it is to be more "systematic" when searching the web. You may 
hop, you may leap, you may be a grasshopper or an ant... the only decisive 
factor is the success 
of your query and the time you had to employ: you got the targets you were searching for 
quickly? You won.
