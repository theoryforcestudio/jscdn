<p><i>I'm writing this essay with the primary goal of being
anonymous while searching for files on IRC, it's not an
introduction to IRC if your looking for one of those try
   <a target=_top href="http://www.mirc.com/irc.html">here</a>. Its secondary
   goal is to allow you to stay anonymous while searching for
   information by whatever means necessary,  be that <a href="trolls.htm">trolling</a> or 
<a href="stalking.htm">stalking</a> or other methods. IRC has its own little mini cultures
   all huddled into their own corners, you just have to know which
   rock to turn over to get the information you need. But overall
   this essay can probably be used for other purposes, such as
   annoying the lonesome people who sit in #teen waiting for nicks
   such as Tiffany17 to join, in other words it's entirely up to
   you what you use it for.</i></p>

<p><a name="whitfp"></a><font size="+2"><b>Why Would I Want to Hide
In the First Place</b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">There are many reasons why someone wishes to be
anonymous on IRC. The main reason is the same reason many people
wish to cloak themselves while surfing webpages. As the webpages
you surf log your visits, IRC servers log your public chats, so
anything you say in a #channel or when you /MSG someone is most
likely logged. Some IRC servers such as irc.box.sk used to publish
its public channel logs onto its website. If the servers logging
you wasn't bad enough, the people who sit in the channels often log
as well. Included in these logs is your nickname, your username if
your on a public machine with ident (getting less and less common
these days) your IP address/hostmask and whatever you talk about in
the channel. These things are the cornerstone of stalking someone
or stealing their identify, your IP address can be traced back to
what country and maybe even city with a simple <a target=_top href=
"http://samspade.org/">whois</a> query, after that they just have
to narrow it down by combing and klebing through databases such as
the web to see if you posted to any message boards or sites. Armed
with information like your ICQ number and interests, which they
might have got from sites or posts you made to usenet they can
close the gap even more by looking up your ICQ user details which
may have your real name in it. I recently stalked someone on the
~S~ message board using these tricks, but he will remain nameless
:) you know who you are.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">So your thinking so what, I don't leave paper
trails around the web for people to follow. Well that's a good
defense against stalkers, but there are a lot of people interested
in what goes on in IRC with a few more resources at hand. The two
examples that I can recall is firstly a <a target=_top href=
"http://www.projectgamma.com/news/archive/1999/november/111999-1937.shtml">
hit</a> by the BSA, arresting a few kids with cable modems who were
distributing warez. After this happened a lot of suspicious people
started to appear on the IRC networks, people who actually filled
out their real name fields in their clients with what appeared to
be real names. They used to talk conservatively, with no hint of
any chat slang, which made them stick out like a sore thumb. They
disappeared after a few days, or at least stopped having such a
blatant presence, but it wouldn't surprise me if they and many
others on the commercial side of things patrol around on IRC these
days. The Second example of what roams around IRC other than
stalkers and anti-(warez/porn) agencies, is journalists. They love
a good story, especially one that smells of billions of dollars
lost, here's a good one regarding ebooks "<a target=_top href=
"http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,38945,00.html">Pirates
invade book publishing</a>". The day after the article was
published along came the commercial zombies again, not BSA this
time but people with the same inability to actually cloak
themselves from looking like a corporate suit inside a crowd of
tshirts and jeans.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The other threats you might encounter on IRC
other than logging and stalking, are mainly people trying to
exploit trojans or holes in your operating system. Most of these
type of attacks can be blocked with a firewall such as <a target=_top href=
"http://www.kerio.com/us/kpf_home.html">kerio personal
firewall</a>, and a brain. The people just a little bit higher up
in the echelon from the zombies who are infected with trojans, is
the ones who actually try to infect you with them (they were
probably infected themself not so long ago and thought gee what a
great thing to do), they run scripts which when you join a channel
will auto send you a .pif or a .vbs, with the name of
britneyspearsnude.jpg.pif, or some other zombie keyword, dumb? oh
yes, but it infects 1000s of people running windows which has a
habit of turning off file extensions by default. One attack which
is harder to avoid is DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service), its
more popular on IRC networks that don't use nickname registration
services such as <a target=_top href="http://www.efnet.org/">EFnet</a>, if you
happen to use a nick that someone else thinks they *own*, they
often try to send so much data down your connection that you get
disconnected from IRC or the net altogether. The only solution to
this attack is cloaking your IP, and this is only a partial
solution.</font></p>
<p><a name="moh"></a><font size="+2"><b>Methods of
Hiding</b></font></p></div></center>
<ul>
<li>
<div align="left"><font size="+1"><b>The
Basics</b></font><font size="+1"><br>
 Firstly, when you setup your IRC client, you have to input details
like your nick/email/realname, I shouldn't really have to tell you
<b>not</b> to put your real email and name if you wish to stay
anonymous, but just for clarity, <b>don't put your real email or
name in there</b> :), got that? good. Secondly there are modes you
can set in IRC from your client that can help with people trying to
stalk you. Nearly all IRC servers support +i, which means
invisible, it unfortunately doesn't make you invisible to where
people can't see you, all it does is stop people using commands
like /who. The /who command can be used with wildcards, so to find
someone on say aol.com you just issue /who *.aol.com and the server
will give you a list of users on aol that's not using +i, /mode
yournick +i will turn this mode on. Another mode which is
unfortunately not supported on many servers is +x, this one
actually does something useful and cloaks your IP address from
anyone other than IRCops, so if its there turn it on, /mode
yournick +x</font></div></li>
<li><font size="+1"><b>Proxies</b> (The Free Option to IRC
Anonymity)</font><br>
 <font size="+1">Ahh ye olde proxy, what we do without you.
Unfortunately there's drawbacks to using proxies on IRC, due to
mass spam most servers have proxy checks when you connect, any open
port that's on a common proxy port coming from the IP your
connecting with and the server will disconnect you for an insecure proxy. The one
exception to this rule is port 80, the web port. There are many
reasons why port 80 isn't blocked, we'll not bother with the
reasons because all were interested in is that we can proxy through
it. I won't go into finding proxies here either, there are many
<a target=_top href="http://www.searchlores.org/pro_essa.htm">essays</a> covering that subject already. Once you found your port 80
proxies, you'll need a client that can handle them, windows has
<a target=_top href="http://www.mirc.co.uk">mIRC</a> and GNU/Linux and the unix
variants has <a target=_top href="http://www.xchat.org">Xchat</a>. Setup your
client to use the web proxies (read the documents with the clients
if you can't figure out how), make sure you turn on the DCC through
proxy option, otherwise when you send/receive files your IP will
show up to the person you transfer with (unfortunately not all
proxies support this). Finally once all that's done, connect to
your desired IRC server, if it all goes smoothly it should connect
without any problems from the proxy or the IRC server. Make sure
you /whois yournick, and that your IP really is hidden. If
something does go wrong, like the proxy saying "method not supported"
you'll have to keep trying till you get one that does support it,
all in the luck of the draw :)</font></li>
<li><font size="+1"><b>Bouncers</b> (The Best Option, But Not the
Free Option)<br>
 Bouncers are basically proxies that you own/run yourself. Bouncers
allow you to connect to the IRC server by bouncing off of the
machine running the bouncer. Here's a <a target=_top href=
"http://freshmeat.net/search/?q=bnc&amp;filter=&amp;orderby=popularity_percent_DESC">
list</a> of bouncers that run on unix platforms, and here's another
<a target=_top href=
"http://directory.google.com/Top/Computers/Internet/Chat/IRC/Shell_Providers/?tc=1">
list</a> for companies that will sell you a shell service to run
them on. Overall this is the best option to mask yourself if your
planning on using IRC a lot, its also the choice of most
cracking/mp3/warez release groups which prefer for people to not
know where they are.</font></li></ul>
<p><a name="name"></a><font size="+2"><b>Choosing a Nickname That
Blends In</b></font></p>
<p><font size="+1">There was an <a target=_top href=
"http://www.searchlores.org/evillin.htm">article</a> published on
searchlores a while ago, about evil nicks and the meanings behind
them. Were not interested in evil nicks here (unless you want to
fit into some kind of underground scene channel like #2600), but we
are interested in picking one that will fit into the atmosphere of
whatever room were sitting in so we don't attract unnecessary
attention. The first thing is never use a female nickname, there
are times when a female nickname is very useful, mostly when you
want something, because men on IRC will walk upside-down and
backwards to give help to some innocent girl who appears helpless,
however for anonymity its most certainly a bad thing. The best way
to pick a nick depends on what type of channel your visiting, for
content specific channels like warez, emulation, mp3, you can pick
almost anything to do with the topics of those channels for example
warezguy/mp3guy/emuman. If your visiting a chat channel, your going
to have to put more thought into it, unlike the channels where you
get files the chat channels normally have people paying attention
to who's coming and going. If its standard chat just pick any
normal male name like brad42, if its technical like linux or
security related, names start to give you away more, especially if
your trolling in these channels. Your best bet is to use both
names, first and last (made up of course) in your nick, like say
the name was Tom Sawyer, shorten it to TSaw and put Tom Sawyer into
the real name field of your irc client.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1"><a name="beyond"></a><b><font size="+2">Topics
Beyond the Scope of This Essay</font></b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="+1">There's</font> <font size="+1">a
few things that I can think of that you may wish to look into
regarding IRC anonymity which isn't covered above, one is just a
variant of paying for a shell account like in the above section
about the bouncers, except instead of using a bouncer you just
telnet/ssh to the shell and run an IRC client like <a target=_top href=
"http://www.bitchx.org/">BitchX</a> directly from the shell itself.
Secondly a trick called DNS poisoning. By using this method you
spoof your real IP to the DNS server by cache poisoning, so when
you connect to IRC it appears that your someone else. It has a lot
more use than just hiding your IP on IRC, it also takes a lot more
effort and research to pull off since its been heavily cracked down
upon recently. For those interested SANS has an article on it
<a target=_top href="http://www.sans.org/rr/firewall/DNS_spoof.php">here</a>.
Finally, the sub7 trojan has a plugin which acts as a bouncer, but
I'm not going to write up on how to find and use infected zombie
boxes here, the best info for this I'll give you is a whitepaper
