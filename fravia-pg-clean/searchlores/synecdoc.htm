<i>Hey, this synecdochical thinghy is an old method, I know, but I try to systematize it somehow... and

A 
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=25&hl=en&q=synecdoche+term+rhetoric&btnG=Google+Search&sourceid=fravia" target="_blank">Synecdoche</a> ("sin-EK-doh-kee") is the rhetorical or metaphorical
substitution of a part for the whole, or vice versa. This approach is widely used in searching, 
because it allows you to get at your signal 'from the bottom', eliminating part 
of the noise. Synecdoche is a Greek, Latin (and at the same time English) term. 
You may peruse some linguistic variants of the term @ <a href="http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/~haroldfs/dravling/synec.html">OED</a>.
<p><font size=+2">
The 'Moundarren' field case</font><br>
Speaking  on a messageboard about haiku (maybe the supreme achievement of zen culture)
 I advised 
a friend to check the books of a French editor: Moundarren.<br>
Shortly afterwards I did myself a search for 
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Moundarren&sourceid=fravia&num=25" target="_blank">Moundarren</a> on the main search engines, and 
this
 revealed a cluster of sites -mostly French, but not only - dealing with zen, haiku, and more generally with 
Chinese and Japanese poetry. It is what I call an 'arrow' or a 'clean cut' for my target. 
Let's define as 
 '<SPAN STYLE="color: black; background: yellow">clean cut</span>'  
any search query that allows you to 'cut' through commercial crap and get 
a 'useful' or 'promising' 
cluster of sites that  provides REALLY some useful knowledge (or further pointers).
<p>
No other common denominator would have connected those specific sites, nor was the term 
Moundarren a term that those sites had ever used purposedly in order to "qualify" themselves (as opposed to 
'haiku' or 'French Publications on Zen').
<p>
Hence the use of 'Moundarren' as searching term automatically dug out (mined) a cluster of 
very specialized pages 'from the bottom'.
<p>
This kind of 'synecdochical' approach is of course already well known among seekers, but, as 
far as I am aware, it has never been 
categorized.
<p>
From the example above we can immediately derive some possible pointers, i.e. searching 
suggestions. More arrows for our search-quiver. I have decided 
to call '<font color=blue>horizontal</font>' all pointers that exploit the same 'plane' of approach (that 
in our case was an editor / publisher, but that could of course be anything you can 
devise for your own queries) and '<font color=blue>vertical</font>' those pointers that 
move to other 'query planes' while still aiming at the same target signal.
<p>
<ol><li><font color="#6633FF">an horizontal, "regional", longitude</font>:<br>
there must exist at least some other regional equivalent for non french clusters
(the best german, uk, usa, italian, spanish specialized editors)<br>

For instance 
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=30&hl=en&q=Red+Moon+Press+&btnG=Google+Search&sourceid=fravia&num=25" target="_blank">Red+Moon+Press</a>

</li><br><br><li>
<font color="#6633FF">another horizontal, "regional", longitude</font>:<br><br>
there may exist at least some other regional equivalent for clusters in the SAME area (in this case french)<br>
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=25&hl=en&q=%28%22publications+orientales%22+OR+pof%29+AND+haiku&btnG=Google+Search&sourceid=fravia&num=25" target="_blank">q=%28%22publications+orientales%22+OR+pof%29+AND+haiku</a> (publications orientales de France)

</li><br><br><li>

<font color="#6633FF">another horizontal "thematical" longitude</font>:<br><br>
if we arrive to identify the japanese editor of choice (even without knowing japanese), 
we can hit a bingo unifying different regional clusters!<br>
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=25&hl=en&q=Kodansha+International+haiku&btnG=Google+Search&sourceid=fravia&num=25" target="_blank">Kodansha International haiku</a>

</li><br><br><li>
<font color="#6633FF">a vertical, "thematical", latitude</font>:<br><br>
there must be OTHER 'uncommon' search terms that would deliver similar clusters<br>
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Izumi-shikibu&sourceid=fravia&num=25" target="_blank">Izumi-shikibu</a>
<br>
One of the problem here is the definition of 'uncommon'. Clearly many of the 
sites you dug out through 'Izumi-shikibu' would have emerged from the noise using 
 any other famous haiku poets' name like '<a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=25&hl=en&q=Shiki&btnG=Google+Search&sourceid=fravia" target="_blank">Shiki</a>',  
'<a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=25&hl=en&q=Santoka+haiku&btnG=Google+Search&sourceid=fravia" target="_blank">Santoka</a>' or '
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=25&hl=en&q=basho+haiku&btnG=Google+Search&sourceid=fravia" target="_blank">Basho</a>' 
(or -also- <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=25&hl=en&q=basho+haiku+Santoka+Shiki&btnG=Google+Search&sourceid=fravia" target="_blank">all 
three together</a>... eheh). It is in this difficult field: determining WHAT is 'uncommon', 
more 
than anywhere else, where amateur searchers make most mistakes. A deep knowledge 
of the subject you are targeting would of course help, and the more you search 
a specific subject / thread, the more you're likely to dig out pointed arrows to 
cut your own private tunnel 'under the commercial noise' towards your signal. Yet experienced seekers will also be able to 
'improvise' after a 5 minutes broad search on ANY subject. After having read this 
text all readers may try their own searches for Haiku (without using the pointers 
I have given) and be amazed at the variety of results.

</li><br><br><li>

<font color="#6633FF">a vertical, "syntactical", latitude</font>:<br><br>
Note the diaeresis in the word <font size=+3>ha<font color=blue>&#239;</font>ku</font> here, 
reflecting the French way of calling Haiku, e.g. with this search: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=ha%EFku&sourceid=fravia&num=25" target="_blank">q=ha%EFku</a>  
 we will still remain 'inside the francophonie' (we landed here with  
 the French arrow 'Moundarren' to start with, remember?)
  and yet change completely the targeted clusters...<br>
 Nota bene this <font color=blue>%EF</font> code in the query corresponds to the 
 ASCII CODE of &#239; (it's the hexadecimal value for 239... the more you understand 
 assembly the better you can search the web&nbsp;:-)<br>
 You'll find all the very useful ASCII codes at <a href="ascii.txt"  target="_blank">http://www.searchlores.org/ascii.txt</a>.<br> 
 Using such characters in your queries you will 'cut the noise' quite considerably.
<br>But it is not only a matter of fancy characters.<br>The 'correct' 
<SPAN STYLE="color: black; background: yellow">transliteration</span> of your arrows 
is also 
very important. 
<br>Unfortunately - given the euroamerican 
predominance in the development of the web -
 for many languages this is still often realized through <a href="http://libweb.princeton.edu/katmandu/sgman/sltrans.html"  target="_blank">images</a>&nbsp;:-(<br> 
Let's make a different example for our 'vertical syntactical approach': let's take the wondrous Basho 
once again. Let's search for 
"<a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=25&hl=en&q=%22bah-shoh%22&btnG=Google+Search&sourceid=fravia&num=25" target="_blank">bah-shoh</a>" 
(another way to write the name Basho).<br>
This of course re-state, once more the immense importance of <a href="nomomen.htm"  target="_blank">names</a> on 
the web.
</li><br><br><li>

<font color="#6633FF">the main vertical, "<a href="http://humanities.byu.edu/rhetoric/Figures/METONYMY.HTM" target="_blank">metonymical</a>", latitude</font>:<br><br>
Note that all the following arrows can be quickly found on the clusters you started with:

<br><a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=25&hl=en&q=tanka&btnG=Google+Search&sourceid=fravia" target="_blank">tanka</a> 
 (a poetic form that requires 31 <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=25&hl=en&q=onji&btnG=Google+Search&sourceid=fravia" target="_blank">onji</a>, and is divided into 5 lines of 5-7-5-7-7 onji each);
<br><a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=25&hl=en&q=waka&btnG=Google+Search&sourceid=fravia" target="_blank">waka</a> (too much noise, throw away this broken arrow, else 
you'll need something like <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=25&hl=en&q=%2Bwaka+%2B31+-indonesia+-bali&btnG=Google+Search&sourceid=fravia" target="_blank">+waka +31 -indonesia -bali</a> to shoot with, 31 being the syllabes 
of a waka);
<br><a href="http://www.wisenut.com/search/query.dll?q=renga" target="_blank">renga</a> (collaborative 
haiku. This search was on 
<a href="http://www.wisenut.com/jsedemo.html/" target="_blank">wisenut</a>, I'm using google elsewhere just for the examples, but you should 
ALWAYS try more than one <a href="main.htm" target="_blank">main</a> search engine, duh);
<br><a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=25&hl=en&q=senryu&btnG=Google+Search&sourceid=fravia" target="_blank">senryu</a> 
(colloquial in style, concerned with  more mundane topics than haiku. Note that you could have a special 
syntactical arrow here with <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=25&hl=en&q=senry%FB&btnG=Google+Search&sourceid=fravia" target="_blank">senry%FB</a> = senryû, see the previous 
synecdoche);
<br><a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=25&hl=en&q=haibun&btnG=Google+Search&sourceid=fravia" target="_blank">haibun</a> 
(combining Prosa and haiku / senryû);
<br><a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=25&hl=en&q=kigo&btnG=Google+Search&sourceid=fravia" target="_blank">kigo</a> (the 'season word' there are thousands kigo
 whose connection to a particular season is relatively arbitrary); 
<br><a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=25&hl=en&q=%22kire-ji%22+OR+%22kireji%22&btnG=Google+Search&sourceid=fravia" target="_blank">kire-ji OR kireji</a> 
(a kireji pauses the reader, like punctuation in english); 
<br><a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=25&hl=en&q=haiga&btnG=Google+Search&sourceid=fravia" target="_blank">haiga</a> (illustrations: 
this leaves 
our 'poetry environment' and cuts into a new 'pictorial' environment).

</li><br><br><li>

<font color="#6633FF">the vertical, "<a href="http://humanities.byu.edu/rhetoric/Figures/peristasis.htm" target="_blank">peristasical</a>", latitude</font>:<br><br>
Now 'the whole for the part': this is the oldest synecdochical trick of the bag, but it works wonders and deserves a specific name.
To apply it here, we will use some complete 
haiku lines as 'bait' in order to fish target clusters! 
<br>
Have a look:<br>
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=25&hl=en&q=%22a+crow+perches%22+autumn+twilight&btnG=Google+Search&sourceid=fravia" target="_blank">"a crow perches" "autumn twilight"</a>, or even better 
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=25&hl=en&q=%22karasu-no+tomari-keri%22&btnG=Google+Search&sourceid=fravia" target="_blank">"karasu-no tomari-keri"</a> which is the japanese 
for "a crow perches" and will deliver you a wealth of different translations into english (and other languages 
as well).
<br><br>
Simple name/surname peristasis for Basho:<br>
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=25&hl=en&q=%2B%22Matsuo+Basho%22&btnG=Google+Search&sourceid=fravia" target="_blank">+"Matsuo Basho"</a>, 
and for Issa (thanks Jeff):
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Kobayashi+Issa%22&sourceid=opera&num=25&sourceid=fravia" target="_blank">"Kobayashi Issa"</a>, or also: 
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=25&hl=en&q=%22Yosa+Buson%22&btnG=Google+Search&sourceid=fravia" target="_blank">"Yosa Buson"</a> and, more 
specialized, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=25&hl=en&q=%22Taniguchi+Buson%22&btnG=Google+Search">"Taniguchi Buson"</a>.
<br>

Yet this 'peristasical' approach SHOULD NOT be limited to names!  
<SPAN STYLE="color: black; background: yellow">Dates</span> or specific characteristics of your targets 
can be of great help as well:<br>
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=25&hl=en&q=%2BBasho+%2B%221644-1694%22&btnG=Google+Search&sourceid=fravia" target="_blank">+Basho +"1644-1694"</a>
<br>
<br>

Peristasis works always. It is in my opinion most useful for text searching.
The quantity of crap sites that speak about Authors but DO NOT HAVE THE COMPLETE 
TEXT (that you are looking for) can be at once 'undercut' with medium-long text strings.<br>
Let's say you want to find 
the text of an old song from Donovan... You could of 
course use the simple string <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=25&hl=en&q=%2Bdonovan+%2B%22little+pebble%22&btnG=Google+Search&sourceid=fravia" target="_blank">+donovan +"little pebble"</a>, 
but you would probably find better results with the string
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%22Thought+is+like+a+little+boat+upon+the+sea%22&btnG=Google+Search&sourceid=fravia" target="_blank">"Thought is like a little boat upon the sea"</a> which is 
part of the song you are looking for and that you casually remember.
<br> 
Similarly: you want to find Tolkien on 
the web? You shoot a long string arrow! <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=25&hl=en&q=%22taking+his+axe+the+dwarf+now+cut+several+branches.%22&btnG=Google+Search&sourceid=fravia" target="_blank">"taking his axe the dwarf now cut several branches."</a>.
<br>
Where is the 'Edictus Rothari' on the web?
<br>
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=25&hl=en&q=%22omnes+liberti%2C+qui+a+dominis+suis+langobardis+libertatem+meruerint%22&btnG=Google+Search&sourceid=fravia" target="_blank">"omnes liberti, qui a dominis suis langobardis libertatem meruerint"</a> and so on and so on.

<br>(It would be a good idea 
 to press your keyboard's 'f11' key right now&nbsp;:-)</center>
 <br><br>
The red cylinder below represents the TOTALITY of accessible web sites that 
could be of interest to you in the context of your current search, the small 
rings depict four different specific <SPAN STYLE="color: black; background: yellow">clusters</span> of interesting sites. 
<br>Please remember that <u>inside</u> the cylinder the 'void' is only APPARENT! 
That's the part 
of the internet you cannot reach through the main search engines. There are interesting sites 
there as well (as a matter of fact MUCH more than on the 'accessible' outside), but to grab them you'll have to use 
more advanced techniques than commercial engines&nbsp;:-)
<br><br>
<IMG SRC="images/synecd2.jpg"  
ALT="latilongi" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH="402" HEIGHT="441" BORDER="0" VSPACE=0 HSPACE=0>
<br>

<b>1</b>&nbsp;You land first time to an interesting cluster of sites trough your 'clean cut'<br>
<b>2</b>&nbsp;You have 'synecdochically' moved horizontally, modifying your original clean-cut<br>
<b>3</b>&nbsp;These sites will be relatively easy to find, they are both on an horizontal and on a 
vertical synecdoche. Note that the signal width of the vertical synecdoches 
(e.g. the yellow one on the right side of the image) may vary quite a lot, 
while horizontal synecdoches' width seems more costant.<br>
<b>4</b>&nbsp;You'll never find this cluster 
with your current synecdochical approaches, you'll have to 
devise a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT cut.<br><a name="conclu"</a>
<hr>
<br>
<font size=+1>To conclude:  In <b>rhetoric</b> a  <a href="http://humanities.byu.edu/rhetoric/Figures/SYNECDOCHE.HTM">synecdoche</a> 
may take two colors: 
<font color=blue>genus-species</font> or <font color=blue>part-whole</font>. In 
<b>searching</b> it may 
appear either  as a 'whole' (upper) category, that 
encompasses your original arrow in a more global concept, or - conversely - 
as a 'part' (lower) hyperspecialized term, that will allow you 
to collect more specific clusters. In both cases you may mowe either 
horizontally, remaining on the same plane of approach, yet changing your 
'angle' of attack, or you may move 
vertically, changing plane and angle of attack, while still 
aiming at the same target.<br> 
The synecdochical searching method is thus not rigid nor 
precisely quantifiable in all its vertical and horizontal marges,  
but probably best viewed as a 'continuum' whereby the 
<font color=blue>part-whole</font> or <font color=blue>species-genus</font> 
synecdoche is "simpler"... That is 'apprehensible with less prior 
knowledge of the quarry'; whereas the <font color=blue>genus-species</font> 
(or <font color=blue>class-member</font>) synecdoche is consequently "more 
complex" since it relies on more knowledge of your target and its 'habitat' 
on the web. Anyway keep 
in mind our seekers'  motto: <i>"Non refert quam multos sitos, sed quam bonos invenias"</i></font>
