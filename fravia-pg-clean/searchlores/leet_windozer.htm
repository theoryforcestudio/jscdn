Woah, bet you did not know you had already on your own harddisk -or could quickly have- all this stuff at 
your command & disposal. Useful for wardriving, anonymity purposes, or simply to have a fast running 
box despite the ballast of the overbloated and bigbrotherish windoze operating system.<br>
Yessir! And the funny thing is that plenty of the following commands and tricks 
will be available <font color=blue>on any box</font> you'll happen  to put your hands on, from Trivandrum to Lissabon, and in any "shoddy" 
  webcafé&nbsp;:-)<br><br>Ok, let's be serious now: you should use <a target=_top href="http://www.gnu.org">GNU</a>/Linux, by all means. A debian 
  <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> distribution will be the easiest step for people switching from windoze. And yet 
we will see here how even a windoze box -if you are compelled to use it- can "deliver"&nbsp;:-)<br> For instance, <a href="leet_windozer.htm#instasuppo">after having installed 
windoze's "support tools"</a>, open a dosbox and 
try e.g.: "<font color=blue>filever /SE c:\</font>"... See what I mean?<br>
And if you don't have the "support tools" yet, just try e.g. 
the <font color=blue>arp -a</font> <font color=blue>arp -s</font> sequence described <a href="leet_windozer.htm#arp">below</a>.<br>
<br>And now read what follows  and 
<font color=blue>try out all 
the various commands</font> now and again, later, once 
every five-six months or so, "lest you forget the things which your eyes have seen" ... "and teach them
to your children and to your children's children." (<font color=gray>Deuteronomy 4:9</font>)

<br><br>
 <center><font color=blue>IP</font>: "Internet Protocol" </center>
 <br>IP is the most popular network protocol in the world.<br> 
 Data travels over an IP-based network in the form of packets; each IP packet 
 includes both a header 
 (that specifies source, destination, and other information about the data) and the message data itself.
 IP supports the notion of unique addressing for computers on a network. Current IP (IPv4) addresses contain four bytes (32 bits),  
  sufficient to address most computers on the Internet. My INTERNAL 
  IP at the moment is 192.168.0.2 (coz my router is 
  192.168.0.1&nbsp;:-) but when visiting the internet, of course I will have what my provider will give me (check yours  
  <a target=_top href="http://fravia.2113.ch/phplab/showclientheader.htm">here</a>)<br>

IP supports protocol layering (OSI model, IP is layer three: network). 
Popular higher-level protocols like <font color=blue>HTTP</font> (<a target=_top href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2616.html">HyperTtext Transfer 
Protocol</a>), 
<font color=blue>TCP</font> (Transmission Control Protocol, 
OSI layer four, transport: is responsible for ensuring that a message is divided into the packets and for reassembling 
the packets back 
into the complete message at the other end. In fact IP, alone, can only deliver individual packets), 
and <font color=blue>UDP</font> (User Datagram Protocol, OSI layer four, transport: its  
packets may be dropped with no retries, it is used 
for games and videoconferences) 
are built directly on top of IP. Likewise, IP can travel over several 
different lower-level data link interfaces like Ethernet and ATM. <br><br>
IP is a <font color=blue>best-effort</font> packet delivery system. This means that 
(a) 
it delivers each packet individually and independently, 
(b) it offers no guarantee that a packet will be delivered and 
(c) 
it offers no mechanism for monitoring the success or failure of a packet delivery.
 <br><hr width=44%><br>
<center><font color=blue>DHCP</font>: "<a target=_top href="http://www.bind9.net/rfc-dhcp">Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol</a>"</center>
<br>
 DHCP allows a computer to join an IP-based network without having 
 a pre-configured IP address. DHCP is a protocol that assigns unique 
 IP addresses to devices, then releases and renews these addresses 
 as devices leave and re-join the network. 
 ISPs (providers) and wireless 
 home-routers 
 often use DHCP.
 <br>

 
  <br><hr width=44%><br>
<center><font color=blue>MAC</font> Address ("Media Access Control address")</center>
<br><br>

The MAC address is a 12-digit, hexadecimal number which is burned into all network 
interface cards (NICs).  This address uniquely identifies a specific card 
and it is ultimately used for all communications to and from the device.   
Although other people and even computer communication protocols will refer to a computer 
by different names or techniques, ultimately these other means are always 
reduced to the MAC address.  The MAC address can be thought of as 
analogous to the standard postal address of a home or business:  without a correct address, 
no mail can be delivered to the location.<br>
The first three octets (in transmission order) identify the organization which issued the identifier (see well-known MAC address list: <a target=_top href="http://www.ethereal.com/distribution/manuf.txt">http://www.ethereal.com/distribution/manuf.txt</a>), 
and are known as the <font color=blue>Organisational Unique Identifier</font> (OUI). The following three  
octets are assigned by that organization in nearly any manner they please, subject to the constraint of uniqueness.<br><br>

The format of a MAC address <font color=blue>is not important</font> and may differ depending where you see it.  
<br>The important information in the MAC address <font color=blue>is just the 12 hexadecimal digits</font>.  
<br>The punctuation is just there to make it more readable; it does not have any bearing on the MAC address itself<br>
 	Possible, valid, MAC Addresses<br>	 	
 	00904b32228e<br>	 	
 	00:06:28:2d:0e:1b<br>	 	
 	00-07-4e-b4-51-e5<br>	 	
 	0002.8a7a.f259<br>
 	 You can change it if needs be: although physical MAC addresses are permanent by design, 
 	 several mechanisms allow modification, or "spoofing", of the MAC address that 
 	 is reported by the operating system. This can be useful for privacy reasons, 
 	 for instance when connecting to a Wi-Fi hotspot that has installed some nasty MAC address filters.<br>
 	 See <a href="mac_spoofing_per_hand.htm">mac_spoofing_per_hand.htm</a><br>
 	 Also try the command <font color=blue>getmac</font>.

<br><br>

<br><hr width=44%><br>
<center><font color=blue>PORTS & SOCKETS & SERVICES (TCP & UDP)</font></center>
<br><br>

<font color=blue>Ports</font> are identified with a number between 0 and 65536. 
Each sockets based application identifies itself with a unique protocol 
port number.<br><br>

Port numbers at the client side are <font color=blue>dynamically assigned by the operating system</font> when a service 
is requested. However, port numbers for well known server side applications 
are pre-assigned by IANA and don't usually change.<br><br>

A socket is the <font color=blue>endpoint for a network communication</font>. By designating the IP address 
of a destination host, the type of service (TCP or UDP) and the port to be used, we create a socket.

<br><br>
Why do both TCP and UDP exist, instead of just one or the other?
<br>
   They supply different services.  Most applications are implemented to
   use only one or the other.  The programmer chooses the protocol
   that best meets his needs.  If you need a reliable stream delivery
   service, TCP might be best.  If you need a datagram service, UDP
   might be best.  If you need efficiency over long-haul circuits, TCP
   might be best.  If you need efficiency over fast networks with short
   latency, UDP might be best.

<h2>Syntax</h2><div id=""><p><b>ipconfig</b> [<b>/all</b>] [<b>/renew</b> [<i>Adapter</i>]] [<b>/release</b> [<i>Adapter</i>]]
 [<b>/flushdns</b>] [<b>/displaydns</b>] [<b>/registerdns</b>] [<b>/showclassid</b> <i>Adapter</i>] [<b>/setclassid</b> 
 <i>Adapter</i> [<i>ClassID</i>]]</p>
 
Most useful in order to find out your ow MAC addresses: fire a windows dos box (run --> cmd) and just enter <font color=blue>ipconfig /all</font>,  
also useful  to check that your ISP hasen't moved the DNS servers again.
<br><br>
It is the command-line equivalent to the <font color=blue>winipcfg command</font>,
There's no more a graphic winipcfg command in windoze xp, but there's an equivalent: 
use Network Connections to view and renew an IP address. 
To do this, open Network Connections, right-click a network connection, click Status, and then click the 
Support tab.
<br><br>
Note that <font color=blue>Physical address</font> == Adapter Address == the Media Access Control (MAC) address of that network card.

<a name="pathping"></a>
<br><br><font color=blue size=+2>pathping</font><br>

The PathPing tool detects packet loss over multiple-hop paths.<br> 
Run a PathPing analysis to a remote host to verify that the routers on 
the way to the destination are operating correctly. To do this, 
type the following command: <br>
<font color=blue>pathping</font> [IP address of remote host]<br>
<h2>Syntax</h2><div id=""><p><b>pathping </b>[<b>-n</b>] [<b>-h </b><i>MaximumHops</i>] [<b>-g </b><i>HostList</i>] 
[<b>-p </b><i>Period</i>] [<b>-q </b><i>NumQueries</i> [<b>-w </b><i>Timeout</i>] [<b>-T</b>] [<b>-R</b>] [<i>TargetName</i>]</p>

<br><br>
<a name="ping"></a>
<br><br><font color=blue size=+2>ping</font><br>
Testing connections
<br>
The ping command helps to verify IP-level connectivity. 
When troubleshooting, you can use ping to send an ICMP ( Internet Control Message Protocol)
 echo request to a target host name or IP address. Use 
 ping whenever you need to verify that a host computer 
 can connect to the TCP/IP network and network resources. 
 You can also use ping to isolate network hardware problems 
 and incompatible configurations.
<br><br>
It is usually best to verify that a route exists between the local 
computer and a network host by first using the ping command and 
the IP address of the network host to which you want to connect. 
Try pinging the IP address of the target host to see if it responds, 
as follows:
<br>
<font color=blue>ping IP_address</font><br>

<h2>Syntax</h2><div id=""><p><b>ping</b> [<b>-t</b>] [<b>-a</b>] [<b>-n</b> <i>Count</i>] [<b>-l </b><i>Size</i>]
 [<b>-f</b>] [<b>-i</b> <i>TTL</i>] [<b>-v</b> <i>TOS</i>] [<b>-r</b> <i>Count</i>] [<b>-s</b> <i>Count</i>] 
 [{<b>-j</b> <i>HostList</i> | <b>-k </b><i>HostList</i>}] [<b>-w</b> <i>Timeout</i>] [<i>TargetName</i>]</p>

You should perform the following steps when using ping:<br>
Ping the loopback address to verify that TCP/IP is installed and configured correctly on the local computer. 
<br><br>
ping 127.0.0.1<br>
Ping the IP address of the local computer to verify that it was added to the network correctly. 
<br><br>
ping IP_address_of_local_host<br>
Ping the IP address of the default gateway to verify that the default gateway is functioning and that you can communicate with a local host on the local network. 
<br><br>
ping IP_address_of_default_gateway<br>
Ping the IP address of a remote host to verify that you can communicate through a router. 
<br><br>
ping IP_address_of_remote_host<br>
<br><br>
The ping command uses Windows Sockets-style name resolution to resolve a computer name to an IP address, so if pinging by address succeeds, but pinging by name fails, then the problem lies in address or name resolution, not network connectivity.
<br><br> 
Here an example, pinging searchlores:<br>
<font color=blue>ping -n 2 -l 1450 66.228.199.2</font>

<pre>Pinging 66.228.199.2 with 1450 bytes of data:

<a name="netstat"></a>
<br><br><font color=blue size=+2>netstat</font><br>
"Displays active TCP connections, ports on which the computer is listening, Ethernet statistics, 
the IP routing table, IPv4 statistics (for the IP, ICMP, TCP, and UDP protocols),

 Use it to see what sockets are defined on a host. A socket can either be LISTENING or ESTABLISHED. 
 Note that  if the port is not listening and not yet established, 
 the port number is shown as an asterisk (*).
<br><br>


<br><br>
<a name="arp"></a>
<br><br><font color=blue size=+2>arp</font> (Address Resolution Protocol)<br>
 The question is: "When sending out an IP packet, how is the destination 
   address determined?"
<br>
   ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is used to <font color=blue>translate IP addresses
   to destination</font> (Ethernet) addresses.<br>
If the payload of a frame or packet contains IP data, then the MAC address is mapped to the 
IP address using the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP).<br>
"This diagnostic command displays and modifies the IP-to-Ethernet 
or Token Ring physical address translation tables used by 
the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)."<br>
In other words: IT ALLOWS YOU TO CHANGE (SPOOF) YOUR IP ON A NETWORK (wireless or not)<br>

</font>
<h2>Syntax</h2><div id=""><p><b>arp</b> [<b>-a </b>[<i>InetAddr</i>] [<b>-N</b> <i>IfaceAddr</i>]] [<b>-g </b>[<i>InetAddr</i>] 
[<b>-N</b> <i>IfaceAddr</i>]] [<b>-d</b> <i>InetAddr </i>[<i>IfaceAddr</i>]] [<b>-s</b> <i>InetAddr EtherAddr </i>[<i>IfaceAddr</i>]]</p>
<font color=blue>arp -s</font>:  
Adds an entry in the ARP cache to associate the IP address inet_addr with 
the physical address ether_addr. The physical address is given as 6 hexadecimal bytes separated 
by hyphens. The IP address is specified using dotted decimal notation. The entry is static. It will not be automatically 
removed from the cache after the timeout expires and will not exist after a 
reboot of your computer.
<br><br>
Example: <font color=blue>arp -a</font><pre>
Interface: 192.168.0.2 --- 0x20003
  Internet Address      Physical Address      Type
  192.168.0.1           00-c0-02-b6-d4-b2     dynamic</pre> 
  And now you could, for instance, 
   change the above IP address 192.168.0.1 to 192.168.0.8:<br> 

<font color=blue>arp -s 192.168.0.8 00-c0-02-b6-d4-b2</font><br>
Now reissue the   <font color=blue>arp -a</font> command and check that you have done it&nbsp;:-)
<br><br>
The ARP table is necessary because the IP address and Ethernet
   address are selected independently; <font color=blue>you can not use an algorithm to
   translate an IP address to its destination hardware (ethernet) address</font>.

<br><br><font color=blue size=+2>ipxroute</font><br(Only if you have installed NWLink, that was installed per default 
in windows 95 and is not installed anymore automatically in windoze xp)<br>
 Displays and modifies information about the routing 
tables used by the IPX protocol (IPX is a datagram (connectionless) service 
protocol, the network protocol used by the few remaining 
NetWare computers -netware is Novell's alternative to Micropoft NT- that allows individual packets to be sent to 
and received from user processes. It does not support the 
concept of a connection or reliable delivery. However, guaranteed services (like SPX: Sequence Packet Exchange) 
can be built on top of IPX. IPX is used in situations where a guaranteed service is not 
required or where an occasional lost packet is not critical). 
Used without parameters, 
ipxroute displays the default settings for packets that are sent to unknown, broadcast, and multicast addresses.

I am assuming here that you are using windows XP. I am not saying that you <font color=blue>should</font> use windows xp, in fact 
you should use <a target=_top href="http://www.gnu.org">gnu</a>/linux, I am just assuming that you are using windows xp.
<br>
If you want to work seriously with it you'll need windows xp-pro sp2 (easy to find on the web if you don't feel like 
throwing even more money out of the gates). And -once you have it- you should by all means install the complete set 
of support tools. Some hidden gems among these HUNDRED small programs that have been first 
published with the old "Microsoft Windows 2000 Resource Kit".<br> 
Here is how you install them:

Ok, "<font color=blue>The path of the elite windoze xp warrior</font>" sounds rather ridicolous, and yet, and yet
 there are some surprises deep into the guts of windows. And the fact that 
this operating system is used all over the world -as crappy and overbloated as it is-  
will open, for those that take the time to learn and acquire <font color=blue>knowledge</font>, 
quite some possibilities to "surprise" those that do not, or maybe their own system administrators... hehe.
