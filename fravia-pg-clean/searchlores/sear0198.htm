an <U><b>archie search</u></b> and a <U><b>FTPremailer</u></b> are, you are paying your

and (if really necessary) even lure or trap targets!</center>

'to know an answer is easy, the difficult 
part is to know how to find any answer' (+ORC)

'don't waste your time doing it yourself, 
others have already done it for you' (Surreal)</prE>(Part of the following is based on some private 
emailings from Surreal: Thanx a lot Surreal :-)<br>
<hr width=44%></center><br><a name="anchorquisa"></a>
<font size=+2>Different techniques walking on the quicksand</font><bR>
<br>You want to set up a site, prepare a paper, 
find information on a hurry about a target you want to crack, the butterflies of the 
Orinoco-river, german poets of the XVI century, old M�rklin steam locs, or 
silent actresses of the 1920's cinema?<br><br>

In 90% of the problem-solution situations you are  actually desperately
trying to do something that somebody else has ALREADY DONE, in fact you are 
seeking solutions for your problem that have ALREADY BEEN FOUND. Yes, but WHERE 
on the ever-expanding and quicksand moving deep deep web? For each of your 
projects there are some different constraints and caveats, as you'll see.
<br><br>
A crack for a new version of a program could have been made a few days
before you downloaded the program. In this case, good updated warez sites 
are a lot faster (and produce far far better results) than ftp search 
engines. 
<br><br>
The butterflies throw you hundred sites that are non relevant until you learn 
how to use advanced query features to EXCLUDE all non-university sites.
<br><br>
Most sites about german poets are irrelevant or dilettantesque until you learn to 
use strings in GERMAN to find relevant sites.
<br><br>
For M�rklin steam locs you of course need more PICTURES than text, and you'll have 
to learn how to use correctly the PICTURES tags in the advanced search queries
<br><br>
silent actress sites (as well as the preceding M�rklin locs sites) are 
better found and accessed using usenet queries than search engines.
<br><br>
The main problem, searching in this way, is the "Quicksand" aspect of the 
web: if you are searching through hotbot how much snow you have NOW on the 
alpine resorts you'll visit tomorrow, you won't be alused to find ton of links 
to the snow situation 8 months ago, when hotbot visited those sites, and 
then, trying to access them, to constate that more than 50% have disappeared, 
another good 30% was never updated and the remaining 20% have changed 
sector of interest :-(<br><a name="anchorshoul"></a>
<br><hr width=44%><bR><font size=+2>When you need to find something fast</font><bR><bR>
When you need to find something fast, use infoseek and "search only in
these results" a couple of times. Infoseek is the only search engine that 
keeps getting better and better. Altavista and Hotboat, on the contrary, 
are either stable or slightly worsening. This has a lot to do with the 
awful (and totally useless) 'commercialisation' of the web. Infoseek is 'coming back' 
from too much commercialisation (started as a 'payment' search engines), 
Altavista and Hotbot are 'going towards' commercialisation. And commercialisation, 
as you know is VERY BAD, because it has absolutely nothing to do with CONTENT, that 
is what you are supposed to be seeking <i>in primis</i>.<br>As usual, history can 
help to find solutions. Web search 
engines used (many many years ago) to be no-frill EFFECTIVE search engines, 
dunnow if you know what a gopher Veronica search is... it's obsolete searching now, 
yet try it out, and compare that with 
hotbot -say, and you'll notice that not all differences are for the better.
Another aggravating commercial infection is that many search engines are 
PUSHING their results, <i>de facto</i> faking them.<br>
They filter 
results and push commercial (paying) sites and/or commercial "friends" in 
the pole positions... as if all people using them were really so idiot 
to believe that their solution should dwell among the first ten results, 
and would never care examining the remaining pages... well, may be most 
people using those search engines ARE so stupid, I don't know.
<br><br>
Anyway, when you need to find something fast, use infoseek and "search 
only in these results" a couple of times. 
When you don't find anything this way, or when you need "time sensitive" 
information, use altavista's "advanced query", or hotbot date filter, and 
specify a date. 
<br><br>
If you still don't find what you need, make a <u>filter</u> in dejanews,
which is always VERY good for clues on where to look <u>instead</u> of 
searching it. 
<br><br>
Combining these three approaches will get you to a point where you 
hardly have to drop or "forget" anything you need.  
<br><br>You can solve
95% (or more) of the problem situations (looking for info) within
max 2 hrs, with these 3 search engines/filters. If you can't find it, you can 
be 90% sure it
can't be found on the (html based) web. However, the time sensitive info will 
still be a huge problem (people don't update keywords to the search engines,
so 90% of the time sensitive info you're looking for is noise). 
<br><br>There are various tools that notify you of uploads on the web. These 
tools may also be useful for stalking purposes (unless the webmaster has 
really a LOT of free time, you will soon recognize his time patterns and 
be able to reconstruct his REAL timezone).
<bR><a name="anchormonit"></A>
<br><hr width=44%><bR><font size=+2>Site changes monitoring</font><bR><bR>

I recently came across a tool called Tierra highlights, which monitors
pages and notifies you of changes, then displays the page with the changes
made in another colour. 
<br><bR>
I don't have to tell you that some of the page
mainteiners I targeted have been the ftp uploaders for *ahem* time 
sensitive programs, so
you can see what i'm getting at, I believe.<bR><br>
I ran this proggie for the duration of the
evaluation period with the maximum nr of 15 sites and set the best pages
to update every 15 minutes. I got into the ftp sites nearly 9 out of 10 of
the times, (as i got the ftp info within 15 mins after the uploader put it
on his page). Beats the hell out of loading a page and not knowing how many
hours have gone by since it's last update (timezone delays etc).
<br><br>
Other possible uses: satelite channel codes pages, warez/passwords pages etc, 
but also realaudio pages, sensitive information pages and general stalking 
purposes.<a name="anchorprize"></a>

You may find this program at 
<a href="http://www.tierra.com/">http://www.tierra.com/</a>. 
It's protection scheme is relatively easy to reverse, I'll leave 
to my readers the pleasure of working on it right now. Consider it a small +HCU 
exercise for February: best and most elegant short solution will gain 
once lmore a "strategical" nice prize (previous prize 
has been won by +Frog's Print as you may recall)
<br><br>
I would like to hear your opinion about this and any other 
"page updating" util you know of: if you know a better tool, please let 
me know (and write maybe a small essay on it).
 <br>
 Go ahead, enjoy!<br><br>
