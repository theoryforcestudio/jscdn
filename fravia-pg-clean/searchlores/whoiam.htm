advanced web-searching: Old lore for a new science!</FONT> </center>
<hr width=44%>



<i>The following boring "biography" is tantamount to revealing my real identity to any 
average stalker, but I don't care that much and anyway I felt this was necessary: 
it is indeed pretty long-winded, but you are absolutely NOT compelled to read it. 
The reason of it's presence is that, as all searchers know, evaluating 
<b>what</b> you find on the web depends also from the "value" of the source you 
have found. And the value of a source depends a lot from its <b>Author</b> and his 
real qualifications.</i><hr> </center>
<font size=+1><IMG align=left valign=top width=9 height=40 SRC="images/dot_green.gif">I am fairly old: 
the middle of my life is behind me. 
I have programmed software for my own use 
(either in assembly or 
in C) since the early eighties, some younger readers were not yet born :-(<br> The inner working 
of computer programs (come to think of it: the <i>inner working of everything</i>) has always fascinated me.  Behind 
all the hype and the obvious progress being made in the field of software I have noticed 
during the last twenty years a clear (and saddening) "involutionary" pattern.
<BR>Software programs (software 
operating systems too, for that matter) are more and more being deliberately 
"hidden" from 
their users (as the growing appearance of "Wizards" and automated installation and 
de-installation procedures attest) and are more and more using "undocumented" 
functions and performing "clandestine" activities on user machines.<br>
<br>
Such 
<SPAN STYLE="color: black; background: yellow">covert activities</span> encompass <i>inter alia</i>:<ul><lI>
the unashamed spying of the installed software (eventually denouncing it 
(secretly) in the background during a web connection): Many recent Microsoft 
products.</li><li> 
the gathering (secretly) of information about the user and his choices and 
preferences delivering it to commercial oriented bastards for spamming ads or 
unsolicited email (web-scripts, 
web-search engines and some commercial software)</li><li>
the modification (without asking of course) of many user-parameters of the operating 
system, the deletion or modification or "updating" of user files, the fiddling with 
the physical locations of the user harddisk and so on (many protection schemes and many 
installation procedures).</li></ul>
It has always astonished me that so few even cared to check such 
developments, and that virtually nobody fought against them or tried to counter 
(or retaliate). 
I conduced a very 
lonely fight on my own, which started long ago on a Sinclair spectrum and was 
boosted with the advent of the web.
<br>
<br>
From 1995 to end-1999 I have created, through a series of avatars, 
a "first web-approach": a site that tried 
to push talented crackers (i.e. people interested in breaking software protections, hence <i>eo ipso</i> 
 well above the average -poor- consciousness scheme) into 
"more general" software reversing activities, not necessarily protection-related, in the belief that the world needs - A LOT OF - people 
capable of looking inside the little (and poor-programmed) black-boxes that 
are sold to the zombies all over the planet. 

My "<SPAN STYLE="color: black; background: yellow">pages 
of reverse engineering</span>" had quite a lot of 
success, I never really understood why.
<br>
Probably the right info at the right time. Still unclear about that, but 
I don't think I really deserved so many people reading my silly ramblings. 
<br>
Anyway the five years between 1995 and 2000 have been 
decisive. Microsoft dominance has been broken and
the 'hidden activities' performed by many a software application are now more popularly 
known - thank also to our past 
work.<br>Yet 
 I keep meeting public officials in Europe --&nbsp;even "high" EU-officials&nbsp;-- who are 
happily using Excel (or the 'public' search engines or the  so-called 'free' email 
addresses, or the "free facilities" that <i>nicht zuf&#228;llig</i> abound 
on the web) with their 
own name and IP, who are browsing around without any proxy whatsoever 
 and who are still completely unaware of the fact that a lot of their oh so 
'confidential' data is secretly siphoned into huge databases, most of them 
located in the States. Thus the results of any research <i>in fieri</i> at the European central 
bank in Frankfurt will probably be known in the States first and in Brussels later.

<bR><br>In fact sofware reverse engineering is such an interesting and powerful science 
(some insiders know that it is in part an "Art") that has been 
now unfortunately - and purposely - pushed into illegality by the commercial bastards and 
their political 
lackeys. Too much power for single individuals, where would we land if 
everyone would be able to understand - and counter - the illegal activities performed by the software they buy 
and install onto their own computers?<br><bR>As a consequence, since I respect even laws that 
are patently illogical and complete nonsense, I have decided to quit the 
"scene" and close my original 
experiment.<bR>
As a conclusion of a five-year long "software reversing" period I must 
state the following: <ul><li>It is in fact possible to <SPAN STYLE="color: black; background: yellow">transform 
crackers into reversers</span>, and it is worth doing it. The evolution of the relevant 
techniques and the spreading of 
tutorials and "teaching" sites - especially during the last two years - proves 
this.</li><lI>Some of the most brilliant people 
I have met on the web are expert reverse engineers, 
and I am honoured to count
among my friends some capable (and some half-mythical) crackers. In fact reverse engineering is the <i> sine qua non </i> for 
fighting back in a world that is getting more and more anti-democratic and oligarchic, where money counts more 
than knowledge (why?) and where  
citizens exist only in order to consume useless gadgets and do and believe 
what they are told to, surely not to think on their own nor to co-decide 
how things should be.</lI>
<lI>It would be very useful to found public "academies of reverse engineering" where 
these talented youngsters (and those who aren't so young, the average age of a reverser is between 25 
and 35) could apply their talents to "legitimate" and useful targets</lI>
<li>Parallel to the trend to 'criminalize' reverse engineering, the triumph of Linux over Windoze 
bears -on the contrary- good omens for the whole software community. It may even be possible, in time, 
to escape the deadly Microsoft's embrace and PROGRESS through "open source" 
software.</li></uL>

Anyway I have slowly -and now definitely- shifted 
the focus of my interest towards web-searching knowledge and 
other not very well known "lores" of the web. <br><bR>
I use the non-existing english plural "lores" with purpose. In fact there is such an overkill of 
"useless" information nowadays, that <u>many</u> real useful "lores" are either 
half-forgotten, or used by a tiny percentage of the people that would 
need it, who pass among themselves 'high level' information on places that 
are difficult to find (and even more difficult to monitor&nbsp;:-)

<bR><br>Despite being a programmer myself, and though 
having used computers since the late 
seventies, I am working "in my real life" as a <font color=blue>linguist</font> (read <i>translator</i>), 
expert for all "informatic related" linguistic fields.<br>Yet my  (long)
university formation was in the field of the early middle ages written sources exegesis: aka  
"<SPAN STYLE="color: black; background: yellow">Quellenforschung</span>". Though not German myself (Gott sei dank :-) I made my 
post-university Doctorate in Germany where I was lucky to have as Mentor  
Frithjof Sielaff,  
one of the 
very few German Quellenforscher "of the old school" able to  
survive the last world war (which destroyed definitely the whole school: 
two wars in fifty years were simply too much...  those 'Quellenforscher' that did not die 
during the first world war, did disappear during the second... so much for german 
Gründlichkeit :-)<br><br>Since being a real linguist and translator  allows me to understand 
quite well - at least passively- more  languages 
that I will ever really need, this asset can also be of some value on a more and more 
international web.<br>Let's cut it short: 
I believe that my software-reverser past, my current real-life activity as "linguist 
expert in informatic and web-related matters" (whatever that 
is supposed to mean :-) and 
 my long (and hard) university and post-university 
formation in "Quellenforschung" do flow together and form a quite relevant 
base for my personal capability as a teacher for searching lores. I may be wrong, of course, 
and your criticisms are therefore more than welcome. <i>Hubris</i> should be 
avoided, by all means, as always.<br><br>What is the web of today? 
"avoid info overloads", "don't loose your track",  "guess names", "feel" the correct 
path of investigation. You would
be surprised how important all these fields are when you are trying to dig 
some nuggets out of the poor-documented history 
of -say- the merowingian nobles :-)<br>
<bR>I'll try to explain why, because I believe it is relevant for our searching purposes. 
<br><br>
Some researchers have been formed, using special tools, methods and approaches, in order to study and teach a very 
specific and "weird" scientific field: "written history sources
of the early middle ages" (600-987). This field  is <u>quite</u> different from analogous 
"more ancient" or 
"more recent" historical font-digging activities: in that specific time-interval people
 used (at least in Europe) pergament, not paper and not clay. Pergament is a "funny" 
media: it is in fact <font color=blue>re-writable</font>! Yup! You can scratch it 
-with a stone-
back to white, deleting (almost completely) 
the previous writings in the process.<bR>Now, since pergament was also expensive, it 
has been used and used again. As a consequence 
very few <u>original</u> documents of the early middle ages have survived... imagine
all those silly monks, that - later - have happily 
re-cycled valuable ancient sources in order to write down for the thousandth time one 
of their boring holy-lives (Acta sanctorum). The original source disappeared and survived 
only through small snippets of citation, hidden references, copycatted snippets 
elsewhere. The quellenforscher of the early years of last century had to re-construct them, 
in an extremely difficult and clever backward approach, reversing the  
snippets that have survived.<br>This happened ONLY in the 
early middle ages. For this reason that period can be considered the 
"black hole" of our past history... for whole centuries 
we know nothing but the NAMES of a couple of kings (but <a href="nomomen.htm">names</a> are -as always- very important <i>per se</i> 
go ahead and study 
the history of Mercia... see? Keorl, Pybba... they sound like Karl and Pippin don't they? And... 
 
:-)<br> Pergament, 
pergament...  a terrible story, isn't it? We have far more data about the previous "clay" times... 
Will probably happen again now, paper times vis-à-vis bytes times, eh.<bR>

See: on one hand almost every friday some "indiana jones" archeologist 
falls into some tomb filled with 
perfectly conserved terracotta writings, on the other hand 
 all historians 
of the late middle ages (the paper, non-pergament, period) are continuously visiting 
 
godforgotten paper-archive in order to write a couple of  
completely useless volumes about -say- "Commerce in Lübeck from 1563 to 1566".<br> 
About the Longobards (on the third and weirdest hand&nbsp;:-) we have only around 50.000 
written words. Once you have gathered and read all of them, you 
know as much as any other can know about that period (given or taken a couple of 
archeological findings). The problem is <ul><lI>
to find <SPAN STYLE="color: black; background: yellow">ALL snippets of 
relevant information</span>, some of them being "lost" or "hidden";</li><lI> then to collate them, checking their validity and <SPAN STYLE="color: black; background: yellow">evaluating 
them</span> behind all "smoke";</lI><li>then to "squeeze" 
such meager information - like a lemon - into 
a <SPAN STYLE="color: black; background: yellow">coherent interpretation</span>;</li>
<lI>then - once more - to check if 
this interpretation is coherent with the "assumed" picture we have (<SPAN STYLE="color: black; background: yellow">questioning</span> 
this "current established picture" again and again - even and specially 
when it looks oh so "obvious").</lI></uL>

<!--  As my Mentor Sielaff more than once stated: if you are sure 
about the info you have gathered, then you <u>are</u> sure. Should your results  
contrast with what everybody else believes, then 
 everybody else must be wrong, you are not. (He knew this <u>very well</u> having been 
anti-nazi during the Reich, 
anti-communist during East Germany and anti-capitalist after the german unification :-)
-->

Samo samo applies 
when searching info on the web IMO.<br>All "Quellenforschung" lores 
and great names like Bresslau, 
Holder-Egger, Waitz and least but not last Hofmeister 
should actually be well known subjects for all web-searchers, since 
the techniques they used are 
<u>very</u> often <u>very</u> useful when perusing and digging this giant 
library without index and with lost 
snippets of information that we call the web.<br><br>
Thus the teachings  about  "finding" rare snippets of information among tons 
of crap have proved quite useful on a web, which - 
as 
you will already have realized - is an Ocean of knowledge... about two 
centimeters deep. <i>De hoc satis</i>: You'll judge by yourself. 

<bR><bR>
There is another reason for my activity: I wanted, and still wish  
to show in the future that you can create - ON YOUR OWN - a non-commercial site that spreads for 
free REAL knowledge. As I have already demonstrated, this kind of "web-snowballs" can 
grow quite a lot.<br>Funny as it may seem, believe me, a lotta people <u>dislike</u> this. Some cannot even understand it, others 
understand it much too much... and hate it even more.<br>"<font color=olive>What? Whattf? This guy is 
sitting on the web since 1995 without even trying to 
make some money out of it? Must be nut! I hate this! Let's destroy this crap or else it risks 
developing into another of these silly anti-commercial web-trends!</font>"<br>Ah! See: this is the best and 
only way, imo, to counter the 
commercialisation of our society... and of the web. Give freely and demonstrate at the same time 
that only giving has any sense at all... <i>Virtute duce, comite fortuna!</i><br>But that is not enough! Retaliate we <u>must</u>: See: "they" take and pocket 
our data, our lives, our 
rights, our hopes, our feelings and our chances just in order to squeeze some money 
out of that. Should we allow it? No! Let's answer back. Let's try to destroy the very 
<u>roots</U> of their 
pathetic "weltanschauung"!<bR><bR>
Ok, ok: I know I have no chance, and I know I'm fighting on the last beach against 
the coming tide. Na Klar. But I'll go down 
with my sword in my hand. <i>Numquam mens exitu aestimanda est</I>: eheh! Besides, I am not alone! 
Take the weapons you want to use - you'll 
find some valuable ones on my site - and join me: we'll lose together - and have some fun 
in the mean time... :-)
