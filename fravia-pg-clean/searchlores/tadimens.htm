The web is huge, of course, but that's not a real problem. The problem is that time 
and space have 
a different meaning on the web. Add to this the truth that everything that 'happens' 
is <u>carved forever</u>: try to pull something 'off the web' and you will soon realize that 
you wont be able 
to do it. Everything you write and publish will defy eternity,  carved in electrons: 
the very moment 
you put something on the web, someone, somewhere, will make a copy out of it. It is 
bound to reappear, somewhere sometime: indestructible and redoutable powers of the 
void.<br><br>
Time is different too. As anyone that has real web-experience knows, it happens that 
something you wrote, or published, remains unanswered - and apparently uncared of - 
for months, or years... and then, 
all of a sudden, when you almost forgot it yourself, a dozen persons begin 
contacting you 
out of the void, with an enormous and for you inexplicable 
interest in what you wrote so long ago. <br>
There are in fact micro-communities, working along similar paths, 
that ignore reciprocally their existence for an inexplicable long time. This has 
of course to do with both the vastness of the web and the fact that people do not 
know how to search.<br> 
Furthermore, the web is <u>truly</U> international, in 
a depth that even those that did travel a lot (mostly) underestimate. Some of the 
readers interacting with you may have problems, ideals and aims so 'alien' from your point 
of view that you cannot even hope to understand them. On the other hand this 
multicultural and 
truly international collaboration may bring some sparkles of fresh breath 
in a world of cloned 
Euro-American zombies who drink the same coke with the same bottles, wear the same shirts, 
the same shoes (and often enough the same pants),   
and sit ritually in the same McDonald's in order 
to perform their compulsory collective and quick "reverse shitting".


<br><br>
The web is truly huge: at the moment there should be around 32 milliard/billions (indexable) 
pages on the "visible" web, according to 
most (self-proclaimed) experts. Less than one half of these documents are indexed by the <a href="main.htm">main</a> search engines.<br> 
<br><center><font color=blue>How many documents there really 
are is anybody's guess.</font></center><br> 
Moreover there's an "invisible" (or "deep") "hidden databases" 
web (made out of  
 dynamic, not persistent, pages, 
the content of which can only be found by a direct query) which could be up to 500 times bigger 
than the "visible" (or "surface") web.
<br>
 Fact is that the <a href="main.htm">main</a> search engines (in this very moment, on 
a continuously moving landscape, Google, Yahoo, MSN, ask, exalead and Gigablast) cover at 
best one third 
of the indexable web, and probably far less. The pace of growth being amazing as well, 
there is no hope  that 
the main search engines will ever be able to cope with the www.<br> 
Hence search engines are not enough (by a long shot not enough) 
in order to search this huge bulk 
of scattered information, 
therefore different methods MUST be used to search the web.
<br><br>But for searchers the huge number of sites and the incredible pace of growth are 
not motives of despair. In fact 
even if the web will continue to increase with the same incredible pace it has registered in the last 
years, its DIAMETER will remain low. Thus searchers will <u>always</u> be able to find what they 
are looking for, provided they know how to search and how to program their own 
<font color=blue>[</font><a href="bots.htm"  target="_blank">bots.htm</a><font color=blue>]</font>  and 
 scrolls.<br><br>
At the moment the diameter of the web should still hover around 19 'clicks'.<br> 
Since the average number of links per page 
is seven (on some sites you'll find hundreds of links, on some others: none), given the
presumed dimensions of the web you should be able to hop from any Internet 
site  to <u>any</u> other one using - on average - just  19 clicks.<br> 
NOTA BENE: This limit will not increase 
much with the growth of the web (there's a logarithmical correlation): it may 
increase to a maximum of 21 or 22 links towards the end of the century.
<br><br>
Therefore (this is the important corollary):   
<SPAN STYLE="color: black; background: yellow">a seeker that knows his skills will always be able to find what he's looking for in 
a relatively short time</span>, no matter how big the web is or will be, this being 
the "<font color=blue>first optimistical law of seeking</font>" :-)


<br> 
This said, the real chances that you can reach at all (I mean, not "on average") 
 - from any random site - 
any random site clicking only forward are just around 25%.
<br><br>
The <SPAN STYLE="color: black; background: yellow">structure</span> of the web, from a searcher's point of view, is - to say 
the least- pretty <u>weird</u>, as you'll see in the picture below.
<br>
Yet the structure of the web  is of paramount 
importance (from a searcher's point of view, eh) in order to decide which techniques 
you should apply when searching <u>and where</u> i.e. in which areas. <br>
Imagine a huge bulk of around 35 milliard (billions) pages, 
all mutually interconnected. This is the  'Nucleus', the very CORE of the web, 
a bulk of strongly or losely interconnetted pages, sites, 
usenet newsgroups, messageboards, you name it.<br>  
This is the 'web' everyone knows, where you 
happily browse from link to link and from blog to advertisement, 
smearing all your personal data along, 
as we try to counter in the '<font color=blue>[</font><a href="noanon.htm" target="_blank">Anonymity</a><font color=blue>]</font>' lore.
It is not easy 
to represent the web threedimensionally. The Nucleus is far from being a compact and uniform 'ball' of  mutually interconnected 
sites, you should think at a 
fractal like entity, with almost 'organic' features, with spaghetti-similar 
'tubes' that quickly 
connect some areas while leaving 'link-holes' in many places, in fact it would probably 
look like a chump of Gruyere (the commercial advertisement banners being the cause of its 
bad smell&nbsp;:-)

<!-- how to search the web, by fravia+, signet end -->
As you can see there are four main different areas:  'bulk',  'hidden databases',  'outside linkers' 
and  'outside linked'.<br>
Different techniques are used to access these different areas.<br><br>

An important area of the web is made of 
<SPAN STYLE="color: black; 
background: yellow">hidden databases</span>. These are pages that the Nucleus points to, and that may 
(or may not) point back to the Nucleus. Yet 
for commercial (or other access-restrictive) reasons  visitors of sites located here 
are supposed to 
"pay" or adhere to some political, religious or social "clan" 
in order to access them. As you may imagine, these pages 
are NOT mutually linked.<br>Fortunately (for us... unfortunately for the commercial bastards)
the web was originally built 
in order to <u>share</u> (neither to <u>hoard</u> nor to <u>sell</u>) knowledge. 
And thus the building blocks, the 
"basic frames" behind the 
structure of the web are still the same of the web of old: <font color=blue>a tool
made to freely and gratuitously exchange information</fonT>.<br>If I may dare a comparison: exactly as it is 
pretty easy 
to break any software protection written in a higher language if you know 
(and use) assembly, 
so it is easy to break any server delivered 'barrier' to a given 
database if you know (and can outflank) the protocols used by 
browsers and servers.<br>
As a result let's simply say that it is 
relatively easy to access 99% of the pages you may encounter reversing the (simple) perl 
or javascript tricks used to keep  "off limit"  zombies and lusers. (You wont 
even have to recurr to common exploits &#224 la 
"<a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=30&hl=en&q=%2Bborland+%2B%22politically+correct%22+%2Binprise&btnG=Google+Search" target="_blank">politically correct</a>"&nbsp;:-)

<br><br>
The Nucleus "points" to another area of the web, the "<SPAN STYLE="color: black; 
background: yellow">outside linked</span>". The sites in this area 
are linked from the Nucleus but do not point back to it. A simple example: the elements of 
a  
database of images, linked from the Nucleus but not necessarily pointing back to it. 
This part of the web, made mostly out of 'storage clumps' and 
"non hidden" databases (but not only), 
can be searched 
and <a href="combress.htm" target="_blank">combed</a> with the same searching techniques that we usually  
apply when searching the Nucleus. These pages are "outside" the nucleus, yet not 
particularly difficult to find.
<br><br>
 Like matter and anti-matter, to the "outside linked" pages we spoke of above, correspond 
an inversed related part of the web:  the "<SPAN STYLE="color: black; 
background: yellow">outside linkers</span>" pages. Indeed 
all the pages located in this specific  area 
of the web do "point" to the Nucleus but are not pointed back from it. Imagine -as
 an example- the personal links page of a scientist: lotta interesting links to 
the Nucleus yet no need to publicize its existence. A page with information you 
may need is there, somewhere, without any 
link whatsoever that could bring you to it. Indeed there are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonomasia">per antonomasia</a> 
no links back from 
the Nucleus to these "outside linkers".<br>     Since no link whatsoever points back to them, 
the "outside linkers" are a part of the web you cannot reach using 
"normal" search techniques. Yet these places may hoard 
knowledge you need. There are, fortunately, some techniques that you can apply in order 
 to find them, the most simple and common one being 'klebing' (using referrers and luring/stalking 
techniques on top of it).
<br>Anyway, first of all learn the <a href="basic.htm">the basic</a>!<br><br>
<a name="always"></a><br>
<center>   
<table border=1 width=88%><tr><td bgcolor="#C6E7C6"><center><font
size=+3>You'll always find what you want</font></center></td></tr></table></center>
<br><br>
And even when all your searching techniques have failed, 
when all your cunning approaches did not 
catch anything, your lonely searches seems endless, when all your tricks have brought
 you no reward... 
even when a rude database dares deny you access, 
even when your target has been pulled off the web, jailed, destroyed, censored, annichilated 
by the powers that be... even in those 
dire moments you will always know that <SPAN STYLE="color: black; 
background: yellow">you can find what you are looking for even if it is no more there</span>!<br>
Yes, as strange as it may seem to you, this is the
 "<font color=blue>second optimistical law of seeking</font>" :-)<br>
 How do you find your disappeared target? You travel trough time.<br>
 How do you travel trough time? You take advantage ofthe fact that EVERYTHING THAT HAS 
 BEEN PUT ON THE WEB ONCE WILL LIVE ON COPYCATTED ELECTRONS FOR THE ETERNITY, either trough 
 the usual & well-known public '<font color=blue>[</font><a href="fu_speci.htm#disapp" target="_blank">time machines</a><font color=blue>]</font>' (basically huge 
 caches or 'photosnaps' of the web at a given time), 
 or through more 'gray' (and difficult) channels and <a href="http://www.searchlores.org/c_first.htm" target="_blank">alleys</a> 
 that you'll discover and take advantage of in due time. <br>
 Anyway be assured: you are going to be a seeker, you will be able to 
  find everything, even targets that do not exist any more.

<br>Given that everything you put on the web will live forever on copycatted  electrons,
 we can derivate a third law...<br><br>

Plagiarist
is someone that 'appropriates' 

informations or thoughts or data he finds on the web without giving 
due reference to the original Author of the data / thoughts / information he is using, trying to 
'give the impression' he is the real Authors of such data / thoughts / information.<br>
Unfortunately (for the Plagiarist) on the web it is as easy to plagiate as it is to find out 
the plagiarism, using  <a href="synecdoc.htm" target="_blank">ad hoc searching techniques</a>.
<br><br>
In fact the web is incredibly 'stiky': try searching for the first line of this very page:<br>

You will most probably (on the slippery web you may always 'slip'&nbsp;:-) 
<a href="http://google.yahoo.com/bin/query?p=%22Knowing+how+to+find+anything+you+want+on+the+web%2c+once+you+will+have+learned+it%2c+will+give+you+power.%22&w=dir&fr=op&o=a&h&g=0&n=20&hc=0&hs=0" target="_blank">land</a>

<br>
This is the reason those that <u>create</u> content should never fear to give it out for 
free! A correct 'restitution' of the paternity of any given snippet is possible using 
ad hoc searching techniques (like the ones regarding the '<a href="fu_speci.htm#disapp" target="_blank">disappeared web</a>' 
we have pointed to in the previous chapter).
<br>
This is the reason we don't need to fear being plagiarized by
self described 'Super searcher experts', 'internationally respected Internet 
trainers' and/or 'Revered Authorities
on Web search engines' nor any 
other of the commercial hot baloons that abound on the web (And that you should 
learn to <a href="evaluate.htm" target="_blank">evaluate</a> (or rather 'devaluate'&nbsp;:-) 
 on your own: they will NEVER be 
as able as we are in providing NEW content. It would take them a whole life of (heavy) 
studies just to reach those levels we have already abandoned. Besides I firmly believe that 
the very moment you cease to do something for fun, joy or interest and you begin doing it 
for 'money', your value decreases...&nbsp;:-)
<br>
The above explains also - incidentally - the reason you may (and should) want to 
contribute to THIS site: 
your work will never be plagiarized without being discovered (and eventually 
triggering a well-deserved <a href="ideale.htm">punishment</a>&nbsp;:-)
<br>This is still the realm of the web of old, and no trespassers are allowed from 
the commercial sargassos seas.<br>
Your contributions may be used by others, they may be teached, learned, shared, 
developed or built upon, but they will 
always remain YOURS, we'll together take care of that&nbsp;:-)
<br>Thus  the
 "<font color=blue>third optimistical law of seeking</font>" reads: '<SPAN STYLE="color: black;

 EVERYTHING - and at the same time 
 NOTHING - can be plagiated</span>'&nbsp;:-)

<font size=+1>
<br>Knowing how to find anything you want on the web, once you will have learned it, 
will give you power. As always, that power can be used for 'evil' deeds and/or for 
'good' deeds (let's leave aside, for now, the rather complex question of what would be 'evil' and 
what  'good', just use your own parameters).
<br>A similar problem arised in my previous  'page of reverse engineering'  (1995-2000), 
a site that dealt specifically 
with software reverse engineering techniques and tools. The idea was to convert young 
crackers (i.e. people 
interested almost only in breaking software protections) into software reverse 
engineers, something 
that the <font color=blue>[</font><a href="http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/news/0,4586,2636304,00.html" target="_blank">world needs 
badly</a><font color=blue>]</font>, especially given the many  <font color=blue>[</font><a href="malware.htm" target="_blank">malwares</a><font color=blue>]</font> practices around.<br>
The experiment worked only in part, hence the decision a couple of years ago  to freeze that site<br>
<br>
Spreading knowledge on the web is indeed a difficult act of balance.<br> 
There is for instance a special section, ported from the previous site,  
called 'ideale.htm', that was indeed intended as a sort of small 
'introduction' to various "lores of destruction" (yet 
purposedly not server-attack oriented). 
 There are indeed enough informations (and 'angles') there  to allow anyone 
 with average searching skills to find out, on other parts of the web, 
 everything he may need to wreak havoc on a server and then some. 
<br>
Not that anyone would really need help for that: a simple search like  <font color=blue>[</font><a href="http://www.wisenut.com//search/query.dll?allk=%2Bdirectory+%2Bindexing+%2Bbugtraq&notk=&phrasek=" target="_blank">+directory +indexing +bugtraq</a><font color=blue>]</font> will "turn some mighty big stones", as 
a contributor pointed out some time ago.
<br><br>
This raises an interesting paradox.<br> 
Basically it is now clear that those that do learn how to search, which is what this  
site is intended to teach, will be able to find on the web -if needs be- ANY KNOWLEDGE, 
and thus anyone of 
the million possible exploits, some of them '<font color=blue>so recent that 
your server administrator wont even understand what's going on</font>'.<br>
Thus, once learned how to search they COULD turn out to be 
potential dangerous little script kiddies.
<br>
Yet -at the same time-  there are reasons to believe (and hope)  
they won't be 'simple' script kiddies anymore once they realize what incredible 
power the sheer fact of being capable to search gives them.
<br>
No kidding: we came to the conclusion -for me <u>quite unexpected</u> 
until a couple of years ago- that a good seeker can be <font color=blue>MUCH MORE 
DANGEROUS</font> than a good cracker or a good hacker or a good viri writer 
or a good reverser, because HE CAN BE ALL OF THEM AT ONCE, 
lacking their in-depth understanding of their relative specific field, 
but easily compensating this with his evaluation and searching skills.<br>
That's one of the reasons of our insisting (through the <font color=blue>[</font><a href="realicra/realicra.htm" target="_blank">reality 
 cracking</a><font color=blue>]</font> section and various ramblings) 
 on the ETHICAL side of the coin: may the "dangerous" seekers we contribute to  
 create endanger the enemies of poetry, knowledge, 
 diversity and tolerance and annoy instead the apostles of compelled behaviour,
  consumistic slavery, 
 monolithical thinking and religious fanaticism (be it under the forms of catholic, jewish or islamic 
 intolerance).<br>
This said, I do believe also that seekers are and will be 
open-minded <u>per definition</u>, and thus pretty difficult to force 
into any pre-definite, pre-digested or 'obligatorial' way of thought. 
<br>Therefore ethic should kiss their shoulders 'semi-authomatically' 
when they seek.<br> <SPAN STYLE="color: black; 
background: yellow">Seekers will grow ethically for the simple fact they seek</span>, 
this evolution into an 
ethical seeker being 
the "<font color=blue>fourth optimistical law of seeking</font>"&nbsp;:-)
<br>In fact, judging from the firewalls' loggings, most attacks seem to come 
from idiots that DO NOT KNOW how to search... hence they are using common 
exploits and can easily be stopped (and if necessary directly and immediately punished&nbsp;:-)
<br>
<br>Anyway, first of all, learn how to seek!

This introduction is getting far too far... go back to the 
<font color=blue>[</font><a href="index.html">entrance</a><font color=blue>]</font>  and click on the 
main logo... your long trip into the lore of searching is about to begin.
<br><hr width=44%>
As you'll discover perusing my site, there 
are many more sections. For security reasons  
some of them  like the  <font color=blue>[</font><a href="http://fravia.2113.ch/phplab/phplab.htm" target="_blank">PHP Lab</a><font color=blue>]</font> are located  
on a different 
server while some other will become accessible only 
once you yourself will 
have gathered enough searching - and hopefully <font color=blue>[</font><a href="tadimens.htm#ethic">ethical</a><font color=blue>]</font>  skills. 
<br>Yes, there are indeed many pages on this site... you are not 
compelled to follow any logical path. You may peruse everything at 
will, you are welcome. Do not be scared, nor paralysed if you don't 
understand everything immediately, knowledge is like one of the chill 
white wines 
bottled in the ancient lagoons I come from: you should sip it slowly 
and knowingly, else it won't do you no good.
