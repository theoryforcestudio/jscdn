This essay by Finn61 is extremely important for those seekers that never realized 
the mighty power of a well-thought combing approach when searching signals among the noise.<br>
See: loggings do not have (yet) commercial bias nor do they suffer 
"politically correct" censorship attempts. Hence the richness, the beauty and the beaconing 
power of these tiny "lighttowers" that will pinpoint the route to your well deserved tresaures 
when navigating among the dark commercial sargassoes of today's web...<br>
Try each and every link given in the essay, and gasp in awe...

<H1>Proxy Logs - The Other White Meat</H1>
<P><I>"Like I said earlier. There are logs all over the internet." - 
Unknown</I></P></CENTER>
<P>The log files of a proxy server are interesting to look at because 
rather 
than a normal webserver, which would log access to pages on that server 
the 
proxy server also logs access to locations all over the net.</P>
<P>Where ever the users go, you can go there too. Outside linkers? 
Hidden files? 
You may find them here.</P>
<P>So how do you find a proxy server that publishes it's logs on the 
web? Search 
engine of course, but using careful search terms to pluck out our 
logs.</P>
<P><B>Case 1 - PWEBSTATS</B></P>
<P><A href="http://martin.gleeson.com/pwebstats/">Pwebstats</A> is a 
pearl 
script that analyses server logs and produces stats and graphs.</P>
<P>By default, all the HTML pages that pwebstats produces include a 
footnote 
saying "These statistics produced by pwebstats".</P>
<P>You could do a search for this in Google if you want to see what kind 
of 
output this thing produces.</P><A 
href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;q=%22=these+statistics+produced+by+pwebstats%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search">"These 
statistics produced by pwebstats"</A>
<P></P>
<P>To narrow it down, there is one particular page that is the most 
interesting 
to us. That is the requests list.</P>
<P>Once again there is another default setting we can utilise. The page 
displaying the requests uses the following format :</P>
<P>/servername.n.total-accesses.html</P>
<P>servername 3D the name of the server (strangely enough)<BR>n 3D an 
incremental 
number</P>
<P>So now we can search for :</P>
<P><A 
href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;q=allinurl%3A%22total-accesses.html%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search">allinurl:"total-accesses.html"</A></P>
<P>But this gives us other servers as well as proxies. Narrow it down 
some more 
with :</P><A href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;q=allinurl%3A%22total-accesses.html%22+proxy&amp;btnG=Google+Search">allinurl:"total-accesses.html" 
proxy</A>
<P></P>
<P>This gets any that have the word proxy in the url.</P>
<P>If you are looking for forbidden fruit you may find it doesn't hang 
around 
for very long in a particular location. That's why it's sometimes 
important to 
find the latest version of the logs. You may not have any luck if you 
are 
looking at a log from 1998.</P>
<P>Try changing the incremental number in the URL. The highest number is 
usually 
the latest log.</P>
<P>OK, now here's a nice one in Taiwan that you may find contains quite 
a few 
interesting links :</P>
<P><A 
href="http://proxy2.ncku.edu.tw/usage/days/requests/proxy2.360.total-accesses.html">http://proxy2.ncku.edu.tw/usage/days/requests/proxy2.360.total-accesses.html</A></P>
<P>..and if you would like to find out exactly what day the incremental 
numbers 
correspond to go here :</P><A 
href="http://proxy2.ncku.edu.tw/usage/g-index.html">http://proxy2.ncku.edu.tw/usage/g-index.html</A>
<P></P>
<P><B>Case 2 - WEBALIZER</B></P>
<P>You didn't think pwebstats was the only utility for analysing log 
files did 
you?</P>
<P>Same deal, different software. This time we look for the footnote 
"generated 
by webalizer".</P>
<P>This search will give you some pretty stats to look at :</P>
<P><A 
href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=inurl%3Aproxy+%22Generated+by+Webalizer%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search">inurl:proxy "generated by webalizer"</A></P>
<P>Like before I've added the word "proxy" into the search to weed out 
any 
boring servers.</P>
<P>Now if you look at one of these pages you may get the summary like 
this one 
:</P>
<P><A 
href="http://proxy.intechworld.net/webalizer/usage_200203.html">http://proxy.intechworld.net/webalizer/usage_200203.html</A></P>
<P>You'll notice you only get the top 100 URL's. When the total is 
102348 you 
can be sure the top 100 are very common and very well known sites. If 
you're 
looking for that hidden jewel it is probably somewhere a little more 
secretive! 
:)</P>
<P>You can click on "View All URLs" to get them all. You may not want to 
do that 
with the above example because the page will be quite massive! Try this 
one 
instead :</P>
<P><A 
href="http://www.pals.msus.edu/webstats/proxy/UCR/url_200108.html">http://www.pals.msus.edu/webstats/proxy/UCR/url_200108.html</A></P>
<P>I've noticed not all of the tables have the "View All URLs" link. I 
presume 
it depends on the config.</P>
<P>So now you should have some large lists of URL's you can scan for 
that 
hard-to-find document or program. Try amassing a few pages and searching 
through 
them all with a text scanner. You might find that hidden link.</P>
<P>There's more log's out there. There's more log analysers too. Each 
with their 
own distinguishable defaults. Have a look for them.<br>
Send back your findings, let's all build on the shoulders of each other!</P>
<P>Ciao,</P>

<font color=blue>DQ's addition (March 2002, probably true 
for all other services &#224; la webalizer as well):</font></i>
<pre>
Finn61, very nice essay!! 

A short addition: Webalizer stores its findings 
by default in a raw file in the same subdirectory 
as the generated html files. This raw file is named 
webalizer.current. 

Using your examples, we (and not google ;-) 
are able to fish this file and extract whatever 
additional info is held back from our prying eyes.

HTH,

An interesting websearchstring?<br>
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=%22webalizer.current%22&num=10&hl=en&ie=ISO-8859-1&oe=ISO-8859-1&btnG=Google+Search&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&lr=&as_ft=i&as_filetype=&as_qdr=all&as_occt=any&as_dt=i&as_sitesearch=&safe=off" target="_blank">"webalizer.current"</a>
<br>
there are MANY more, like weblog, calamaris, http-analyze, squii, pagestats, summary and last but not least loganalyzer (http://www.123loganalyzer.com/)</font>
