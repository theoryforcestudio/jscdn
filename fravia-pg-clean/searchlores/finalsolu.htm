<br><br> <font color=blue size=+2>Introduction</font>  
<br><br>
<b>The four images published at <a href="http://www.searchlore.org">searchlore.org</a> in december 2004 were
 part of a workshop that I made, together with my friend Bidwell, in a french university a coupla months ago.</b>
<br><br> (Images finding on the web as art and passion ~ Advertisement debunking)<br><hr width=44%><br></center>
Can you find/guess/infere the images below?  What they represent, what they  mean? <br>As Bidwell pointed out to me, there 
are enough data IN THE IMAGES THEMSELVES to allow seekers (and advertisement debunkers)  to solve the 
assignment, i. e. finding what these images represent and mean, <i>even without 
finding the images themselves</i>, which is probably true, comet 
to think of it, though 
such statements are always easy... once you have gained 
knowledge 
<i>ex 
post</i>.<br><br>
In fact the FIRST image (<a href="source2.htm">The chick on the river</a>) has been presented, both in the workshop and in the web,
 WITHOUT pointing out that it is an advertisement. Participants would 
have had to find that out by themselves. And then would have had to find out what KIND of advertisement it represented, 
and then to find it out on the 
web and to find out WHAT SPECIFIC advertisement it was.
<br><br>
And all participants did it relatively quickly, both during the university workshop with some help by Bidwell and me
 and on the web, where the seekers' community at large found out the images with an astonishing velocity and ease.
<br><br>

The declared purpose of such images debunking exercises is to test viewers' ability to "debunk" images, 
which is in itself a useful skill in our "images bombarded" society. 
<br><br>So now it is up  to you... what kind of (different) messages do the four images contain? 
Why should somebody have published them,  
 what do they represent, which 'levers' are they supposed to move, in the subconscious of the viewer, and why? 
 <br>Answering 
these questions  makes it easy to understand where the images may come from. And what they should mean, and what probably they were
 used for...
<br><br>
The images are all ORIGINAL and have NOT been edited nor modified, nor alterated in any way... just  scaled and cropped by me, 
and not too much. <br><br>
Finally it must be cleared that partipants were AWARE that the three other images    apart from the initial  
<a href="source2.htm">The chick on the river</a>:  
          &nbsp;&nbsp; 1) <a href="carocolo.htm">What do we sell?</a>      &nbsp;&nbsp;  
          2)  <a href="revenge.htm">The head of the crab</a> &nbsp;&nbsp; 
          and 3) 
           <a href="quietharbour.htm">The quiet harbour</a> 
          were advertisement. And unfortunately this made finding them very easy for seekers used to enter quickly ANY database 
          of the web, no matter how well (or as in this case stupidily) protected, and also able to peruse any on line database 
          efficiently
          with powerful searchstrings. So, when they found one of the three advertisement, they found all three of them in a wiff.

    <br>
    For "The chick on the river" please check the <a href="source2.htm">ad hoc page</a>. Reading the discussions  there 
    you'll gain a lot of angles for your own image debunking activities.
    <br><br><br>
    For  the "What do we sell?"...
    <br>
    The title "What do we sell?" itself points to the fact that the little BMW logo is clearly (and this evidence 
    notwithstanding <u>also</u> subliminally at the same time) quite visible 
    in the small "tyre formed" ring in the left of the lake.  Note that here, a car brand advertisement, we have no cars and no roads 
    at all in the image...
    <br>
    While there's NO OTHER connection to a car (quite the contrary, uncontaminated nature, as often with car advertisements, that 
    will never show you a car in its usual habitat: the middle of stinky traffic congestions) the portuguese words (that require 
    some zooming and some tools to read) point to 
    Brasil and it's only a matter of time   until the reader discover a repository of portuguese bmw advertisement.
    <br><br> <br>
    For  "The head of the crab"...
    <br>
    Either, as many lazy ones have done, you just peruse the same database until you find it, or you notice, as many did, that the crab 
    has quite NASTY  intentions, and is coming out of the pan in order to haunt you (as the title "revenge") also implies.
    <br>
    So that's a 'alka seltzer' advertisement for those that have eaten too much the evening before, as also the small circle on the 
    right side below (the top of a tablett) points to.
    <br><br><br>
    And now you have enough hints to find by yourself the third  -and most difficult- one, "The quiet harbour", which has an amazing
     nasty /filthy "double sense" 
    inside its meaning and purpose, that can also be derived observing the slighly "unnatural" position of the model :-) <br><br>
    Yet it is a real advertisement, that was really  published... and I bet that many people (of both sexes !), having seen 
    it streets and magazines have been 
    deceived "hook and senker" by the hidden messages of those nasty perverts that only want to make bucks over our dead 
    pavlovian reflections...&nbsp;:-(    <br><br>
    I already said too much... enough. C'mon, if I gave you the correct solutions for everything, and if I woudl not leave 
    at least a small bait, your
     seaching learning curve would be steeper, dear reader...&nbsp;:-)
