<STRONG>Note</STRONG>: This function was originally made available for Internet
    users who have email but no ftp access. It has become an alternative to ftp. There
	is a catch (there is no such thing as free lunch :-): it is not an efficient use
	of bandwidth because the size of the uuencoded file is larger than the original
	file, more data is carried across the network. Because of this, some postmasters
	frown upon users who abuse this facility.

<B><U>1. Some Basics</U></B>
<BR><BR>
<B>&nbsp;<U>a. Getting started</U></B>
<p><em>ftpmail</em> is a widely available package, which allows
the user to submit FTP requests by email. <br>
The receiving service interprets the commands and invokes an FTP
service in the normal way (usually, but not necessarily on the
same machine). The normal output from the FTP service is emailed
back to the user. <br>
A number of additional commands are also available to control the
<em>ftpmail</em> server itself. These allow the user to choose
options relating to the encoding or compression of data files and
the splitting of data files into manageable sized sections. <br>
A full log of the server's activities is produced. Requests are
queued and there is the capability to cancel jobs. </p>

<HR WIDTH=15%>

<BR>
There is no standard usage so first email the server with the word
'help' in the body of the message and instructions will be sent to you.
Don't put a signature block on the end of your message.
<P>
Follow the instructions when making a request.
<P>
Files as received are normally split into segments which are <STRONG>uuencoded</STRONG>.
You need a decoder to decode the files. To uudecode the whole file either:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>rename the segments giving them files names with consecutive
numbers (e.g. <CODE>f1.uue</CODE> <CODE>f2.uue</CODE> ...) and point <STRONG>uudecode</STRONG>
to the first file in the sequence; or
<P>
<LI>concatenate the segments in their correct order, strip out the two
introductory lines in all but the first segment, and uudecode the whole file.
</UL>

<HR WIDTH=15%>
<BR>
<B>&nbsp;<U>b. How does the ftp-by-email work </U></B>
<BR>
You send a regular mail to a ftpmail host (see below) and in the body
of the message you put ftp'ish commands, eg:

<LISTING>
help
</LISTING>

	or

<LISTING>
connect x2ftp.oulu.fi
chdir /pub/msdos/programming/gpe
dir
binary
uuencoded
get pcgpe10.zip
quit
</LISTING>

And then the ftpmailer logs on to the ftp-site and performs the above  
commands and mails the result back to you.

<B>&nbsp;<U>d. UUencoding</U></B>
<BR>
Binary file transfers using ftpmail aren't difficult ... they just require a
few additional steps. Because all e-mail has to be in ASCII form, ftpmail has to
encode your Binary file in ASCII before it can e-mail the file to you. Once you
get the file, you can then decode the file back into Binary :) 

Fortunately, there are two ways that ftpmail can encode Binary files into ASCII.
The first way it can do this is through something called "uuencode." As long as
you have a uudecode program -- and uudecode programs are all over the place (chances
are your site has uudecode stored on its system) -- the whole process is simple. 

<BR><BR>
<FONT COLOR="green">Some encoders : </FONT>
<BR>1. WinZip 
<BR>2. uudecode.com - 1821 bytes 
<BR>3. WinCode -- look at SoftSeek 
<BR>4. got some javascript-program <I>somewhere</I> at my HD - gonna publish it
