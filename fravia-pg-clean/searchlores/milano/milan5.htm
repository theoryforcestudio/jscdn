<font size=+2 color=blue>The importance of subsidiarity and 
'micro-searching' for seekers</font><br><font size=+1>

Webrings, homepages clusters, maillists, messageboards, national engines, usenet
<br>
So-called "local" search engines are extremely 
important to fetch info. Freepages providers, counters, 
stats applications and all other finalized search engines... 
that you can use at leisure... 
for fun, searching purposes, combing 
and/or knowledge profit.
<br><br>
There's noway I can give you in the short time of my slot a complete description of 
the huge plethora of tools available.

<br><br>
<font size=+2 color=blue>Usenet</font><br><font size=+1>
Among the different 'local' areas of the web, 
usenet is without any doubt extremely important for searchers, 
and Dejanews (one of the few remaining usenet repositories)
 has proved 
to be an unconturnable service for seekers.<br>
To peruse usenet, you must access a news server, which 
is nothing else than a computer system which provides shared 
storage for Usenet articles. Usenet must use "shared storage" 
because its total volume is HUGE. Instead of requiring each reader 
to obtain and store 200,000 articles in 2 GBytes per day, the 
articles can be kept in a central location and thus can 
be "shared" by many readers.<br>
Be aware of some typical usenet "quirks": 
Each server has ONLY A PART of the total articles. 
Your news reader can only display articles which are present 
on the news server you access. If an article is not present 
on the server, it is because either that article has never arrived 
at your server, or it has been cancelled, 
or else it has expired.<br>
Because there is a limited amount of storage on a local news server, 
articles "must" expire. But fortunately, the accumulated body of information 
of Usenet is not lost: There are a number of WWW sites which archive and 
index Usenet articles. Thus you can retrieve posts which have expired 
(or perhaps had not even arrived) at your local news server.
<br>
Instead of asking a question in a news group, you can use the Usenet 
archives to retrieve articles which discussed your question long ago.
By searching first and posting questions only if you find no answers, 
everyone will be much happier (this is valid for messageboards as 
well, btw :-)<bR>
Searching usenet first you will get an answer faster. You don't have to 
wait for your message to reach the far corners of the world. 
You don't have to rely on someone nice enough to write a reply. 
Perhaps those in the know aren't listening right now, even if 
they answered the same question in depth in the past.
Searching offers an added advantage: you will also find the groups 
which have an interest in your topic. Do not underestimate it. So 
if you cannot find the answer in the archived messages, you will 
have a good starting place to ask questions.<br>
A final word of WARNING: there are a series of anonymity 
concerns that you should consider when posting on usenet. 
You may consider visiting sites with a section 
giving advices about <a href="https://searchlores.nickifaulk.com/milano/noanon.htm">anonymity</a>, like mine :-)

<font size=+2 color=blue>An example of querystring reversing</font><br><font size=+1>
<bR>Let's have a close look at a Dejavue Searchstring<br>
<br>(discovering some interesting Deja-tricks)<bR> </center>
Usually you would search deja using a string like the following one:<bR>
</FONT></font></fonT>
<a href="http://www.deja.com/qs.xp?OP=dnquery.xp&ST=MS&DBS=2&QRY=%22how+to+search%22">http://www.deja.com/qs.xp?OP=dnquery.xp&ST=MS&DBS=2&QRY=%22how+to+search%22</a><br>
<br><font size=+1>
Yet the above search string gives you all spammers in extenso 
 and a lot of side-banners and other commercial crap. Therefore it would be a good idea 
to use 
<font color=blue>the following one instead</font> to avoid some of the advertisements, 
adding <SPAN STYLE="color: black; background: yellow">=dnc</span> after the main part of the url:<br>

</fonT>
<a href="http://www.deja.com/=dnc/qs.xp?OP=dnquery.xp&ST=MS&DBS=2&QRY=%22how+to+search%22">http://www.deja.com/=dnc/qs.xp?OP=dnquery.xp&ST=MS&DBS=2&QRY=%22how+to+search%22</a><br>
<br><font size=+1>
Ahah! Resultspage looks a little better now, doesnt it? :-) 
but there is another interesting option: you can also have the same results 
<SPAN STYLE="color: black; background: yellow">threaded</span> if you add at 
the end of the string <SPAN STYLE="color: black; background: yellow">&threaded=1</span><br>
</fonT>
<a href="http://www.deja.com/=dnc/qs.xp?OP=dnquery.xp&ST=MS&DBS=2&QRY=%22how+to+search%22&threaded=1">http://www.deja.com/=dnc/qs.xp?OP=dnquery.xp&ST=MS&DBS=2&QRY=%22how+to+search%22&threaded=1</a><br>
<bR><font size=+1>Nice, isn't it?   <hr width=44% align=left>
Note that similar effects can be obtained - on deja - playing with the deja-related 
"infoseek" string:<br>
</font>
<a href="http://www.deja.com/=infoseek/dnquery.xp?DBS=2&QRY=%22how+to+search%22&svcclass=dncurrent">http://www.deja.com/=infoseek/dnquery.xp?DBS=2&QRY=%22how+to+search%22&svcclass=dncurrent</a>

<font size=+2 color=blue>Local search engines</font><font size=+1>
<br><bR>
Microsearching (local searching) means taking advantage of a plethora of tools that 
the web offers, from the specific search engines that most homepages clusters have, to 
the webrings search engines, the maillists search engines and the 'local' search engines like 
AOL and hitbox. Public 'free' counters are for instance a very useful resources when searching 
specific material, especially if they are categorized by the users themselves, like hitbox. 
Micro/local searching is very valuable in many fields: try your own "hobbyes" 
searches on any personal homepage cluster � la Geocities or xoom (or fortunecity, or thousand other 
"free" page providers), compare with the results you would get through the main search engines 
 and 
you'll immediately understand what I mean.
<br><hr>
<font size=+2 color=blue>Regional search engines</font><font size=+1>
<br><bR>
Regional search engines are even more important in a more and more international web.
Take note that among the future www developments <font color=blue>cross language information 
retrieval</fonT>, or CLIR (which 'grossomodo' means querying in one language 
documents in many languages and implies a lot of semanthic algos) will 
become more and more important.<br><br>
The searching value of "Subsidiarity" (a term which <i>per se</i> is 
nothing else than a synonym for 
feudalisation in the European Union's jargon) is <u>extremely</u> high. 
So-called "regional" search engines are incredibly important for fetching 'less biased'
info. As you may expect, russian, chinese, indian, japanese and 'you-name-them' collections of datas 
have a completely different 'cut' vis-�-vis the stuff you can find 
in the euroamerican world. (This is of course true for all sort of data: 
files, images, sounds, films, software...
the well-known motto being "<font color=blue>always go ftp-fishing far from the copyright-obsessed 
euroamericans</fonT>).<br>Anyway there are huge differences (in quality, 'cut' and bias) 
between 'european' and 'american'  
data colections as well.<br>
<bR>The value of critical information is increasing, 
and such information is now - for the first time in the history of 
our race - available for everybody (once he knows how to search: unfortunately
the volume of commercial rubbish you'll have to wade through is 
increasing exponentially).
<br>
<br>The web is an Ocean of knowledge... 
about two centimeters deep. 
Finding rare snippets of information among tons of crap is getting more and more difficoult
 because on a more and more 'commercial' web you are compelled to wade through 
<u>a lot</u> of noise to get to the signal.<br>Most search engines 
DO NOT index the most interesting parts 
of the web: they index commercial over educational sites, 
'popular' sites (read sites loved by the zombies) over relatively 
unknown sites and US sites over European sites... Well you should at least try to 
compensate  this last disadvantage using search engines located outside the States.
<br><br>
Do not underestimate the task of a seeker, though: 
even mastering the 'subsidiariety searching' lore, 
and knowing some elementary 
microsearching techniques 
is not enough to be a good seeker: in order to
search effectively you <u>must</u> also know some more 'broad'  
'reversing techniques', else you'll never be able to build your 
own bots.<hr width=44%>
