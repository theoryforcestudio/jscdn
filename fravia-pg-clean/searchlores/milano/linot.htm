<font size=+2 color=blue>A windozian reverser @ the Linuxday</font><br><font size=+1>
<hr><br>Please be patient: my english is not the best around. I even wondered if I 
should have held this workshop in Italian, that according to some friends I speak slightly 
better than english&nbsp;:-(<br>I'll decide on the spot, in Milan, after having seen 
the visages of the people listening to me.<br><br>Ok, let's begin.<br>
First of all: I'm not a real Linux buff. I was *nix oriented eons ago, but 
I have reversed windows software for so many years, now,  
that I am much more familiar with windozes 'guts' than with Linux reversing. 
Web-teachers of mine 
told me a long time ago that we must spread knowledge where the fishes are, and as a 
matter of fact, like it or not, until recently the zombified masses of PC users 
of this planet seemed to love windows and dislike Linux.<br>
Fortunately this is changing more and more: a lotta 
zombies are now springing onto the Linux bandwagon as well. Equity approaches.<br><br>
Windows comes now in so many flavours (95, 98, NT, ME, 2000poor, 2000rich) that 
even idiots get scared. Drivers problems in windoze are nowaday even worse than 
those encountered among the different distributions of Linux.<br><br>

Anyway the operating system you use is relatively irrelevant when searching the web.<br> 
Admittedly Linux offers a more stabile platform and better control possibilities 
about <a href="http://www.searchlores.org/malware.htm">malwares</a> (software that spyes your habits, a very widespread pest in 
windows), and you should use Linux - by all means -  
but some powerful reversing and searching tools are windoze's oriented (to say the 
least), and ignoring this when mining data would be a <u>serious</u> mistake.<br><br>
To-day I'm going to chat with you about some 'websearching techniques' that 
can help you to find what you are looking for, and that will allow you 
to find - also - what you are not (yet)
looking for.<br><br>I also want to underline the <font color=blue>cosmic power</fonT> that 
software reverse engineering can give you. Therefore I will close this workshop demonstrating 
a simple technique to get rid 
of advertisement banners planted inside software (using webferret as an example). Since 
this approach does not require any particular software reversing skill, and can thus be applied 
by anyone with eggplant level brain, it 
should put a nice stop to a pestering habit (and billion dollars industry) that 
utterly annoys me.<br><br><center>
But first of all you must understand the dimension of the problem that web-searchers have to face:
