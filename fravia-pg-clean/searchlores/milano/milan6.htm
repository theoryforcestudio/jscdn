<font size=+2 color=blue>Free source! We'll find it by ourself if needs be</font><br><font size=+1>
<br>This is a somehow 'difficult' part to explain. 
People that are not in the know usually don't 
understand how important it is, for a seeker, to enter a 'blocked' database, or to try out 
useful software in its uncrippled form before deciding if it is worth buying or not.<br>
The Linux world has fortunately the GNU. The Free Software Foundation is dedicated 
to eliminating restrictions on copying, 
redistribution, understanding and modification of 
computer programs. This is worth, correct and the very reason of the 
triumphing future of a free system like GNU/Linux. The word "free", in this sense, 
refers to the freedom to copy a program and give it away to your 
friends and co-workers; <u>and</u> the freedom to change a program as you wish, 
by having full access to source code.<br>So it should be in our future 
world of shared knowledge and mutual induced evolution, where what we know 
and what we give (NOT what we 'own' and what we hide) will be the only 
parameters worth noticing.
<br>
Free source! Thattaway, you can study the sourcecode and learn how such programs 
are written.  
Hence you may then be able to port it,  you can improve it building on 
the shoulders of others, sharing your changes with them. This approach has proved so 
powerful that even the commercial powers that be cannot ignore the phenomenon any more. 
(Alas! Thorwald's apolitical 'Linux' kernel has 'stolen' the connection between 
the GNU project and aims and its own software... people shouldn't speak of 'Linux', they 
should always speak of 'GNU/Linux', to recall that the whole purpose of the new os, 
as its 'father' <font color=blue>[</font><a href="http://www.stallman.org/">Richard 
Stallman</a><font color=blue>]</font> said one hour ago, is to foster freedom, and sharing.<br>
<br>Free source, full access to source code, like in the GNU/Linux approach do not exist (yet) in the 
dark real world of the commercial bastards.<br><br>
Unfortunately the windows world is <u>the exact opposite</u>.<br>In the windoze world
 the aim is to outlaw reverse engineering. Every application comes with an 
'agreement' you are supposed to sign, where it is mostly explicity forbidden to reverse, 
disassemble or even study the guts of the program. Of course noone reads the stuff
contained in 
these EULAs (end user license agreements).<bR>They could actually 
have a clausel inside that impose you to give your 
firstborn son to the software company for what you know.<br>I suggest to 
those of you that are 
programmers to
write inside your own EULAs something stating that commercial entities are bound to give you 50 dollars 
for 
every minute they use the software. A clever lawyer (an oxymoron, alas&nbsp;:-) would probably 
be able to scare some companies into paying.<bR>
<br>Fortunately EULAs don't mean nothing and don't represent an obstacle at all, not 
even for your moral scruples: if you know how to reverse software, 
it is relatively easy to swap 
the texts on the buttons at the bottom before pressing them (you'll use for this <a href="../zipped/customiz.zip">the customizer</a>, as explained below. 
<br>Thus, after having changed the text on the botton, you'll press onto your new 
"I don't agree" 
tag in order to proceed 
installing the software&nbsp;:-)
<bR><bR>
In the windoze world every little programmer 
seems to believe that his appz is the center of the universe and that he may have 
the right to use its hidden features in order to spy 
on his clients, eventually establishing hidden connections in the background and syphoning 
data onto his own server. They also cripple software, limit its use, and even recur to 
'punitive actions' against anyone found having a copy of softice (a most powerful debugger) 
or of IDA (a most powerful diassembler) on his harddisk. You'll be able to find many examples of these 
<a href="../malware.htm">malwares</a> around.<br><br>
Should we allow unauthorized third parties to spy on our searching patterns and private data? 
Of course not, and to avoid snoopers we have more weapons up our sleeves than 
simple web-users seem to believe possible.

<font size=+2 color=blue>The galactic power of reverse engineering</font><br><font size=+1>
<br>
I wish, closing todays workshop, to show you a very simple technique to get rid of ANY 
advertismeent embedded in any software application whatsoever. Moreover I want to show you a technique 
so simple that even those among you that -alas for them- don't understand nothing 
of assembly and source code and software reversing techniques will be 
nevertheless able to get rid of the ads. Come to think of it, even their sons and beloved ones and 
friends and aunts will be able to do it.<br>As an added advantage, the big industry that 
was developing such pushing of 
advertisement sores through software (I frankly don't know how many 
million dollars they were supposed to make with these dirty deeds) is now 
once for all doomed, at least I hope, eheh.<bR>Reverse engineers as medieval knights, 
helping unaware 
fellow humans in peril. I love the picture. More wizards than knights maybe.<br><br>
Let's take as a practical example: <a href="../zipped/ferre302.zip">webferret</a>, a 
'free' software bot that you can (and should: it works very well) use to search the 
web. It is a very simple bot, yet useful even for experienced searchers. You can download for 'free' this 
 software, but it has unfortunately an horrible bug: a small window opens inside it 
and pushes awful advertising banners into 
your eyes until they get sore.<br>Moreover all these appz use their 
banners ALSO in order to track your habits: 
the clicking patterns of those among you that are really so stupid as to fall 
for  advert banners 
are of course registered, grepped and sold to third parties.
<br><br>
How would you proceed to 'ameliorate' this appz?<br>There are so many ways... 
a very simple one is through the width of the offensive banner.<br>
Look at the window dimensions: 63 height * 473 pixels width. (You can use 
either softice's hwnd -x command or a good ruler like sruler, or, again, simply 
the customizer 
itself).<br>
The two decimal numbers translate into 0x3F and Ox1D9 in hexadecimal and these values are 
<font color=blue>the starting point</font> (the 'hook')  
you would use to really reverse (or 'crack') this target

<hr>If you want to reverse this target as a software reverser would do, feel free to 
read my essay <a href="../frav_023.htm">frav_023.htm</a> for a complete explanation. 
As a side note for non-reversers savvy: keep <u>always</u>
in mind that there exict the so called '<font color=blue>Procustes</fonT>' method 
against all kind of advertisement banners. 
Indeed, in similar cases, once you find the correct location 
it would  probably  suffice to 
change the width byte sequence (1d9, i.e. 'slack' 1d8/1da... or whatever) to a <u>zero</u> byte sequence in order 
to "mutilate" the advertisement width reducing the 
banner to an invisible - and well-deserved - width of zero pixel&nbsp;:-)<br>
Of course disabling once for ever 
the offending advertisement window is even better than having it nuked but still working 
and pumping ads in the 
background. 

</font>
<hr>
If you don't know how to disable windows and don't have the time to learn how to reverse 
engineer software (a pity, if you ask me) you have <font color=blue>as a MUCH more simple alternative</font> the approach I 
would like to teach you today:
download <a href="../zipped/customiz.zip">the customizer</a>, a truly wondrous application, 
from my site and use its 'hide window' or 'disable window' or even 'minimize window' 
functions against any
 'advertisement culprit' target, like Webferret. Eheh:-)<br><br><font size=+2><font color=blue>
 The customizer's customization</font></font><br><br>
Have a look by yourself at the big screen behind my shoulders and gasp in 
awe at the mighty power of software reverse engineering (even at such a 
superficial and simpleton level): <ul><li>
download the customizer, fire it... see the nice yellow ball?</lI><li>
download webferret, fire it... see the ugly advertisement?</lI><li>
click 'edit window' inside the customizer</lI><li>
Check 'select' and click onto the 'on' button inside the customizer's big window</lI><li>
Click on webferret's hideus advertisement banner (as you can see there are A LOT 
of other hidden 'ghost' windows 
in a running windows operating system, you'll play with 
that stuff later, now let's simply disable the 
advertisment banner... look at the big screen behind my shoulders... nothing in my hands but 
a touchpad, eheh&nbsp;:-)</lI><li>
You see: Parentclass #32770, Handle 0x0e70, Height 63, Width 473</lI><li>
Now let's click on Customizer's 'misc' tag</lI><li>
Let's choose 'send mouse click' after having checked the 'minimize' option</lI><li>
See! How funny! We have minimized a window wich wasn't supposed to be minimized at all! See: 
it cannot go all the way down to the bottom bar, it hangs there 'in the air' inside webferret. 
Note that you can 
minimize everything... the icon with the blue globus as well if you fancy it (or you could 
substitute it with your own logo).</lI><li>
Let's choose 'send mouse click' now, after having checked 'close'... 
we'll send a closing message to advertisement window and kill it.</lI><li>
See? Puff! Bye bye ads... now you could compare the code in memory with the code of the 
original application and modify accordingly with any hexeditor. Webferret has  
been 'cleaned', its repulsive  
advertisement banner is no more... 
quod erat demonstrandi</lI></ul>

<br>Of course no real software reverser would loose so much time on this target, 
once you learn the 
art, you'll be able to find the culprit routines just 'feeling' the code 
and kill 
them changing - more often that you would believe - a single byte.<bR> 
I only wanted to show you a silly, extremely simple and very easy example 
          of the <font color=blue>galactic power</font> that 
software reverse engineering can give... even to zombies.<BR>
Free from the chains that your software would like 
to impose on you, you'll be able to recreate, at least in part, the 
free GNU atmosphere that you can enjoy in the GNU/Linux world. <br>
Probably too much power for single individuals.<bR>
No wonder that the commercial 
powers and their political lackeys in our parliaments 
are trying to outlaw these techniques and the very tools 
we use (and abuse) to perform this art.
<br><bR>

<font size=+2 color=blue>The secret path to reality cracking</font><br><font size=+1>
<br>

This is not only true for 
software.<bR>
The world around us is full of codes you are not supposed even to understand, least you may 
try to reverse them. They are there in order to control you and guarantee 
profits for somebody other. Codebars, embedded chips, pattern tracking algos, email 
grepping facilities, supermarkets' 'advantage' cards, pension funds pyramid schemes, a plethora of 
lotteries you'r mathematically certain to lose money into, mode, trends, 
pushed advertisement, even subliminal techniques... every single bait, 
of course, masked behind a supposed 'free' 
or 'cheap' usage. We should, I believe, always try to explain what's really 
going on 'under the hood' to the zombies and slaves roaming around 
and bumping from one consuming opportunity 
into the other, like flies 
against the walls of an upside-down glass.<bR>We should in particular teach 
our children to look behind the facades of the 
Potjomkin villages of this nice 'open' e-society we are condemned to live into.
<bR><bR>
But the time 
I have been allowed to use for this conference is almost finished, and we are now
far away from searching techniques and software reversing approaches, 
even if those techniques can be VERY powerful 
means in order to reach the aims I'm trying to describe.
<bR><br>
They want a static world of hidden features and codes you are not supposed even to understand, 
where they will be free to push advertisements down your throath at whim, 
making profit out of that. 
We want
a world of shared knowledge and evolution. A world where 'know' will mean a lot 
and 'own' won't mean much. 
We will win.
