<font size=+2 color=blue>Accessing info</font><br><font size=+1>
I hope you are not bored yet. The different "areas" we have examined above 
must be accessed using different techniques.<br>
I will try to explain you some 
of them. This will concentrate on the fundamental issues, since I could else speak hours only to explain you the differences 
among the main search engines. If you are really interested, the links I offer will bring 
you far away inside our jungle.<br><br>
In order to search effectively you must understand various techniques and apply them 
accordingly.

<font size=+2 color=blue>Searching</font><br><font size=+1>
In order to search effectively you must first of all understand the basic search 
approaches.<br>The web is full of search 'tutorials' and self-proclaimed search experts. Yet 
you'll soon realize (if you are - as you should - able to evaluate the results of 
your queries) that most of the information is 'hollow'. Have a look 
at a famous resource: Chris Sherman's <a href="http://www.websearch.about.com">http://www.websearch.about.com</a> for instance. The 
'best links' and 'oustanding tutorials' he refers to are, for instance, small and simple 
collections of elementary notions  
by Danny Sullivan 
(<a href="http://www.searchenginewatch.com">http://www.searchenginewatch.com</a>) and 
by the Libraries of the University at Albany (<a href="http://www.albany.edu/library/internet/boolean.html">http://www.albany.edu/library/internet/boolean.html</a>).
<br>There are sound (if evil) economic reasons 
for that: the lore of searching the web is nowaday 
a very valuable gift: just to make but one example: people gain a LOT of money 
placing sites in the best positions on the search engines (which is relatively easy once 
you reverse the pool of algos used by the main engines). Therefore real working (and in 
depth) searching tips 
are mostly offered by universities, educational sites and librarians.<br>
But there are (some) other possibilities to gain the knowledge. Apart from the relative 
help 
that people 
that still adhere to the spirit of the "web of old" can offer (give to be given), there 
are also valuable messageboards (where the search engines spammers exchange their dirty tricks, 
for instance: <a href="http://www.searchengineforums.com/bin/Ultimate.cgi">http://www.searchengineforums.com/bin/Ultimate.cgi</a> and 
<a href="http://www.webmasterworld.com/">http://www.webmasterworld.com/</a>), some documents about the 'guts' of the search engines (see for instance, 
on my site, <a href="file://localhost/f:/searchlores/altavi1.htm">altavista in depth</a> and 
and <a href="file://localhost/f:/searchlores/raging.htm">some oddities @ raging</a>).
Last, but by all means NOT least, you have also the possibility to 
build your own <a href="http://www.searchlores.org/bots.htm">search bots</a>.
<br>The main search engines, even if they are spammed, even if they sell the best (top 10) 
positions and
even if they take, of course, note of every activity and search you perform (sniffing is the very reason someone creates 
and gives you 'free' search engines, duh) <u>can</u> nevertheless be used for 'zeroing in' purposes.
<br>
As a simple rule of thumb <ul><li>USE MORE THAN ONE ENGINE (the real rule goes 
beyond search engines and reads 'use various resources')
</li><li>
KEEP ON TRACK
</li><li>
USE LOWERCASE AND SEARCH ENGINES 'MATH' (that is <font color=blue>+</font>, <font color=blue>-</font> and <u>booleans</u>)
</li><li>
USE PECULIAR STRINGS AND SPECIAL KEYWORDS (a typical case on alta is  <font color=blue>-"domain:com"</font> to avoid commercial crap)
</li><li>
USE PROXIMITY SEARCHES (NEAR, ONEAR etcetera, best search engine for this is Infoseek)
</li><li>
LEARN TO ARCHIVE AND ORGANIZE your search results
</li></ul>
La va sans dire that you should also learn how to evaluate the results you get and ditch 
without mercy all the noise you'll have to wade trough to reach your signal.<br>
<br>

<font size=+2 color=blue>Combing</font><br><font size=+1>
A very effective technique and approach: you search those that have already searched<br>
Since combing includes <u>a lot</u> of techniques, I'll go back to it when examining the local and regional 
search engines and usenet resources. If you want a short description: you lurk around usenet, maillists and 
messageboards trying to find some authorities in the matters you are seeking. Then you use 
the cumulated knowledge of these savy-people to jumpstart on your search. Some social engineering, stalking and klebing 
capacities are also required.
<br><br>

<font size=+2 color=blue>klebing, luring, stalking</font><br><font size=+1>
In order to find the outside linkers and the lurkers and leechers' treasures<br>
The 'combing' approach is useful in order to find treasures hoarded by people that 
are willing to share what they know and have found. Unfortunately, in a more and more 
'commercial' web, the number of bastards that 'hide' what they have found is increasing. 
Most of the juicy hidden sites are in the 'outside linkers' part of the web, with no link 
pointing back to them.<br>How do we find them?<br>The most used method is klebing.
<br>Basically klebing is using the information found inside the referral fields of your loggings 
when the 
target visits your site. In a list of referrers taken from my site 
loggings you can find, 
for instance, many urls belonging to more or less useful messageboards of the 
professional search engines spammers, like 
the url <a href="http://www.webmasterworld.com/forum10/112.htm">http://www.webmasterworld.com/forum10/112.htm</a>. 
<bR>The point is that very few people use proxies when surfing, and even less can resist the 
immediate temptation to click on a link they find on a page or receive per email, especially if 
it has a juicy promise.<bR>The trick is to lure your target on an interesting page of yours 
and keep updating it until he will land there COMING FROM HIS OUTSIDE LINKER SITE. Alternatively, 
a common trick is to caper <u>a public email account</u> of your target, using common 
luring tricks, stalking/guessing techniques or bruteforcing it.<br>Once you have done it, read 
his private stuff until you know where his servers are located better than he does.<br>
Of course this could be slightly illegal, but klebing is an aggressive technique and 
there are no fixed rules on the web anyway.<br>
If you just wonder how you can caper an email account, and would like 
to try it out for knowledge purposes, you may try <a href="http://www.searchlores.org/siluring.htm">this 
technique</a> on one of your 
own accounts.
 <br><br>
<font size=+2 color=blue>guessing and hacking</font><br><font size=+1>
The art to get to the roof.<br>
<br><br>There are may ways to find info on a target website<br>
-  Browse their FTP site looking for hidden directories<bR>
-  Browse their FTP site looking for stuff out in the open that they have forgotten about<bR>
-  Use a FrontPage attack (there are many)<bR>
-  Exploit weaknesses in Active Server Pages<bR>
-  View the source of pages (especially registering and purchasing online pages)<bR>
-  And my favorite:  Guessing<br><bR>
Guessing is an extremely important lore in a web where "nomen est omen". If you find a 
database where you have as subdirectory structure something like:<br>
<font color=red>http://www.targetsite.com/juicy/demos/a.zip</font><bR>
I would, if I were you, first of all try to fetch the robots.txt of the site 
(We already spoke of the simple technique of checking the robots.txt file (the exclusion 
listing for automated spiders) in order to find 'unallowed' subdirectories. There is also
an automated "robots.txt" checker (@ The University of Edinburgh) that can do the job, for instance on 
Luc's mirror of my site:
<br><a href="http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/cgi/sxw/parserobots.pl?site=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.2113.ch%2Frobots.txt">
http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/cgi/sxw/parserobots.pl?site=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.2113.ch%2Frobots.txt</a>
<br> Anyway,  
failing to fetch it, I would try to guess:<br>
<font color=red>http://www.targetsite.com/juicy/downloads/a.zip</font><bR>
The key to guessing is research.  Look around at their website and see what they name things and where they put things.  
Look at pictures and links and downloads.  
<br>


<br>
Let's, moreover not forget how useful will be our holy software 
reversing skills each time we'll decide to use some of the many tools 
that the Web offers to track down our targets (tools that are unfortunately 
at times crippled or simply too short-lived :-)
<br><br>



But even simple searching is not all that simple: in order to 
search effectively you must first of all understand some of the 
most important differences between the main search engines.<hr width=44%>
