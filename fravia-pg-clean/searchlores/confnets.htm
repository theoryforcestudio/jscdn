Dear fravia+, 
Since the first time I started to explore the dedalous of what you call 
your fortress, I was baffle on how you manage to crystalise and give 
away such a huge amount of information. Although knowing nothing about 
reverse engineering, searching nor anonymity, nevertheless I became a 
regular (avid) visitor; slowly learning -mostly by osmosis. 
As I saw bright stars rising through various essays, I never thought I 
could be able one day to propose my little brick to your edifice :) 
Perhaps, this day has arrived. Thanks to you. 
Kind regards and be well. leFaF's "Configuring Netscape to use proxy"
 <HR size=1> <P>Here follow my "comments" on your seasonal feelings.<P>When I saw the very nice drawing on fravia+'s autumnal page, I was wondering
where I could be on the picture.<P>On the shore waving goodbye to the boat and its captain, well, no.
<BR>Under the sea swimming round and around big fishes, yet , no.
<BR>One of the personage, aboard the lean drakkar sailing away, this time
again, no.<P>And they were sailing away...<P>At this point, I started to realise that I had been just a spectator
entertained by what he and other freely gave away.
<BR>All of a sudden I felt like a peeping-tom.
<BR>A taker, not a giver.<P>And they were sailing away...<P>What can I do: I do not want to be left, I hate to be under, I cannot
be aboard... What is left?<P>Although obvious since the beginning, the answer finally came bright
and clear: give, share, participate.<P>All of a sudden I felt free, free as a bird...<P>I was flying away.

<BR>&nbsp;<P>But hey, wait, why should I surf anonymously and, by the way, what is
a proxy?
<BR>A scary answer can be found <A HREF="noanon.htm">here</A>.
To put is strait, when you are in the comfort of your computer room, all
alone with your machine, nobody knows what you are doing, right.
<BR>Wrong!
<BR>You splatter information about yourself all over the world. It's kind
of walking naked in a crowded boulevard with your ID card hanging on your
neck...
<BR>Oh!
<BR>On the Wild Web, there are nasty things like cookies, hostile applets
and java scripts, browser security holes, assholes, log files and much
more...
<BR>Septic? The Joker can tell you <A HREF="http://1194street.hypermart.net/joker/joker.cgi" tppabs="http://1194street.hypermart.net/joker/joker.cgi">here</A>
what he knows about you. And you, do you know him?
<BR>Surprising, isn't it?
<BR>Now you might desire to become a bit more invisible, aren't you? If
you do so, here are a few tips.<P><B>Cookies</B>
<BR>A simple way to refuse cookies is to change the attributes of the cookie
file to read-only. But delete the content first!
<BR>- In Netscape look for cookies.txt
<BR>- In Opera cookies.dat<P><B>Java Script</B>
<BR>As most java scripts are not really interesting, just turn this off.
<BR>- Netscape: Edit Menu - Preferences - Advanced - Unchecked Enable Java
and JavaScript
<BR>- Opera: Preferences Menu - Multimedia - Unchecked Authorize JavaScript<P><B>Proxy</B>
<BR>A proxy server is a machine dedicated to handle web accesses and store
copies of documents on a local disk. Proxy sits on a gateway and passes
traffic across it. So when you use a proxy with your browser, rather than
connecting to a web site directly, your
<BR>browser will make a connection to the proxy first. The proxy then opens
up a connection to the specified web site and forwards it back to your
browser. The web site will "see" the proxy IP address, not yours.
<BR>Besides, connecting to a large proxy may speed up your connection times
considerably.
<BR>But beware all proxies are not anonymous. Some may give out your IP
or a CGI script might find your IP behind the proxy.<P><B>Useful Proxy Related Links</B>

<BR>Check the reliability of a proxy <A HREF="http://ilatp.hypermart.net/cgi-bin/ip.cgi" tppabs="http://ilatp.hypermart.net/cgi-bin/ip.cgi">here</A>&nbsp;
(Take a look at the line HTTP_FORWARDED to see if your proxy is anonymous)

<P>Finally, here is a way to configure Netscape Communicator to surf anonymously
via the proxy of your choice<P><B>Procedure</B>
<BR>1.&nbsp; Trust me. Do you? (:)
<BR>2.&nbsp; Cut and paste the text between the 2 lines below. Save it as viaprox.pac in the directory of 
<bR>your choice. I use c:\Proxy\viaprox.pac in the example. 
<bR>The 3 proxies inserted are functional now (20.11.98) but you'd better find your own.

      As you have already noticed, the viaprox.pac at fravia/confnets has to be 
      somewhat adjusted to work properly.<br>
      This little essay was done fast, and I have overseen some details. 
   <br><br>
      Sorry for the fast _found it, take away, people_ who have missed 
      the ever evoluting process.<br>
      For the other, take it as a challenge to do better.<br>
      Anyway, the general idea was to use the file that ANY proxy 
      server use, right into your comfty PC.
<br><br>

      For the sake to go a bit further, here are two working (!?) pac 
      files for you to probe.
<br>
      ezeprox.pac will use the same cache for http, ftp and gopher.<br>
      You just have to replace "proxy_u_like1&2.com" by the proxy of 
      your choice. If there are no proxy available,
      Netscape will ask if you want a direct connection.<br>
      In dayprox.pac, the proxy -for http only- will change everyday. 
      Woody!
<br><br>
      Your comment, improvement and suggestion are most welcome.
<br><br>
      Be well<br>
