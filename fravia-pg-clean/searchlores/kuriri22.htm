Be warned: this is not for the philosophically impaired. If you are not interested by 
 concepts like "sense of justice", "soul versus bodies" and similaria you better leave right now, 
or prepared to be bored. However if you do remain and read, there is matter for quite some 
thoughts here. Philosophical reversing is quite a tool <i>per se</i>.<bR>
 Kuririn love for 
his 'Platonic order' transpares in this short essay, that will appeal to readers 
that do think about their place in the society.<br>
What I personally doubt, here, is that we live in a democracy that allows anyone to 
decide by himself. Far from it: the amount of power in the hands of those that 
I call 'conditioners' or 'slave masters' is staggering. <bR>
Babies are pavlovianically indoctrinated (through <i>inter alia</i> TV and advertisement) 
since their early years. No wonder they have almost no brain left when they  later 
smoke their Camel standing on their Nikes inside their MacDonald. I wouldn't dare 
to believe that such zombies would be able to 
make a "distinction between what is natural and what conventional 
in our behavior and desires".    In other words I believe that the 'relishes' Kuririn is 
speaking of are IMPOSED ad hoc, in order to create <i>eo ipso</i> slaves of 
an inhumane oligarchy, not of their bodies.

I've composed a few words (not a strong essay... not even an essay!) but 
take a look and see if it is 
worth putting up on your r/c section. Many will be able to contribute to it 
(if they care to). i know 
that you will -wonder- about mention of the soul. let me clarify (this is 
not a christian soul, i.e., 
not immortal nor is ). it is 
an order that Plato presupposes in men comprised of three aspects 
eros/thymos and logos. Each 
is naturally part of Platonic psychology (n.b., that social science 
pshychology does not mention 
the soul yet not the etymology!). Thymos is the aspect of the soul which 
discerns intent in others 
and manytimes in nature itself (stub a toe on a rock, kick the rock ;) (it is 
the root of Rousseau's amore propre or similar to it). A thymotic soul if 
properly educated is 
in Plato's Repulbic -a guardian or defender-. In other words thymos is the 
sense of justice in men 
which compels them to defend their own. The point is (while not getting 
into the subtleties) the Platonic soul 
does not have to carry with it any odd notions of religion. I suppse (since 
this a rough rough 
draft) much will need to be clarified. good.

by the way please remove my old essay on aspartame (blow it up, drop it in 
a vat of acid etc.) <bR></fonT><br>
Of course I wont remove anything, unless he sends a new and better version as 
substitution, eheh :-)<br><hr width=88%>

Public opinion enslavement and soul</fonT><br>by Kuririn, April 2000<bR></center> 
  <hr width=44%>
The great democratic danger is enslavement to public opinion. The tyranny 
of the majority 
as this danger is frequently refered to is in essence oppositional to the 
claim of democracy (or the 
founding principle of democracy). The claim of a democracy is that every 
mand decides for himself (independent of any imposed authority), i.e., Each 
man decides for himself what is good or bad. Differently stated democratic 
man applies reason to make judgements which do not accept any authority 
outside of natural reason. The great danger for democracy then appears 
based on a limitation of the natural ruling class in a democracy. 
   <bR><bR>
In a democracy the prejudices normally associated with relgion, class and 
family are leveled not only in principle but also in fact. This follows 
naturally from the former statement concerning democratic man's dependence 
on his own faculties to discern what is good and bad, i.e., the dependence 
of democratic man on his own reason. In other words each man in a democracy 
is his own authority or in effect a self-governing body. Men who actively 
seek for an authority outside of their own reason will not find it within 
established tradition or that tradition as a tie to the ancient is no 
longer accessible for men who seek such an authority.<br>In other words, this 
does not mean that there is no access to ancient thought (e.g., the 
University) but that the promulgation of antique wisdom or authority in a 
democracy is not rooted in such a way that supports the illusion of 
pernamence hence the issue that antique wisdom or simply rootedness in 
tradition's inability to be established as a coercive structure (or an 
influenceing structure). But since very few democratic men school 
themselves in the use of reason beyond mere self-interest (self-interest 
which is supported by the regieme) they actually require an authority. Such 
a thought becomes particulary interesting when one considers Book II of the 
Republic, in particular the discussion between Socrates and Glaucon 
concerning the development of a city in speech (the city of sows).<br>The city 
of sows is according to Socrates -the true city- in which men have no other 
concern than 
there own bodily needs. The issue underlying this city in speech points to 
the distinction between what is natural and what conventional in our 
behavior and desires -- also what is the limit of convention based in 
nature. Rousseau takes nature to be the body and plausibly suggests that 
the body has relatively few needs and that it could not make man social or 
in need of other human beings in any significant or binding way. See 
Republic 369e-370a, and 372d-e for the possibility that Socrates agrees at 
least this far: the body has few needs and if it were all, we would be 
self-sufficient. Were we to apply art to the needs of the body we begin to 
speak in terms of human flourishing or fulfilment -- each can provide for 
himself, but one man can bring one art to greater perfection, so 
specialization and cooperation allow art to advance. But bringing an art 
to perfection is not enough to satisfy a human being; the city of sows is 
comically half-souled: its citizens lack any thymos, they kill their own 
babies and never seek luxuries because they realize that this would lead to 
war in the long run. The luxurious or feverish city is taken up by 
Socrates without much protest except to say that the former was the "true 
city" which means that cities can provide the body with what it needs and, 
if we did not have souls, the body would not need much. It is only because 
we have souls that are unsatisfied that we confuse the needs of the soul 
with the body and have to provide our body with so many 
things. This includes lovers and wives.<br>So the Republic also shows that 
human beings mistake the needs of the soul for those of the body.<br> 
Therefore, while the body only needs grain and vegetables to thrive, we try 
to feed the hunger in our soul with relish upon relish. Since relishes cost 
money, captialism thrives on this dissatisfaction of soul, as it encourages 
consumption of material goods and thereby enslavement to the market where 
you can buy these things and sell yourself to earn the money to buy more. 
Captialism is therefore a vicious circle, depriving the soul and feeding it 
ersatz nourishment. Only the rarest of individuals will recognize his true 
needs for what they are while still young and flexible in soul. Old regimes 
offered some world interpretation that resembled philosophy in hierarchical 
form if not content; they therefore provided some guidance or "pointed" 
towards philosophy. Today only the University can do so by preserving these 
old ways of thinking, and philosophy alongside them, and supporting withal 
the "illusion of permanence" which otherwise would have to be offered by 
the regime or not at all. The issue is then not explicitly limited to 
capitalism but democracy itself. In other words I want to emphasize the 
extent to which democracy and not merely capitalism is our cave, and hence 
the true nature of that which has to be overcome. 
         <bR><bR>
Now, in a democracy where men do not have recourse to a tradition should 
they require authority they will not find one rooted in tradition. On the 
one hand this opens up the problem stated at the beginning of the paragraph 
(no doubt what supports the moral authority of the majority given that a 
single man who doubts his own good or ends being unable to turn to a 
natural authority in himself turns to the only available power, i.e., the 
soveeriengty of the will of the people). On the other hand this appears to 
presuppose that men are not in the absolute sense connecting the idea of 
what is good with self-interest as an end which is good. Since even the 
self-interest about which they calculate--the ends--may become doubtful. 
Differently stated self-interest as an end which is supported by the 
regieme is not enough for some men (becomes a matter for doubt) and as such 
indicates that something else is needed which must exist (perhaps) 
independently from the regieme but necessarily supported by it. I suspect 
that this is the place for the University. The underlying implication is 
that very few men have the capacity to rely on their own faculties 
naturally in the fullest sense or that very few men are completely 
self-sufficent. In other words "The active presence of a tradition in a 
man's soul gives him a resource agains the ephemeral {or the prevailing 
passions which are subject to change easily from moment to moment} the kind 
of resource that only the wise can find simply within themselves." 

        <bR><bR>
All in democracy are equal and therefore apparently the opposite of slaves. 
However, as is always the case, the political model stamps its character 
into the souls of the citizens. Only this one does so invisibly, by 
destroying alternative ways of thought in the name of liberating its 
citizens. Although all are free to make their own decisions pertaining to 
their own life, collective action is absolutely necessary to secure these 
rights, maintain law and order, deal with foreign nations, etc. The modern 
democratic solution is, faute de mieux, the will of the majority 
(represened by the legislature, executive, and justice system with juries). 
By analogy this carries over into psychology. Each citizen claims to be 
independent and follow his own opinion when it comes to private life; we 
all are taught to take pride in being ourselves. However, we are also 
taught to be team players. Not only politics but daily life requires 
cooperation and therefore consensus of opinion. Someone has to accomidate 
someone else, and when all are considered equal, it would be the height of 
vainglory for a minority to ask the majority for a significant concession. 
They might beg but they could have no moral claim, "no sense of superior 
right." Unlike open tyrants, the majority rulers do not require you not to 
contradict their opinions. However, they break the "inner will to resist" 
by denying that anyone is or can be better than anyone else, and therefore 
that proud disdain of the masses can be more than pathology. More than its 
physical might, the majority dominates with its control of juries (and 
editorial columns, etc.) and therefore of the semblance of justice. This is 
the confusion of nature and convention. N.B., the necessity for men to have 
an unscientific admixture of "nature and convention" --e.g., responding to 
natural needs (desires etc.) by embracing conventional solutions (marriage 
for love, etc.) In any event, since no firm voices declare principles 
contrary to democracy, one of many possible and humanly constructed regimes 
appears to wield the only natural or possible claim to justice. No 
alternative remains visible within democracies, and democracy is therefore 
the only regime that does not somehow point beyond itself, or leave any 
sign to direct the wayward soul dissatisfied with its neighborhood but not 
knowing where to go. 
            <bR><bR>
Americans talk a lot about individual right, and in fact they admire and 
applaud nonconformity -- so long as it conforms to the content of dominant 
opinions. This is done by anticipating where public opinion is going next, 
or radicalizing what is already held to be true, flattering the masses that 
they are capable of free thought when in fact they merely roll about in the 
mud like pigs. One example suffices, i.e., that of Marxists, who decry 
captialist democracy and bourgeois vulgarity in the name of a proletarian 
revolution -- a radicalized version of the working man's desire for more 
respect and less work and the white collar man's guilt about those less 
successful than he. This only underlines the nature of a democractic 
prejudice -- the equal right of all to pleasure or "indolency of body" as 
Locke put it.. 
     <bR><bR>
No one likes to believe that what he can see is limited by circumstances, 
no matter how easily he recognizes this effect in others.
