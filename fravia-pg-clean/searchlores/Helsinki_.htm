<br>


First of all, excuse my English, please, which in fact is not even my first foreign language.
<br>
<br>

I am honored to be here and to have been asked to open this conference. 
The title of my own contribution is "<font color=blue>The web: bottomless cornucopia & immense garbage dump</font>", 
and in fact, as we will see, the web is both: 
a shallow  cornucopia of emptiness and a deep mine of jewels, hidden underneath tons of commercial garbage.

<br><br>
This contradiction is only apparent: only slaves and patsy zombies are
 bound to wade up to their neck in the commercial mud that infests the web. Once you learn how to search,
the "<font color=blue>cosmic power</font>" of a seeker will allow you to cut through the web and find all the fruits of the cornucopia.<br>
Rhetorical grandstanding? You'll judge by yourself afterwards.

<br><br>
This will be a talk about contradictions. I will try to fulfill 
the impossible task of pointing out some of these contradictions and -at the same time- show some effective web-searching techniques, that 
will (should) allow anyone interested to take advantage from some of the very contradictions we will see.
<br><br>


The organizers of this event have chosen to give me two slots, therefore I will keep 
this introduction on a more "general" tone, and follow tomorrow with a more "concrete" oriented workshop. 
<br>
Hence those that 
wont be too bored today may chose to participate tomorrow to my "<font color=blue>FFF Wizardry: Finding forbidden fruits</font>" workshop, 
while those among you that will have had enough of this searching stuff will be able to 
switch to other talks.
<br><br>
Having two opportunities to talk to you is also convenient because I intend to touch <font color=blue>MANY</font> different 
search-related fileds, maybe too many.<br> 
Most talks in this kind of conferences are (correctly) incentrated on some specific aspects. This one will -instead- touch many different facets. I would like   
 to show you -today and tomorrow- a BROAD palette of searching techniques: many different ways to fetch your targets. 
It will be up to you, later on your own, to decide which 
ones you want to deepen and which ones may rest aside or be forgotten. 

<br>
<br>
A caveat:

some of the things we will see together today and tomorrow 
may prove useful to the "security" community, yet they could be misinterpreted  as 'malicious', 'inconvenient' or even 'slightly illegal' 
in some "copyright obsessed" countries.
<br> 
I am not, strictly speaking, 
a "security expert", rather a sort of 'insecurity' buff.

<br>
<br>

Please also note that I'm not always going to be politically correct, a severe handicap of mine. For instance
 I understand "copyright" as just "the right to copy" as much as one fancies. I may be wrong, of course, 
 but that's how I understand it&nbsp;:-) 
 <br><br>Yet 
 I'll <font color=blue>disclaim it now</font> (and only once): I am a seeker and I just 
 explain <font color=blue>how to search the web</font>. And the web is full of "copyrighted material" 
 and of many other weird things. <br>So take note: 
 I do not condone, nor promote, patents' infringement (a diffuse practice 
 that some useless lobbysts dare to call 
 "<font color=blue>piracy</font>"). The web 
 is quite international, yet every country has 
 its own -different- petty provincial laws. So get acquinted with the laws used during each  
 historical contingence in each  little "country" you happen to live in, 
 and do respect them, or else move elsewhere: the world is big.<br> 
 If you do respect laws (and this is of course up to you), some of the 
 queries listed below <font color=blue>should not be used</font> in some countries. You have 
 been warned. Enough: people should *always* respect laws, even the most stupid ones, or they should try to 
 change those laws. Breaking laws "from below" may be fun, but is mostly rather silly: clever people (and 
 all sorts of expensive lawyers) 
 find loopholes 
 instead.

 
<br>
<bR>

Also -as you can see- no powerpoint in my talks: 
 there's no need  to turn everything into a sales pitch, and  
with powerpoint even the few pre-chewed "ideas", hidden inside the bambinesque noise, 
are simplified to the point that they become redundant and unclear. 

<br>
<br>

We'll use good ole html instead. 
If anyone misses powerpoint, he may be comforted knowing that he will at least be able to 
follow <a target=_top href="http://www.searchlores.org/Helsinki_.htm">this talk on his own screen</a>.

<br>
<br>

Enough clich�s: I would like to examine,  with you, some of the most 
startling contradictions of the web. It isn't just a matter of curiosity: 
such findings may give us some clues about future developments, and -as we will see- may even 
help us to improve a little our searching skills: as you may know, 
knowing WHERE TO FIND an answer is tantamount to knowing the answer itself. And today's Internet is a truly huge concoction: 
everything that can be digitized is there, from music to images, from documents to books, from software to confidential memos.

<br>
<br>

The stake is very high:
if we learn to search effectively (and evaluate correctly our findings)  
 the entire human knowledge will become available, at our command and disposal, no matter where, or how, 
 somebody may have "hidden" our targets.
 
 <br>
 <br>
 
Most searching techniques are -a posteriori- very simple.
Build on your own on them and you wont need no-one 
no-more to explain <i>you</i> anything: you'll always quickly fetch your  own 
signals among the heavy commercial noise that contaminates and infects the web. 

<br>
<br>
To search and to fetch our targets we will use most of the time simple querystrings. Here an example, useful to fetch -of course for free- 
a very good 'anti-streaming' application 
(more on anti-streaming techniques 
later and tomorrow): <IMG SRC="images/bulletr.gif" ALT="red" align="bottom" valign="bottom" WIDTH="13"

 <br><font size=+1>

 
Btw, note how useful such a querystring can be even WITHOUT specifying the 
software you want to fetch 
(in this case <font color=blue>+"Stream Down"</font>): <font size=-1><center> <br>
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&c2coff=1&q=%28%22wares%22+OR+%22warez%22+OR+%22appz%22+OR+%22gamez%22+OR+%22abandoned%22+OR+%22pirate%22+OR+%22war3z%22%29+%28%22download%22+OR+%22ftp%22+OR+%22index+of%22+OR+%22cracked%22+OR+%22release%22+OR+%22full%22%29+%28%22nfo%22+OR+%22rar%22+OR+%22zip%22+OR+%22ace%22%29&btnG=Search">("wares" OR "warez" OR "appz" OR "gamez" OR "abandoned" OR "pirate" OR "war3z") ("download" OR "ftp" OR "index of" OR "cracked" OR "release" OR "full") ("nfo" OR "rar" OR "zip" OR "ace")</a>.
</font></center>
<br>
<br>


Please note that there's no point in 'writing down' such a querystring: 
try instead to understand <font color=blue>the reasons behind</font> the querystrings we will see together, don't 
just count on them as they are: 
the specific arrows we will launch today will not remain "sharp" for long. 
<br>Every-time I use 
a querystring to make a point during a lecture, that same 
querystring is often re-used many times over a very short time span,
 thus 'affecting' the web with a sort of
 <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=schroedinger%27s+cat&sp=1&_adv_prop=web&ei=UTF-8&vst=0&vf=all&vm=i&fl=0&n=10&SpellState=n-45894059_q-1WFts7Se4g1vVINk1BgMZgABAA%40%40">schroedinger's 
cat</a> effect: once you open the box and show it, the querystring may be dead.
<br>
Like arrows, our new sharp querystrings -once used-  slowly become blunt. Do not worry: 
your skill and understanding 
of the web will allow you to produce new, sharper ones: as many as you want.
<br>
<br>
Another interesting contradiction of a commercial infested web is that those very databases that have been 
created in order to sell (or to hoard) files (huge repositories of music files, books, images, software, you name it) 
lay open , or -ahem- 
"<a href="dpl.html">next to open</a>", 
at our disposal, once we learn some basic searching skills.<br>
 I have found such default accounts with their default passwords in almost every database I have visited. 
 Most admins allow such accounts to exists, whereby seekers (in fact any attacker) can easily gain access. 
Often these default accounts also have critical system privileges which should be of some interest for such a security 
oriented audience. I am sure you are all aware of the 
<a target=_top href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&safe=off&as_qdr=all&q=borland+%22politically+correct%22+interbase&btnG=Search">Borland Interbase's 
"politically correct"</a> exploit. Here for instance, another interesting list of <a href="oracle_default_passwords.txt">oracle_default_passwords</a>.
<br>
<br>
<font size=+2> <font color=blue>
The web was made for SHARING, not for selling and not for hoarding</font>, so -as we will see- 
its very "building bricks" deny 
to the commercial vultures the possibility of enslaving parts of it. This is but one of many www-contradictions.
</font>
<br><br>
But we do not have always to resort to 'tricks': the 'real' web of knowledge 
is still alive and kicking, albeit unconfortably buried underneath the sterile sands of the commercial desert. This is 
very important for seekers, it means that we have a 
'double' edge: we can exploit more or less freely all commercial repositories <font color=blue><i>and</i></font> 
we are able to quickly find the relevant scientific public ones.

<br><br>

A quick look at what  <a href="Helsinki_.htm#structure">the web looks like from a searcher's point of view</a> may prove useful before continuing.
<br>
Some points: 
<ul><li>
Nobody knows <font color=blue>how big the web is</font>. Estimates hover around 600 billion 
documents. Note that there's an "invisible" (or "deep") "hidden databases" 
web and a "visible" (or "surface") web.
<br> 
The "hidden databases"
web is
  made out of  
 dynamic, not persistent, pages.<br> 
The content of these searchable databases can only be found by a direct query. 
 Such pages often possess a unique URL address that allows them to be retrieved again later, yet 
 without a direct query, the database does not publish a specific page.
 <br>
The "hidden databases" invisible/deep web is supposed to be (potentially) at least 500 TIMES bigger than the visible/surface web. This isn't too 
far-fetched: just to 
make an example, the <a target=_top href="http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/home.shtml">Human Genome Project</a> was adding in 2003 more than 7 
terabytes (more than 7 times 10^12 bytes) of new data to its databases PER DAY!<br>
Most researchers believe the visible "surface" bulk to be around 32 Billion (milliards) pages, only less than one half
 of it covered by the main search engines. It is still growing, albeit at 
a slower pace than some years ago.<br><br>
<center>
<i>"My index's bigger than yours, nah, nah, nah, nah"</i><br><br>
</center>
Yahoo announced a month ago that it had indexed 19 Billion (milliards) documents.
Google now claims to index 11 Billion (milliards) pages (but the 'official' number is still 8,168,684,336 docs, so we'll stick to it), a few days after 
Yahoo 'bigger index' claim, google doubled its  number of <a target=_top href="http://images.google.com/imghp?hl=en&tab=wi&q=">indexed images</a>, 
 (now  -allegedly- 2,187,212,422).
</li><br><li>We'll examine such Yahoo/Google indexes claims <a href="Helsinki_.htm#note_Yahoo">below</a>, note however that all these data are next to irrelevant for seekers: 
all the <a href="main.htm">main search engines</a> TOGETHER cover just LESS THAN ONE HALF (and probably less than a quarter) of the "visible" web, and only scattered 
pages of the "hidden databases" (depending from link encountered on the static pages).
<br>
This limit is VERY IMPORTANT for searchers, combined with the fact that the main search engines do not overlap much (see below) it means 
 that you should use OTHER searching techniques instead of relying on the <a href="main.htm">main search engines</a> (or, even worse, on 
 google alone).
</li><br><li>
Search engines list only <font color=blue>the first part</font> of any <font color=blue>BIG DOCUMENT</font>: 
the size varies.<br> 
Google had a famous limit of 101K, which was abolished last January,  the new limit should be around 150K. These 
limits are very annoying when dealing with large documents (or on-line books).
</li><br><li>
The DIAMETER of the web is supposed to be still around "19 clicks": two randomly chosen
documents on the web are on average 19 clicks away from each other.
This  "shortest path" between two pages, measured using bots able
 to track and count hyperlinks, <a target=_top href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=2&url=http%3A//arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/9907038&ei=bNcKQ__fCrTmwQGepuC2DQ">was around 19 clicks  at the beginning of the year 2000</a> 
 and it should be around <font color=blue>23 clicks</font> if we take account of the hidden databases. The diameter does 
not increase proportionally with the growth of the Web. This is VERY IMPORTANT for searchers, it means 
 that <font color=blue>any information</font> is -and always will be- just a
few clicks away.
</li><br><li>
<font color=blue>Outside linkers</font> are fetched through klebing, stalking and social engineering
</li><br><li> 
<font color=blue>The bulk</font> and the <font color=blue>outside linked </font> 
through combing and <a href="Helsinki_.htm#shortlong">short and long term seeking</a>
</li><br><li> 
The <font color=blue>hidden</font> (and commercial) <font color=blue>databases</font>, the "deep/invisible" web, are accessed through 
<a href="password.htm">password breaking</a> or <a href="magicfi.htm">guessing</a>, social 
engineering or, more simply, just seeking one of the many lists of 
databases' 
hardcoded passwords and default accounts passwords we have seen before (we may also delve, tomorrow, into some 
common php scripts <a href="Helsinki_.htm#note_3">pestering php commercial vultures</a>). 
</li><br></ul>
<br>
<br>
From most of the above, we can easily understand that getting rid of the "commercial noise" is not an option, when 
searching effectively the web, it is a PRIORITY.

<br><br>
         CLEANING THE COMMERCIAL NOISE
         <br><br>
         Once upon a time, with most search engines, you could eliminate all those crap "*.com" sites adding the simple snippet <font color=blue>-"*.com"</font> in your querystrings.
         <br>
         Nowadays -for google- it does not work anymore: you have to use the ad hoc <font color=blue>-site:com</font> specifier.
       
 <br><br>  
   To make an example that some of you will enjoy, the banal querystring  
    <a target=_top href="http://www.google.com/search?hs=J7P&hl=en&lr=&c2coff=1&client=opera&rls=en&q=%2B%28%22ddos+attack%22+OR+%22Denial-of-service+attack%22%29&btnG=Search">+("ddos attack" OR "Denial-of-service attack")</a>  
     gives you (now) 739,000 results.
    Can we do better? Yes of course... let's kill all those useless "com" sites: <a target=_top href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&c2coff=1&client=opera&rls=en&as_qdr=all&q=%2B%28%22ddos+attack%22+OR+%22Denial-of-service+attack%22%29+-site%3Acom&btnG=Search">+("ddos attack" OR "Denial-of-service attack") -site:com</a> :
    316,000 results (now), mucho more cleano. 
    <br><br>
    I specified <font color=blue>(now)</font> because, yes, results amount diverge A LOT in different moments, 
    could depend from servers' overload or from the moon phase :-)
    <br><br>
    Some of you would probably think: great, then <font color=blue>this</font> is the way to go... just guess a correct queryterms sequence 
    and eliminate the ".com" sites, how simple and elegant...
    <br>
    Maybe when starting a broad 'el cheapo' search, but for a serious work
     on ddos attacks you may find more relevant signal using specific SCHOLAR search engines (and limiting the query to the most 
    recent 
    months): <br>
    <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?num=100&hl=en&lr=&c2coff=1&q=+ddos+%22june+%7C+july+%7C+august+%7C+september%22+%2B2005%22&btnG=Search">ddos "june | july | august | september" +2005"</a>
     This is a MUCH more useful ddos query<br>   
  However this is all simple googling: seeking, once more, is NOT (or only in part) made using the main search engines. 
    <br><br>
    In order to understand searching strategies, a lore which you'll find relevant for your security hobbies and for your real life as well,
     you have  to grasp not only how the web looks like, but also <font color=blue>how the web-tides move</font>.   
          <br>
    First of all the web is at the same time <font color=blue>extremely static</font> AND a <font color=blue>quicksand</font>, an oxymoron? 
    No, just another of the many contradictions we will see today. 
    <br> 
    <br>   
    See: Only less than one half of the pages available today will be available next year. <br>    
    Hence, after
a year, about 50% of the content on the Web <font color=blue><u>will be new</u></font>. The <font color=blue>Quicksand</font>. <br>

    Yet, out of all pages that are still available after one
year (one half of the web), half of them (one quarter of the web), have not changed at all during the year. The  <font color=blue>static</font> aspect
<br>
<br>Those are the "<font color=blue>STICKY</font>" pages.<br>
Henceforth the creation of new pages is a much
more significant source of change on the Web than the
changes in the existing pages. Coz relatively FEW pages are changed: Most Webpages are either taken off the web, 
 or replaced with new ones, or 
added <i>ex novo</i>.
<br>      
Given this low rate of web pages' "survival", historical
archiving, as performed by the Internet Archive, is of
critical importance for enabling long-term access to historical
Web content. In fact a significant fraction of pages accessible today
will be QUITE difficult to access next year.  
<br>
But "<font color=blue>difficult to access</font>"    means only that: difficult to access. In fact those pages will in the mean 
time have been copied
in MANY private mirroring servers.
One of the basic laws of the web is that <br>
EVERYTHING THAT HAS BEEN PUT ON THE WEB ONCE WILL LIVE ON COPYCATTED ELECTRONS FOREVER<br>
How to find it, is another matter :-)

<br><br>
Now let's have a small, simple example: another contradiction is the fact that VERY OLD exploits REMAIN ALWAYS VALID  and can 
be used ("<i>The web is a sticky quicksand</i>"):

<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hs=i92&hl=en&lr=&c2coff=1&client=opera&rls=en&q=%22Linksys+wireless+internet+camera%22++main.cgi&btnG=Search">"Linksys wireless internet camera"  main.cgi</a> (this 
is as old as the Cuckoo, but should still work).
<br>
So we learn that "Linksys wireless internet camera"   has a problem with its main.cgi,
Let's search for this <a target=_top href="http://www.google.com/search?client=opera&rls=en&q=inurl:%22:1024/main.cgi?%22&sourceid=opera&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8">inurl:":1024/main.cgi?"</a>
and let's exploit it: <br>
<a target=_top href="http://crbr.dyndns.org:1024/main.cgi?next_file=img/main_fs.htm">http://crbr.dyndns.org:1024/main.cgi?next_file=img/main_fs.htm</a>
<br>
changed to
<br><a target=_top href="http://crbr.dyndns.org:1024/main.cgi?next_file=/etc/passwd">http://crbr.dyndns.org:1024/main.cgi?next_file=/etc/passwd</a>
<br>
q.e.d. Quod erat demonstrandi.
<br><br>
So where would we seek exploits gathering sites?
<br><br>
I am of course NOT giving 
to the broad nasty public the real juicy messageboards (you may find them on your own if you learn how to search), yet,
for a start, apart well-known oldies like <a href="http://www.cert.org/nav/index.html">CERT</a>, <a href="http://www.securityfocus.com/">securityfocus</a>
(bugtraq) and so on, you may want to have a look at 

<a target=_top href="http://www.metasploit.com/">metasploit</a>, <a target=_top href="http://nvd.nist.gov/">Icat</a> 
and the awfully USA-oriented <a target=_top href="http://cve.mitre.org/">Common Vulnerabilities Exposures</a>. 
But I'm not an exploit expert, and I am sure that my friend <a href="http://www.t2.fi/english/#C0915">Halvar Flake</a> will have a lot to teach us about these matters 
during this very conference&nbsp;:-)
<br><br><center><font color=blue size=+3>
Simple searching rules</font></center>
<br><br>
   Some simple rules when searching:<br><ol><li>
always use more than one search engine! "<i>Google alone and you'll never be done!</i>" <br>
And yet there's a reason, after all, if I'm often (by all means <font color=blue>just often</font>) using <font color=blue>google</font> for my examples:
Indeed it is VERY EASY to understand that google's algos are better than Yahoo's or MSNsearch's ones.<br>
Security experts could experimentally try the following search: <br><font color=blue>making per host attack activity ranking</font>
<br><br>(adding <font color=blue>making per</font> to the <font color=blue>host attack activity ranking</font> query kills some noise)
<br>
<br>Ok, let's have a look on 
<a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=making+per+host+attack+activity+ranking&prssweb=Search&ei=UTF-8&fr=FP-tab-web-t&fl=0&x=wrt">yahoo</a>, 
on <a target=_top href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&q=making+per+host+attack+activity+ranking&btnG=Search">google</a> or on

<a target=_top href="http://search.msn.com/results.aspx?q=making+per+host+attack+activity+ranking&FORM=QBHP">msn</a> and examine the relevance of the results
<IMG SRC="images/bulletr.gif" ALT="red" align="bottom" valign="bottom" WIDTH="13"
HEIGHT="13">&nbsp; see?
<br><br>
</li><li>Always use lowercase queries! "<i>Lowercase just in case</i>" <br>
When in doubt, always use lowercase text, even for names. When you use lowercase, the search algos usually find both upper and lowercase results. 
When you use upper case text, the search algos usually find only upper case results. This is NOT true for google (google assumes all search terms are
lowercase and ignores punctuation, hence whatever you input -unfortunately- 
will be treated as lowercase), but it is still true for most correctly behaving search engines, so adhere to it.
<br>
e;g: When you search for clinton, you'll find clinton, Clinton, CLinton and CLINTON  in your result pages. 
However, when you search for Clinton, only pages containing <font color=blue>Clinton</font> will/should appear in the search results.
<br><br>
</li><li>
Go <a href="regional.htm">regional</a>! "<i>For Hindi stuff, nothing beats a <a target=_top href="http://www.google.com/intl/hi/">Hindi</a> 
search engine</i>:-)" (an 
<a target=_top href="http://www.shabdkosh.com/">online</a> english-Hindi dictionary may prove useful for non-Hindi savvy seekers)<br>
For instance, for pirated software (and many other things) <font color=blue>go chinese</font>, and I do not mean only 
<a target=_top href="http://www.baidu.com">Baidu</a> and <a target=_top href="http://www.163.com/">Netease/www.163.com</a> -which have been censored.<br>
A simple
"chinese google" will do: <a target=_top href="http://www.google.com/intl/zh-cn/">http://www.google.com/intl/zh-cn/</a>, of course you will
also  
need some useful translation tables (more on "languages searching" <a href="Helsinki_.htm#languages">tomorrow</a>):<br>

HSPACE=0></td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(Thanks <a target=_top href="http://www.start.com.my/">blewtooth</a>!)</td></tr></table></center>



<br><br>




</li><li>Always use more searchterms, <font color=blue>not only one</font> "<i>one-two-three-four, and if possible even more!</i>" 
(5 words searching);<br>

 A good method is the  <a href="synecdoc.htm">synecdochical searching</a> approach,  the rhetorical or metaphorical substitution of a part for the whole, or vice versa. 
 In this approach the terms you add are synecdochically related to each other, 
 for instance (pure synecdochical) 
 <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=25&hl=en&lr=&c2coff=1&q=%2BSERP+%2B%22search+engines%22+%2Brelevant&btnG=Search">+SERP +"search engines" +relevant</a>, 
 or (semanthic related) <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=25&hl=en&lr=&c2coff=1&q=+paper+goatskin+parchment+vellum&btnG=Search"> paper goatskin parchment vellum</a>, 
 or (historically related) 
 <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=25&hl=en&lr=&c2coff=1&q=%2Brouen+%2B%28%22aix-la-Chapelle%22++OR+aachen%29+%2Bfortunatus&btnG=Search">+rouen 
 +("aix-la-Chapelle"  OR aachen) +fortunatus</a>... 
 and you may add a date to the last query for the "<font color=blue>woah</font>" effect&nbsp;:-)
 <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=25&hl=en&lr=&c2coff=1&q=%2B754+%2Brouen+%2B%28%22aix-la-Chapelle%22++OR+aachen%29+%2Bfortunatus&btnG=Search">+754 +rouen +("aix-la-Chapelle"  OR aachen) +fortunatus</a>.
 <br>
Note that -as in the case of <font color=blue>("aix-la-Chapelle"  OR aachen)</font>- this <a href="synecdoc.htm">synecdochical 
searching</a> approach is often related to the linguistic approach 
that we'll examine more in depth <a href="Helsinki_.htm#languages">tomorrow</a>.<br><br>
Basically, you should move from general to particular and from particular to general all the time. From part to whole, from whole to part.
 
 <br><br>




</li><li>Remember that searching is a PROCESS, made out of different phases. You usually 
begin with  a broad query on some <a href="main.htm">main</a> search engines (more than one). 

 <font color=blue>As you pick up information during your search, you will use it to modify or refine your query</font>.
 
 Once you have a nice palette of terms related to your target, you can begin to <font color=blue>go inside</font> the 
 web through <a href="https://searchlores.nickifaulk.com/rfegional.htm">regional</a> searches, <a href="local.htm">specialized</a> searches, 
 <a href="irc.htm">irc</a> searching, <a href="usenet.htm">messageboards</a> searching, <a href="https://searchlores.nickifaulk.com/targets.htm&quot;">target-related</a>searching 
 and so on...<br>
 You need to know something to find out something more.<br><br>
 And there is a huge difference between the "usual" searches and your own (few) "<font color=blue>long term</font>" searches.
 These are the two/three "searching passions" that anyone has: those targets that 
 he most cherishes, for work or (better) for pleasure. While for the usual "everyday" searches it is true that <font color=blue>if you do not 
 find what you are looking for in 15 minutes it probably 
 means that your search strategy is wrong</font>,  for any "<a href="Helsinki_.htm#shortlong">long term search</a>"  
 a week is not enough, a month is not enough, 
 a year is not enough. For my own searches I fear that my life wont be enough.<br><br>As said: 
  <font color=blue>You need to know something to find out something more</font>: this means that for those 
  targets you really cherish <font color=blue>you will have to become an expert</font>, both for searching <font color=blue>and for evaluation</font> purposes. 
  And -alas- the real world is not a frill/quick "<a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=opera&rls=en&q=-inurl:html+intitle:%22index+of%22+%2B(%22/ebooks%22%7C%22/book%22)+%2B(chm%7Cpdf%7Czip)+%2B%22For+Dummies%22&sourceid=opera&num=100&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8">for

One of the most startling contradictions of today.
Given the current problems with holy crusades and mauros' bombings, and adding to this the 
congenital urge of every "democracy"   
to control his citiziens' fingers until the elbows ("people willing to trade their
freedom for security deserve neither and will lose both"), ISPs are now bound to keep track of ALL loggings and emails of 
all their users, burning them on dvds and delivering them at once, for any whimsical reason, to the powers that be.
 <br>Even if you encrypt your communications with PGP (and very few people do it) 
  <font color=blue>traffic analysis</font> may still reveal what you're doing.  
  That's because the header of your encrypted packets  discloses source, destination, size, timing, and so on.
Hence a typical ISP logs EVERYTHING and then some: which sites bozo has visited, 
which pages he has seen, and which images, and how long, and when, and where... 
Now 
 with a little grepping, a tag of traffic analysis and maybe also adding 
his credit cards patterns, his airplane-trips & his supermarket fidelity card loggings (and whatnots)... op-la!  
his complete web-life-personal-political and sanitary-psychological profile is ready and bullet-proof. <br><br>
Is it?
<br><br>
Nope. In fact the other side of this very interesting contradiction 
is "<a target=_top href-"http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&q=%22index+of%22+wardriving&btnG=Search">wardriving</a>"

A relative guide to anonymity, by fravia+, Version September 2005<br> 

----------------------------------------- </center>
RULES <ol><li>
buy laptop <font color=blue>cash</font> and <font color=blue>elsewhere</font> (not 
with credit cards and not in areas where they know/remember you)</li><li>
wardrive in another part of the town, not the one you live in</li><li>
download only, if you upload, upload <font color=blue>with care</font> just upload anonymous things or 
PGP encrypted stuff and use  
tor tunneling</li><li>
rotate your wifi card mac address at every access point: I use "Macmakeup" </li><li>
use wardriving laptop ONLY FOR THAT, no personal data whatsoever on it </li></ol>

TECHNIQUES <ol><li>
Find speedy, beefy first wifi accesspoint with netstumbler: there are so many unprotected 
at all that you don't even need to 
   bother firing a wep-packets-analyzer to crack their weak WEP-encryptions </li><li>
connect, browse, download, all shields down, javascript, java, the whole bazaar: who cares? </li><li>
ISP "A" will register everything "he" does. </li><li>
work half an hour, download the helluja out of it, upload with care</li><li>
walk/drive ten meters: change access point</li><li>
ISP "B" will now register everything "another he" does. </li><li>
work half an hour, download the helluja out of it, upload with care</li><li>
walk/drive ten meters: change access point </li><li>
...repeat at leisure... </li><li>
(reformat hard disk -or, better, restore image- every week or so, just in case) </li><li>

next day another part of the town, or another town :-) </li><li>

and so on...</li></ol></font></td></tr></table></center>

<br><br>
So it is incredibly easy to be 'somebody else' and then whomever wants to reconstruct your activities 
will have to find (and path-reconstruct and join) quite a lot of different people loggings. 
As I said in any big town you just need to move ten meters  
 to find another access point (a different person, a different ISP). I made myself a small experiment: 
 <font color=blue>walking</font> (15 minutes) from my home to my workplace I found -lo and behold- 
 136 different access points:  
 more than one half of them without WEP encryption at all (as if it would matter).
<br><br>
WEP encryption is a joke, and anyone using <a target=_top href="http://www.kismetwireless.net/">Kismet</a> for GNU-Linux (source code <a target=_top href="http://svn.kismetwireless.net/code/trunk/">here</a>) 
or <a target=_top href="http://www.eeye.com/html/products/retina/index.html">Retina</a>  Wi-Fi scanner for Windoze can bypass it 
pretty quickly. <a target=_top href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/airjack/">Traffic Injection</a>, as my friend Cedric Blanchard pointed 
out a couple of months ago in Montreal, has dramatically decreased WEP cracking achievement time. And of course any 'Security professional'
(and any 'Insecurity professional') 
should in my opinion have a look at Biondi's <a target=_top href="http://www.secdev.org/projects/scapy/">Scapy</a>.
<br>But the real bigbrother/anonymiy contradiction is that there is not even the need to bypass weak WEP-encryptions: 
you'll find a plethora of completely open 
access points everywhere.<br><br>
Provided you are a tag careful whit your personal data -especially when uploading-  and provided 
you remember that <a href="file://localhost/C:/Program%20Files/Belarc/Advisor/System/tmp/(Father-6cc12126).html">THERE ARE MANY OTHER IDENTIFIERS</a> 
in your box -and not only your wifi MAC_address- you may browse the web with some amount of relative anonymity.
<br><br>
Yep,  what you saw was <a target=_top href="http://www.pcworld.com/downloads/file_description/0,fid,8078,RSS,RSS,00.asp">Belarc Advisor</a>, 
one of the many 'Audit/snooping' tools you may find useful to play with.

<br><i>The main search engines DO NOT overlap a lot
</i><br><br>
</center>


We will go deeper into non-main search engines searching techniques tomorrow. In order to search effectively a seeker must 
first of all master the <a href="main.htm">main</a> search engines. The most important ones are, at the moment,
<a href="google.htm">google</a>, msn and yahoo, but all the  
 s.e. listed in my <A HREF="http://www.baidu.com/gaoji/advanced.html" target="_blank">B</a><A HREF="http://www.kartoo.com/" target="_blank">k</a>:<A HREF="http://www.alltheweb.com/advanced" target="_blank">f</a><A HREF="http://search.lycos.com/adv.asp" target="_blank">l</A><a href="http://www.altavista.com/web/text?" target="_blank">a</a><a href=http://groups.google.com/advanced_group_search target="_blank">n</a><a href="http://www.google.com/advanced_search" target="_blank">g</a><A HREF="http://www.infospace.com/info.xcite/" target="_blank">e</a><a target=_top href="http://web.archive.org/collections/web/advanced.html">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://fravia.2113.ch/phplab/scroll.htm" target="_blank">o</a><A HREF="ftp.htm" target="_blank">f</a><A HREF="http://www.wisenut.com/" target="_blank">&nbsp;</a><A HREF="http://search.msn.com/advanced.asp" target="_blank">m</a><A HREF="http://search.yahoo.com/web/advanced" target="_blank">y</a><A HREF="http://s.teoma.com/AdvancedSearch?q=" target="_blank">t</a><A HREF="http://www.hotbot.com/adv.asp?prov=Inktomi&tab=web" target="_blank">h</a><a target=_top href="http://a9.com/-/search/advSearch">&nbsp;</a>
 are imho important (and I think we should at least add <a href="main.htm#gigab">gigablast</a> and <a href="main.htm#exalead">exalead</a>
  to this not-exhaustive list.<br><br>

But let's start with google, at a well deserved number one position. If you'r using google for web-searching purposes (not for 
images or news finding), you may choose to use an IP-address instead of the <a target=_top href="http://www.google.com">http://www.google.com</a> URL.
For instance  
<a target=_top href="http://66.249.93.104/">http://66.249.93.104/</a>: one of the many real "googles" that 
wont  redirect you to your provincial crap, as it happens when you use
 <a target=_top href="http://www.google.com">http://www.google.com</a> URL.
<br><br>
The main reason google is more effective than most other search engines is its ability to correctly 
nuke
 all variations of a given URL that are dynamically generated from the same clown-server, a well-known SEOs spammer trick.<br><br>
Search engine result quality is in fact <font color=blue>FIRST</font> a function of <font color=blue>how the index is created</font>.
Even so google's results are still HEAVILY SPAMMED, but the added bonus of such an approach, even 
under heavy spam-flak, is a much more cleano results list than anybody else.<br>
<br>
This said, search engine result quality is of course <font color=blue>ALSO</font> a function of <font color=blue>how the algorithms weight the results</font>. So after 
eliminating dupes and fake URLs you still have to apply sound algos in order to fetch relevant results.

<br><br>
The main reason you should use more than one <a href="main.htm">main</a> search engine is that 
search engines overlap FAR less than you would think. Recent studies (For instance <a target=_top href="http://comparesearchengines.dogpile.com/OverlapAnalysis.pdf">Dogpile, April 2005</a>) 
point out that around 3/4 of the results of a given search are UNIQUE for each search engine.

<br><br>
  So, please, do remember, every-time you pavlovianically use google to search, that
  <font color=blue>each main search engine�s results are largely unique</font>: "Google alone and your search is never done".
<br><br>

<br>Yahoo versus Google<br>
<center>
<i>"My index's bigger than yours, nah, nah, nah, nah"</i><br><br>
</center>
<br>I have prepared these data - that you wont find on the web elsewhere- for this Helsinki conference.
They demonstrate that  -for the <a href="main.htm">main</a> search engines- <font color=blue>index size is only loosely (and peraphs inversely&nbsp;:-) 
related to the quality of results returned</font>
<br>One month ago (August 2005) Yahoo announced suddenly to have indexed 19 Billion (milliards) documents. Clearly an attempt to dwarf Google's famous "8 Billion" (Milliards) sites.
<br>Alas! No wonder that the results of (almost) any test search you may launch keep to be in Google's favor: 
as the following data prove, the biggest increase in Yahoo's results seems to have been in "frills" domains. 
<br>
For instance Yahoo now indexes <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?_adv_prop=web&x=op&ei=UTF-8&fr=FP-tab-web-t&va=%2A&va_vt=any&vp_vt=any&vo_vt=any&ve_vt=any&vd=all&vst=.com&vs=.com&vf=all&vm=i&fl=0&n=10">9.560.000.000</a> 
"com" domain documents, versus the <a target=_top href="http://www.google.com/search?hs=aVp&hl=en&lr=&client=opera&rls=en&as_qdr=all&q=site%3Acom&btnG=Search">1.690.000.000</a> 
indexed by google. As you can see, the most striking differences, when regarding domains, are to be found 
on <font color=blue>crap & frill</font> domains like "com", "info", "net" & "biz".<br>
We can clearly see that the differences are less important for more content-rich domains like "edu", "org", "gov", "mil" and "int".  

<br>
Here some graphs:<br><br>
Note the sad preponderance of ".com" domains among those indexed:

<br><br>
<IMG SRC="images/googledomains1.jpg"
ALT="god image"
ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH="624" HEIGHT="421" BORDER=0 VSPACE=0
HSPACE=0>
<br><br>
Note the <font color=blue>absolute</font> preponderance of those very ".com" domains in Yahoo:<br>
<br>
<IMG SRC="images/yahoodomains1.jpg"
ALT="yado image"
ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH="624" HEIGHT="421" BORDER=0 VSPACE=0
HSPACE=0>
<br><br>
Would anyone in his right mind prefer a search engine that prefers "biz", "info", "net" and "com" domains? <br>
<br>
<IMG SRC="images/difference_yahoo_over_google1.jpg"
ALT="diyago image"
ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH="624" HEIGHT="421" BORDER=0 VSPACE=0
HSPACE=0>
<br><br>
Anyway, as you can see in the following graph, the COVERING of the web (especially taking account 
of the hidden databases) is still rather meager BOTH for 
Yahoo and Google:<br>

<br><hr width=55% align=left><br>
<br>
Hence the importance of using OTHER METHODS to search the web, and not only the <a href="main.htm">main</a> search engines.
Here some hints (more about these techniques tomorrow):<br>
1) go regional, then go regional again<br>
2) go <a href="ftp.htm">FTP</a><br>
3) go <a href="irc.htm">IRC</a><br>
4) go <a href="usenet.htm">USENET</a>/MESSAGEBARDS/<a href="blog.htm">BLOGS</a> (yet remember that blogs are nothing more than messageboards where only the owner can start a thread, 
this being the main reason  -with few exceptions- of their quick obsolescence, short
 duration and scant utility)<br>
5) use <a href="local.htm">homepages/rings/webarchives</a>, cached repositories<br>
6) use <a href="luring.htm">luring</a> & social engineering<br>
7) use  <a href="stalking.htm">stalking</a> & <a href="trolls.htm">trolling</a>

<br><br>
<br>We have already seen various querystrings: some "arrows" useful to find your targets.<br>

To -quickly- fetch your targets, wading through the slimy commercial morasses of the web,
made specifically "ad captandum vulgus", and in order to  "cut" 
all the useless ballast  you need a sword (and a shield).
<br>
<br><center><font size=+3>The Sword</font></center><br>

When you need to "cut" the Web  your arrows, even the best ones,  wont be enough: 
you'll need first of all  a sharp blade: <font color=blue>a capable and quick browser</font>. 
<br><br>
That's the first and foremost 
tool of a seeker. MSIE, Microsoft Internet explorer is a no-no-no, buggy, bloated and prone to all sort of nasty attacks. The 
two current "philosophical  schools" are either Firefox or <a target=_top href="http://opera.com/support/tutorials/tips/">Opera</a>. 

<br><center><font size=+3>The Shield</font></center><br>
Whichever  browser you use, no sword will be enough without a SHIELD. And your shield, 
and a mighty one for that, is <font color=blue>proxomitron</font>. <br>
Proxomitron is a very powerful tool. Its power lies 
in its ability to <font color=blue>rewrite webpages on the fly</font>, <font color=blue>filter communications between 
your computer and the web servers of the sites you visit</font>, and to <font color=blue>allow easy management of external proxy use</font>.<br><br>
Again: Proxomitron works by intercepting the HTML stream your
browser sees, and changes it on the fly. It runs as an "<font color=blue>HTTP Proxy</font>"
meaning it reads the HTML from the web and hands it off to your
browser. Since it lets you edit rules, if you
 know HTML  you will know what you're changing and may
create your own rules.

<br>
Here a 
link to an old, but very good essay about proxomitron basic installation: <a href="anony_8.htm">anony_8.htm</a>, and a link 
to 
another essay, <a href="proxopro_1.html">Oncle Faf goes inside proxomitron</a> about further fine-tuning.... Let's sum it up: 
<i>"Only morons 'just do it' without <a target=_top href="http://www.searchlores.org/zipped/ProxN44.zip">Proxomitron</a>."</i>

<br><br>
Now let's see some of Opera's advantages (the quick browser I  
 mostly use for a plethora of <a href="tuttiope.htm">reasons</a>)... 
 <IMG SRC="images/bulletr.gif" ALT="red" align="bottom" valign="bottom" WIDTH="13"
HEIGHT="13">&nbsp;<br>...
<br><br>
Among the many useful uses of proxomitron, its filters offer more speed to the seeker: as an example let's use proxomitron to nullify the 
time waiting span imposed by <a target=_top href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&c2coff=1&q=rapidshare.de%2Ffiles&btnG=Search">rapidshare</a>.<br>

<a target=_top href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&c2coff=1&q=rapidshare.de%2Ffiles+hacking&btnG=Search">rapidshare.de/files hacking</a> (or,

Alas! Rapidshare, while useful, has a silly commercial attitude with 
an annoying "delaying" trick.<br>
Let's have a look at it,
fetching a book, that could maybe prove  of some interest for 
some of the worthy colleagues that have gathered here today: <br>

<!-- secrecy.ayinfo.ha.cn/jiemi/%B8%FA%D7%D9%B5%F7%CA%D4/NuMega.DriverStudio.v3.0Beta2.rar -->
<br>here is an example of rapidshare 'delaying' javascript code, which  runs on client side:</font>
<pre>
&lt;script>var c = 58; fc(); function fc(){
if(c>0){document.getElementById("dl").innerHTML = "<b>Download-Ticket reserved. Please wait " + c + ' seconds.
<br>Avoid the need for download-tickets by using a <a href="https://searchlores.nickifaulk.com/en/premium.html">PREMIUM-Account</a>. <font color="red">Instant access!</font></b>';
c = c - 5;setTimeout("fc()", 5000)} else {document.getElementById("dl").innerHTML = unescape('
%3C%68%32%3E%3C%66%6F%6E%74%20%63%6F%6C%6F%72%3D%22%23%43%43%30%30%30%30%22%3E%20%44%6F%77%6E%6C%6F%61%64%3A%3C%2F%66%6F%6E
%74%3E%20%3C%61%20%68%72%65%66%3D%22%68%74%74%70%3A%2F%2F%64%6C%31%2E%72%61%70%69%64%73%68%61%72%65%2E%64%65%2F%66%69%6C%65

}}&lt;/script>
</pre><font size=+1>
In this case you would just use following proxo filter (by Loki):
<font color=blue><pre>
Name = "RapidShare"
Active = TRUE
URL = "*rapidshare.de*"
Limit = 256
Match = "(var count?)\1 = [#0:45]"
Replace = "\1 = 0"
</pre></font>

The other limit  of rapidshare, the '<font color=blue>just one download</font>' limit (that I bet some of you have already 
encountered in the past few minutes&nbsp;:-) can of 
course also be circumvented, for instance using <font color=blue>rotating anonymous proxies</font>, a task made easy(<a href="Helsinki_.htm#note_1">*</a>) 
by our good ole <font color=blue>PROXOMITRON</font>. <br>
Alternatively you can flush and request a new IP address:<br>
Start --> run --> cmd.exe --> ipconfig /flushdns --> ipconfig /release --> ipconfig /renew --> exit<br>
Erase your cookies and reconnect to rapidshare.
<br><br>

Note however that the rapidshare search above is JUST ONE EXAMPLE:<br>
Rapidshare is one of many "upload repositories" where people can upload large files. 
It allows unlimited downloads. There are many similar repositories:<br>
<a target=_top href="http://www.rapidshare.de/">rapidshare.de/</a>: 30 Mb max, forever but after 30 days unused the file is removed,  daily download limit of 3,000 MB for hosted files<br>
<a target=_top href="http://www.yousendit.com">YouSendIt</a>: 1 Giga max, after 7 days or 25 downloads (whichever occurs first) 
the file is automatically removed<br>
<a target=_top href="http://www.mytempdir.com/">mytempdir</a>: 25 Mb max, 14 days * 1200 free downloads, after that only from 23.00 to 7.00.<br>
<a target=_top href="http://www.sendmefile.com">Sendmefile</a>: 30 Mb max, after 14 days the file is automatically removed<br>
<a target=_top href="http://www.megaupload.com">Megaupload</a>: 500 Mb max <font color=blue>(!)</font>, forever but after 30 days unused the file is removed (like rapidshare)<br>
<a target=_top href="http://www.qfile.de">qfile.de</a>: unfortunately boughtg by rapidshare and 
closed a few days ago<br>
<a target=_top href="http://www.ultrashare.net/">ultrashare.net/</a>: 30 Mb max, forever but after 30 days unused the file is removed (like rapidshare)<br>

<a target=_top href="http://www.spread-it.com/">http://www.spread-it.com/</a>: 500Mb - Forever or after 14 days if unused<br> 
<a target=_top href="http://turboupload.com/">http://turboupload.com/</a>: 70Mb - download delay in order to show pub<br> 
<a target=_top href="http://www.4shared.com/">http://www.4shared.com/</a>: 100Mb - 10Mb per file Forever or after 30 days if unused<br>

"Over the last several months, publishers 
have begun opposing the <a target=_top href="http://print.google.com/googleprint/about.html">Google Print for Libraries</a> program (http://print.google.com) 
 grumbling litigiously about copyright issues"
</center><br>
<br>

<br>There's a whole section regarding <a href="books.htm">books searching</a> at <a target=_top href="http://www.searchlores.org">searchlores</a>, 
and you can delve into it by yourself. Suffice to say that (almost) all books mankind has written 
are already on the web somewhere, 
and that while we are sitting here dozens of fully scanned <font color=blue>libraries</font> are going on line: 
if you'r attentive enough, 
and if your searching scripts are good, you can 
even hear the clinking "thuds" of those huge databases going on line...  
<IMG SRC="images/bulletr.gif" ALT="red" align="bottom" valign="bottom" WIDTH="13"
HEIGHT="13">&nbsp;<br>

<br><br>First of all a quick "book searching" example:<br>
As usual the problem is <font color=blue>HOW</font> you search. For instance if you search Antoine De Saint-Exup�ry's book "Little Prince" for your kids you shouldn't 
search "little prince", you should search something like 
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hs=T0Q&hl=en&lr=&client=opera&rls=en&q=%22Asteroid+B+612%22+%22little+prince%22&btnG=Search">"Asteroid B 612" 
"little prince"</a> or use a direct longsearch: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=opera&rls=en&q=%22They+have+guns,+and+they+hunt.+It+is+very+disturbing.+They+also+raise+chickens.+These+are+their+only+interests.+Are+you+looking+for+chickens?%22&sourceid=opera&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8">"They have guns, and they hunt. It is very disturbing. They also raise chickens. These are their only interests. 
Are you looking for chickens?"</a> (also on <a href="http://beta.search.msn.com/results.aspx?q=%22They+have+guns%2C+and+they+hunt.+It+is+very+disturbing.+They+also+raise+chickens.+These+are+their+only+interests.+Are+you+looking+for+chickens%3F%22&FORM=QBNO">MSN</a> 
or on <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=%22They+have+guns%2C+and+they+hunt.+It+is+very+disturbing.+They+also+raise+chickens.+These+are+their+only+interests.+Are+you+looking+for+chickens%3F%22">Yahoo</a> 
of course).<br><br>
Now, since this snippet comes from chapter 21 of the Little prince, you just add a <font color=blue>+21</font> and cut even more noise:
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hs=xBR&hl=en&lr=&client=opera&rls=en&q=%2B21+%22They+have+guns%2C+and+they+hunt.+It+is+very+disturbing.+They+also+raise+chickens.+These+are+their+only+interests.+Are+you+looking+for+chickens%3F%22&btnG=Search">+21 
"They have guns, and they hunt. It is very disturbing. They also raise chickens. These are their only interests. Are you looking for chickens?"</a>.
<br><br>
The query is still weak, let's cut the "com" sites out: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hs=Ltl&hl=en&lr=&client=opera&rls=en&as_qdr=all&q=%2B21++%22They+have+guns+and+they+hunt+It+is+very+disturbing+They+also+raise+chickens+These+are+their+only+interests+Are+you+looking+for+chickens%22+-site%3Acom&btnG=Search">+21  "They have guns and they hunt It is very disturbing They also raise chickens These are their only interests Are you looking for chickens" -site:com</a>.
That looks good!


<br><hr width=44%><br>


There are many  huge 
databases of books on the wide web. Private, public, educational or commercial? It is irrelevant for seekers.
In order to fetch your target you just need  some correct strings, i.e.  -as usual- 
some sharp arrows.<br>

A banal, yet useful approach is starting from <a target=_top href="http://a9.com/-/search/advSearch">the powerful A9 engine</a>, 
for instance, for Conan Doyle,
 <a target=_top href="http://a9.com/conan%20doyle?a=obooks">http://a9.com/conan%20doyle?a=obooks</a> 
 and then fetch its own <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0553328255/ref=sib_rdr_next3_ex17/102-1260521-5632156?%5Fencoding=UTF8&p=S00P&ns=1#reader-page">study 
 in scarlet</a>.
 <br>
 Of course once we have <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22He+is+sure+to+be+at+the+laboratory%22+%22returned+my+companion.%22&num=100&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8">some 
 sharper arrows</a>, it is 
 relatively easy to fetch whole copies of a given book onto the web at large...
<br><br>
This is  true for all kind of copyrighted books as well... let's see:
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&c2coff=1&q=%22Suddenly%2C+caught+by+the+level+beams%2C+Frodo+saw+the+old+king%27s+head%22&btnG=Search">"Suddenly, caught by the level beams, Frodo saw the old king's head"</a>...
<br>
and we land here, for instance: <a target=_top href="http://www.angelfire.com/theforce/ring/book4/Chap7b4.html">Suddenly, caught by the level 
beams, Frodo saw the old king's head: it 
was lying rolled away by the roadside. `Look, Sam!' he cried, startled into speech. `Look! The king has got a crown again!'</a> 

<br>
<!--
<br>A typical example of the joys of good web-fishing: 
<a href="ftp://ftp.cdut.edu.cn/pub3/">ftp://ftp.cdut.edu.cn/pub3/</a> let's see if you can imagine, "a ritroso" the querystrings you may 
use to fetch such a site and the "onion peeling" of such an URl you could immediately perform 
 (this kind of 'reversing' approach is 
 a useful seekers' exercise as well).
 <br>
 -->
 <br>
 Finally, try out (and understand) this arrow:<br>
 <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&q=-inurl%3Ahtm+-inurl%3Ahtml+intitle%3A%E2%80%9Dindex+of%E2%80%9D+%2B%28%E2%80%9C%2Febooks%E2%80%9D%7C%E2%80%9D%2Fbook%E2%80%9D%29+%2B%28chm%7Cpdf%7Czip%29+%2B%E2%80%9DFor+Dummies%E2%80%9D&btnG=Search">-inurl:htm 
 -inurl:html intitle:�index of� +(�/ebooks�|�/book�) +(chm|pdf|zip) +�For Dummies�</a>
 <br><br>
 or maybe you prefer this one?<br>
 <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&q=-inurl%3Ahtm+-inurl%3Ahtml+intitle%3A%22index+of%22+%2B%28%22%2Febooks%22%7C%22%2Fbook%22%29+%2B%28chm%7Cpdf%7Czip%29+%2B%22o%27reilly%22&btnG=Search">-inurl:htm -inurl:html intitle:"index of" +("/ebooks"|"/book") +(chm|pdf|zip) +"o'reilly"</a>
 
<br><br>
(anyway at the moment with books even <a target=_top href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&q=%22index+of%22+oreilly&btnG=Search">banal arrows</a> 
will deliver whatever you want)

<br>"<i>The contradictions of journal searching</i>"<br></u></font>  
<br>
</center>
Now, let's imagine we need a given COMPLETE ARTICLE, not an abstract, a complete text, and we do not want to pay no clowns for that. 
Let's imagine we want 
something mathematic related, I haven chosen as examples ["<font color=blue>polynomial</font>"] and ["<font color=blue>prime factorization</font>"]
<br><br>
Most searchers would use the two most "common" search engines for MATHEMATIC-RELATED articles 
 of the visible web: 
<a target=_top href="http://www.emis.de/ZMATH/">http://www.emis.de/ZMATH/</a>, which you can use to start a search and  
<a target=_top href="http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/search">http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/search</a> which you SHOULD NOT use, due to its commercial crappiness<br>
Let's search for "polynomial" <IMG SRC="images/bulletr.gif" ALT="red" align="bottom" valign="bottom" WIDTH="13"
HEIGHT="13">&nbsp;<br>
Let's imagine we are interested in the 
third result: "<font color=blue>The minimum period of the Ehrhart quasi-polynomial of a rational polytope</font>", alas! Now we would be 
supposed "to pay" in order to consult/see/download it. <br>But we'r seekers, right?<br>
Let's use <font color=blue>a part of the abstract</font> in order to fetch our target <i>in extenso</i>: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=opera&rls=en&q=%22+called+the+Ehrhart+quasi-polynomial+of%22&sourceid=opera&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8">" called the Ehrhart quasi-polynomial of"</a>...
see? Let's repeat this with any other article on this database... <IMG SRC="images/bulletr.gif" ALT="red" align="bottom" valign="bottom" WIDTH="13"
HEIGHT="13">&nbsp;
<br><br>
Of course we could also have used <a target=_top href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&lr=&q=%22prime+factorization%22&btnG=Search">google scholar</a>
<br><br>So, we have seen how to bypass  commercial yokes using the previously explained "long string searching" approach. <br><br>
The funny thing is that the web is so deep that we <font color=blue>do not need at all</font> to go through such bazaars.<br><br>

In fact the "open source" waves are already purifying the closed world of the scientific journals as well. Good riddance!
<br><br>
Let's search on <a target=_top href="http://www.arxiv.org/multi?group=math&%2Ffind=Search">The Front</a> (arxiv.org), that 
is slowly beating the euroamerican commercial bastards black and blue...  
for instance: <a target=_top href="http://search.arxiv.org:8081/?query=%22prime+factorization%22&in=math">"prime factorization"</a>, 
but, to keep our previous example, also: "<font color=blue>The minimum period of the Ehrhart</font>"... et voil�.

<br>
On one side the idiots that do not even let you search if yo do not pay up front (US-mathscinet) & the clowns that let you search, but then 
want you to pay in order to fetch your results (EU-ZMATH)... even if we could still find as seekers our targets, it 
is refreshing to know that there is, on the other side, coesisting on teh same web with the previous wankers, a complete search engine, with a 
better more rapidly growing database and everything you need for free <i>hic et nunc</i>(the Front: "It freed anyone from the need to be in Princeton, Heidelberg or Paris in order to do frontier research"). 
So, once again, the web, our web is BOTH a bottomless cornucopia and an immense 
commercial infested garbage damp, and -of course- you need to know how to search...

<br><br>
We have seen how easy it is to find books, music, images, software and documents on the web.

<br><br>
This is quite interesting, because it basically means that
the guardian of the light tower, the young kid in central africa and the yuppie in new york all have access to the 
same resources: location is now irrelevant... <IMG SRC="images/bulletr.gif" ALT="red" align="bottom" valign="bottom" WIDTH="13"

Developments</font></center>

<br><br>
In the year 2000 the first flash memory cards had 256 Mb (10^6) chips. The most recent ones (NAND usb types memory) 
have  now reached, 
just six years later, <font color=blue>16 Gigabytes</font> (10^9) (and Samsung said that new flash cards 
up to 32 Gigabytes are 
expected already in 2006). The capacity has been doubled every year. 
<br><br>
D'you remember the rice and the chessboard tale? 
There are 64 squares on a chess board. If you double a chip of flash 64 times
you end up with more storagespace than there is in all of the universe&nbsp;:-)
<br>
Such a  development means many things (inter alia that static is the way to go and that, hence, 
harddisks and mobile storage devices � la DVDs are as dead as a Dodo)  
 it means -speaking storage- that with 16.000.000.000 bytes 
 you can have  already now <font color=blue>something like 16000/2 perfect mp3s</font> 
 or <font color=blue>16*2 dvd hours of movies</font> on a single flash memory, and this development 
 also means that you will have in 5 years time 
<font color=blue>as many terabytes as you like</font>: the web in your pockets, 
all the books of the world in your PDA. And what does it means  for seekers?
It means that searching and evaluation techniques, both on the wide web and inside 
your own repositories 
will be more and more important.
<br><br><center><font color=blue size=+2>
Evaluation</font></center>

Hence:
The paramount importance of evaluation... <IMG SRC="images/bulletr.gif" ALT="red" align="bottom" valign="bottom" WIDTH="13"
HEIGHT="13">&nbsp;
<br>
Learning to discern CRAP and 
learning to reverse advertisers' tricks 
 will be MORE and MORE important.
<br><br>
Your capacity of not being fooled, of understanding the rhetorical
tricks will be PARAMOUNT (even more than now... "scusate se � poco")
<br><br>
<font size=+1><font color=blue>Your capacity to choose: in life and on the web.</font></font>
<br><br>
The correct (useful, lasting) cloth or textile, the correct (tasty,
lasting) pear fruit, the correct (enlightening, lasting) book to
read,
the correct (involving, lasting) game to play.  The common word for these physical things is probably that
LASTING adjective. And this will -I believe- be even more valid for 
the web in your pocket in a few years, with all its terabytes of moving virtual quicksand.
<br><br>
So which conclusions? 
<br>STFW!
<br><br>
That's it.<br>
Any questions?

This talk should help to "concretize" a little what we have seen together yesterday.<br>
Let's begin with one of the "simple searching rules" we have seen yesterday<br>
<center><font size=+2>Go <a href="regional.htm">regional</a>!</font></center>

<br><br>

This can be fairly simple most of the time... 
for instance a typical "science database" search could begin using ad hoc operators:
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hs=C2d&hl=en&lr=&client=opera&rls=en&q=intitle%3Asearch+intitle%3Ascience+site%3Auk&btnG=Search">intitle:search intitle:science site:uk</a>
<br><br>

In german such eine search would be something like <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=opera&rls=en&q=intitle:suchen+intitle:wissenschaft+site:de&sourceid=opera&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8">intitle:suchen intitle:wissenschaft site:de</a>
<br><br>
And in french: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&hl=en&lr=&client=opera&rls=en&as_qdr=all&q=intitle%3Arecherche++intitle%3Ascience+site%3Aca+%7C+site%3Abe+%7C+site%3Afr&btnG=Search">intitle:recherche  intitle:science site:ca | site:be | site:fr</a>
<br><br>However, this is not always so simple: 
How would you translate a search like
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=opera&rls=en&q=astronomy+intitle:dictionary+OR+intitle:glossary+OR+intitle:lexicon&sourceid=opera&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8">astronomy intitle:dictionary OR intitle:glossary OR intitle:lexicon</a>

<br><br>
Hence, going regional is simpler said than done if you do not know many languages. 


So let's make it simpler done than said&nbsp;:-)<br><br>
<center><font size=+2 color=blue>How to find useful searchstrings in (almost) any language<br></font>by +fravia, Sommer 2005</center>
<br><br></font>
(The following masks and appletts have been copyrighted by me under the <a target=_top href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.txt">GPL</a> licence)
<font size=+1><br>
First of all let's find an interesting string in any of the following languages:<font color=blue>
en, fr, de, it, nl, es, el, pt, sv, da, fi, cs, et, lv, lt, hu, mt, pl, sk, sl</font><br> using the following search mask:
<BR>

<FORM name=f accept-charset=UTF-8 action=http://www.google.com/search><!-- MODIFIED on 21 JUNE 2005 --><INPUT 
type=hidden name=lr> <INPUT type=hidden value=100 name=num> <INPUT type=hidden 
value=UTF-8 name=ie> <!-- input type=hidden name=hl value="en"--><INPUT 
type=hidden value=0 name=filter> <INPUT type=hidden value=i name=as_dt> <INPUT 
type=hidden value=eu.int name=as_sitesearch> <INPUT maxLength=2048 size=77 
name=q> <BR><INPUT type=submit value="Goog-EU Search" name=btnG> <INPUT type=submit value="I'm Feeling Lucky" name=btnI> 
</FORM></TD></TR></TABLE><br>
Yes, this is a mask used to retrieve EU-documents. You just input a (possibly long) searchstring <font color=blue>in any of the EU 20 
languages</font> and  then fetch quickly your results from ALL eu.int servers (or from google's cached copies if those servers 
are too slow).
<BR><br>
The EU has given public access to (almost) all its documents on line. This for searchers is of incredible importance: it opens the 
path to BILLIONS of interrelated documents in 20 different european languages (and counting: <font color=blue>ro</font> and <font color=blue>bg</font> should be added soon) that 
have been translated by HUMANS. So this is no machine translation, as you will see.
<br><br>
Note that the mask above doesn't simply add "<font color=blue>site:eu.int</font>" to your google searches, <BR>It also gives back 
100 (instead of the default 10) results per 
page and guarantees that no results regrouping algos will be applied.<BR>Another 
filter imposes the UTF-8 charset (most <FONT color=blue>accented 
characters</FONT> are thus allowed) <BR> 
<br><br>
Let's try a search for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?lr=&num=100&ie=UTF-8&filter=0&as_dt=i&as_sitesearch=eu.int&q=dictionary+glossary+lexicon&btnG=Goog-EU+Search">dictionary glossary lexicon site:eu.int</a>, 
terms which can aways come quite handy.
<br><br>
Let's open this "<a target=_top href="http://www.eionet.eu.int/gemet/concept?cp=4785">lexicon</a>" entry and bang! Automagically we get 
a lot of useful arrows... and if we click on "document types", even more arrows...
<br><br>
Of course, alternatively, you could also use 
the now abandoned but still useful <a target=_top href="http://europa.eu.int/eurodicautom/Controller">eurodicautom</a> and search for<br>
<font color=blue>dictionary lexicon glossary</font><br>

<br><br>
But the real utility of the form above (and of the bookmarklets below) is in finding LONG HUMAN TRANSLATED SENTENCES, not dictionary entries.
<br><br>

Let's try the search <a href="http://www.google.com/search?lr=&num=100&ie=UTF-8&filter=0&as_dt=i&as_sitesearch=eu.int&q=%22strategy+for+information+and+communication%22&btnG=Goog-EU+Search">
"strategy for information and communication"</a><br><br>
As you can see most results come from the europa server and from the server of the EP.<br>
Let's click (it's just an example) onto <a target=_top href="http://www2.europarl.eu.int/omk/sipade2?PUBREF=-//EP//TEXT+TA+P6-TA-2005-0102+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN&LEVEL=3&NAV=X">P6_TA-PROV(2005)0102</a> 
and we will see the 
snippet "<font color=blue> to develop and strengthen the Agency's strategy for information and communication</font>".
<br>
Now we could just change "<font color=blue>en</font>" in the URL of the previous document to "<font color=blue>fi</font>" and 
<a target=_top href="http://www2.europarl.eu.int/omk/sipade2?PUBREF=-//EP//TEXT+TA+P6-TA-2005-0102+0+DOC+XML+V0//FI&LEVEL=3&NAV=X">obtain the same document in finn</a> (o in any other 
of the 20 languages), or we could use the following bookmarklet (devised by -ritz) that, being a bookmarklet, allows us to open a different document 
starting from another document <font color=blue>CLIENT-SIDE</font> (btw, the deep security implications of this 
kind of bookmarklets will, I hope, 
be noticed by this audience :-)
<br><br>Here 
 the 
<a href='javascript:d=document;e=d.URL;e=e.replace(/search\?q=cache:.*?:/gi,"search?q=cache:");l=prompt("please enter the languagecode","");i=e.replace(/([^a-zA-Z])en([^a-zA-Z])/g,"$1"+l.toLowerCase()+"$2");i=i.replace(/([^a-zA-Z])EN([^a-zA-Z])/g,"$1"+l.toUpperCase()+"$2");if(l){d.write("<html><body><object data=\""+e+"\" id=\"left\" width=\"49%\" height=\"200000px\">error</object> <object data=\""+i+"\" id=\"right\" width=\"50%\" height=\"200000px\">error</object></body></html>");}else{void(0);}'>

different bookmarklets:

<a href="dictiona.htm">Languages</a> knowledge is on the web of paramount importance. 
Our 
"english mothertongues" friends mostly underestimate this aspect. As we have seen, one of the 
best ways to bypass the limitations of the main search engines is going local, 
through multilinguism. As you can imagine, whole new 
constellations of interesting targets can be accessed through -say-  russian, chinese, arabic, 
japanese and korean search engines.<br> 
I will make an example related to these latter.
<br><br>A seeker should know  that <a href="http://www.naver.com/">naver</a>, 
<a href="http://www.chol.com/">chol</a>, 
<a href="http://www.daum.net/">daum</a> (powered by <a href="http://www.google.com/">google</a>), 
<a href="http://www.empas.com/">empas</a> (which automatically searches for images) 
and <a href="http://www.ready.co.kr/">ready</a> (powered by <a href="http://www.wisenut.com/">wisenut</a>)
are the main korean search engines.
<br><br>
There is of course also a 
<a href="http://kr.yahoo.com/">korean yahoo</a>, a 
<a href="http://search.msn.co.kr/category.aspx">korean msn</a>, and a
<a href="http://www.google.co.kr/">korean google</a> (this howeverer will give you the same results as 
"any" google unless you specify in the URL <font color=blue>&lr=lang_ko</font>).
<br><br>
The interesting thing is that <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&hl=en&lr=&c2coff=1&client=opera&rls=en&q=naver+chol+daum+empas++%22search+engines%22+-%22direct+request%22+-weblog+-%22usage+statistics%22+-referring&btnG=Search">using 
these very names</a> you get a query that bypasses the SEOs' spam inside the results you would have 
using a more obvious, but <font color=blue>for this reason</font> spammed, string: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&hl=en&lr=&c2coff=1&client=opera&rls=en&q=korean+search+engines&btnG=Search">korean search engines</a>

<br><br>
There's a whole 'linguistic' section <a href="dictiona.htm">on line at searchlores</a>...
<IMG SRC="images/bulletr.gif" ALT="red" align="bottom" valign="bottom" WIDTH="13"

<br><br>

  As an example of how powerful some on-line services can be  
  have for example a look at the following tool, something that you may use to understand a Japanese site:
  <br><br>
 <font color=blue size=+2>RIKAI</font><br>
An incredible jappo-english translator!<br> 
<a target=_top href="http://www.rikai.com/perl/Home.pl">http://www.rikai.com/perl/Home.pl</a>
<br>Try it for instance onto http://www.shirofan.com/ See? It   "massages" WWW pages and
 places "popup translations" from the EDICT database behind the Japanese text!
<br><br>

for instance<br>
http://www.rikai.com/perl/LangMediator.En.pl?mediate_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.shirofan.com%2F

<br>See?<br>
   You can use this tool to "guess" the meaning of many a japanese page or -and especially- japanese search engine options, 
   even if you do not know Japanese :-)<br>
   You can easily understand how, in this way, you can -with the proper tools- explore the wealth of results that the 
   japanese, chinese, korean... you name them... search engines may (and probably will) give you.
    <br><br>
    Let's search for "<a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&hs=FLj&hl=en&lr=&c2coff=1&client=opera&rls=en&q=%22Spanish+Search+Engines%22&btnG=Search">spanish

    hispanos</a>"... see?
    <br><br>
    And you can have useful results even when the alphabet is different: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=opera&rls=en&q=Poiskovaya+Mashina&sourceid=opera&num=100&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8">Poiskovaya Mashina</a>

<br><center><font size=+3>How to discover whois on-line</font></center><br>


<br>For instance, using the previous example:

<br>

Whois reversing is important in general and can give you even cheap satisfactions in your 
battles against spam <font color=blue>because it usally allows some level of retaliation against email-spammers</font>.<br>
How?
Easy: check your email-spam, find <font color=blue>the site</font> they want you to visit through the spam (they wont put any valid email address 
inside the spam, of course) and then slowbomb<IMG SRC="images/bulletr.gif" ALT="red" align="bottom" valign="bottom" WIDTH="13"
HEIGHT="13">&nbsp;<br>.... the responsibles.

<br><br>As an example, the most recent spam nuked in my 
dev/null folder, redirected  readers to the clowns at
<a target=_top href="http://www.optinemailtoday.biz/">http://www.optinemailtoday.biz/</a>.
<br>
If you check the site through  whois <a target=_top href="http://www.whois.sc/optinemailtoday.biz">http://www.whois.sc/optinemailtoday.biz</a><br> 
you'll find that this domain has just a PO box in Seattle, but <font color=blue>also</font> that their billing contact is 
<font color=blue>bsoloway@inorbit.com</font><br>
A short search will dig out <a target=_top href="http://www.mortgagespam.com/soloway/">these documents</a> and demonstrate that this is a  well known  spammer: 
<a target=_top href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_e-mail_spammers">Robert Alan Soloway</a>, operating in Seattle, Washington State, with his clown company "Network Internet Marketing", 
1200 Western Ave, APT. 17-E, Seattle WA 98101, with the 
work address nim@cyberservices.com... that you can 
 slowbomb <br> 
<br>
Slowbomb him to hell, and slowbomb <font color=blue>inorbit.com</font>'s 
email-addresses and kristin@hlglaw.com (an attorney that defended this spammer) as well for good measure&nbsp;:-)

MMS?

</i><br><br>
</center>



<br><br>

The web has enhanced the importance of text. <br><br>
A small digression about captchas<br><br>
And of defeating text:<br>
In many sites  rotated or deformed images of text are being used to deter automatic bots from <a target=_top href="http://www.brains-n-brawn.com/default.aspx?vDir=aicaptcha">posting comment spam</a>
Such text snippets, often on textured background, are called <a target=_top href="http://www.captcha.net/">captchas</a> ("Completely Automated Public Turing test to Tell Computers and Humans Apart") and can 
be (often) <a target=_top href="http://sam.zoy.org/pwntcha/">quite easily defeated</a>. 
More <a target=_top href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~mori/gimpy/gimpy.html">here</a>

<br><br>
Some lessons can be learned from the incredible development of SMS and the 
historical flop (at least in Europe) of those heavily pushed MMS: people are not stupid. Content is more important than frills. Text rules, 
despite  the wide availability of useless) camera phones.
<br><br>
Three years after the introduction of picture messaging in Europe, 
MMS is still a flop. Network operators still gain 99 per cent of their data revenue from plain old text messaging.
MMS images are -simply put- NOT printable: too low (by far) resolutions. People don't do anything with the few) images they may
have taken. By default many phones send 30kb images in SMS, you need TEN times that to have something barely printable.
<br><br>
Multimedia Messaging Services has been the biggest flop since WAP  ("Worthless Application Protocol" or  "Wait And Pay"). MMS should be free, 
and it costs twice the price of a postcard. Add to this the roaming costs, and you are sure no-one in his right mind will use it.
So what? Zombies rule. No-one in his right mind would print in colors, but it is next to impossible to find a only black and white printer... <IMG SRC="../images/bulletr.gif" ALT="red" align="bottom" valign="bottom" WIDTH="13"

A small digression about gameboys (valid also for all other scam-consoles).
<br>
Anyone here with kids has been confronted with the peer pressure, in schools, to buy those useless consoles, which have a next to free 
hardware "to lock the young slave in" and very expensive software (cartridges) to keep the money rolling aplenty from the slave's parents pockets.<br>
A possible solution is to give your kids an old pc of yours, mount on it some good emulators (for instance, 
for gameboy, <font color=blue>VisualBoyAdvance-1.8.0-beta2.zip</font> if I am not mistaken :-) and then search and find ALL POSSIBLE ROMs on the web.
<br><br>
Now let's find the software from the web... <IMG SRC="../images/bulletr.gif" ALT="red" align="bottom" valign="bottom" WIDTH="13"

Before beginning the next snippet, about streaming, we would like to 
show how to operate in a totally legal (sortof) way.
<br>
<a href="file://localhost/H:/05_2005/iradio_setup.exe">iradio_setup.exe</a>

(or maybe here: <a href="file://localhost/D:/conferences/iradio_setup.exe">iradio_setup.exe</a>
: <a target=_top href="http://www.3alab.com/iradio.shtml">iradio</a> is a 
internet radio grabber and ripper, a useful, but alas commercial, program that will allow anybody
to intercept and register on the fly any broadcasted mp3. It is therefore <i>eo ipso</i> a good anti-streaming tool.
<br><br>
Its protection routines are ludicrous, suffice to say that if you disassemble it 
you'll find even the following inside its code: <br>
"D:\Jobs\3alab\RadioGrab\src\protection\.\ASProtection\lc.h"<br>Where we can see inter alia that the original name was probbably "RadioGrab".<br>
but I wont go into its protection routines now, I just wish to demonstrate 
"how to nuke a EULA", you know those END-USER-AGREEMENT-LICENSES that nobody reads when clicking 
onto install files, even if -for all you know- they may impose you to sacrifice your first-born to their gods. 
<br>Apart prohibiting disassembly, a sin I cannot condone, IRADIO's
EULA carries  the following surreal mumbo-jumbo:<pre>All title and intellectual property 
rights in and to the content that may be accessed 
through use of this SOFTWARE PRODUCT remains the property of 
the respective content owner and is protected by 
applicable copyright or other intellectual property 
laws and treaties. This EULA grants you no rights to 
use such content. </pre>
Now, we cannot accept this, because, to be frank with you, the very reason we might want to 
install this anti-streaming grabber on our laptop is to 
grab music that may happen to be patented&nbsp;:-)<br><br>
So we not only disagree, we STRONGLY disagree and do not accept this eula.<br><br>

So let's fire our <A href="zipped/customiz.zip">customizer</a>, 
and let's "strongly disagree" to this EULA before installing iradio...

size=+3>FFF: The music contradiction</font></center></td></tr></table><br><i>Rebuking streamers and censors</i> <br>(Small pirates and fat corporate scammers)
<br><br>
</center>
<br>

Since every music snippet you may even wish, from classic to jazz, is already on the web 
(easy to find through simple search strings, for instance: 
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&client=opera&rls=en&q=intitle%3A%22index+of%2F%22+%22last+modified%22+%22mp3%22+lady+madonna&btnG=Search">intitle:"index of/" "last modified" "mp3" lady madonna</a>, 
albeit this ease is INVERSELY PROPORTIONAL to the 'popularity' of your target) 
noone having more cerebral matter than aubergines 
is buying music anymore.<br>
Sales are de facto broken (-33% in the last 4 years) and the big music monopoles are going berserk.
<br>
Streaming music (encrypted or through obfuscated formats) is one of the many confuse answers they 
have devised.
<br>
Of course 'new' formats can be reersed and encrypted streams must be decrypted with a 
key (hidden) on the consumer's computer, so these measures are ludicrous.
<br>
They may soon try to make it 'illegal' to record a stream through patents, but since 
it was illegal in the first time to download pirated music, and noone cares, their chances 
of success are nil. Just to make you an example, <a target=_top href="http://www.baidu.com">Baidu</a> and Netease (<a target=_top href="http://www.163.com/">http://www.163.com</a>),  two huge chinese search engines/portals, 
have recently stopped, under american corporate pressure, their MP3 search functions.<br>
<br>
Yet there are around 10.000 sites offering pirated music in China alone, and, knowing how to search, anyone can 
bypass such chinese censorship as easy as when using google or the various other 'first wold' censored portals.
<br><br>
For instance using the -not yet censored- querystring 
<font color=blue>m4a "Server at"</font> on Netease: 

<a target=_top href="http://cha.so.163.com/so.php?q=m4a+%22Server+at%22&in=page&c=26">m4a "Server at"</a>
<br>
or this slight variant of the now censored "index of" trick, at Baidu: <a target=_top href="http://www.baidu.com/s?ie=gb2312&bs=ma4+%22Port+80%22&sr=&z=&wd=mp3+%22Port+80%22&ct=0&cl=3&f=8">mp3 "Port 80"</a>
<br>
(for instance: <a target=_top href="http://www.baidu.com/s?ie=gb2312&bs=mp3+%22Port+80%22+dylan&sr=&z=&wd=mp3+%22Port+80%22+eminem&ct=0&cl=3&f=8">mp3 "Port 80" eminem</a>).
<br>

<br>
So we are now, first, examining how to find normal, "non streamed" music. Blogs, those almost 
useless and mostly  boring and (deservedly) short-lived messageboards where only the owner can start a thread, can be for once useful: 
 a completely new wave of music searching is due to the relatively recent 
<a href="musicblogs.htm">mp3 blogs</a> phenomenon. this said  its mostly a waste of time to visit blogs: 
usually it is MUCH  simpler to just fetch the music you 
need from huge web repositories and easy to bypass commercial databases any time you fancy it.
<br><br>
<font color=red>FFF</font>: Let's quickly see some examples:
<br><br>
A simple music searching approach (using as before <font color=blue>m4a</font>s, that are less censored than <font color=blue>mp3</font>s):<br>
<a target=_top href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&q=%28ma4+OR+mp3%29+%22index+of%22+%2Bgarfunkel&btnG=Search">(ma4 OR mp3) "index of" +garfunkel</a>
For instance:<br>
<a target=_top href="http://violentnation.com/fipilele/">http://violentnation.com/fipilele/</a>
<br>
And you'll also land inside this  huge mp3 pasture,  so big that it may crash evena mighty browser (try it with firefox and it will 
probably grind)...
<br>
<a target=_top href="http://24.91.184.80/jserver/files/music/">http://24.91.184.80/jserver/files/music/</a>

<br><br>
A more complex mp3 "klebing" webbit:<br>
<a target=_top href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&as_qdr=all&q=allintext%3A+ma4+OR+mp3+OR+ogg+%22icons%2Fsound2+gif%22&btnG=Search">
allintext: ma4 OR mp3 OR ogg "icons/sound2 gif"</a><br>
See?  Now you'll have to "peel the URL-onions", backwards, towards the correct targets.
<br><br>
Of course another useful approach would be to use <a href="ftp.htm">any ad hoc ftp search engine</a>
<br>
<br>
<br><center><font size=+3>The streaming scam</font></center>
<br>
<br>
More and more music snippets (and videos) are STREAMED on the web. While there are <a href="Helsinki_.htm#note_4">very simple</a> ways to 
defeat any streaming protections, 
 some good anti-streaming tools are a <i>sine qua non</i> on anyone's box. 
 <br><br>
 In fact, due to the mp3 mass-histerya censorship,  finding your music targets streamed on the web is �
 nowadays even more easier than finding them inside some mp3 repositories.
 <br><br>
Fittingly -I believe- for a security conference, I will  show you today  how to reverse two such tools: a general connections checker and 
a streams downloader.
<br><br>
To individuate what exactly is going on during your seeking connections, without tedious studying of your ethereal or firewall 
loggings, 
you may choose to use a small <font color=blue>traffic checker</font> called <a href="tools.htm#ppt">ipticker</a>:  
 a very useful tool, small, not intrusive, powerful. 
 <br>
Ipticker is  useful in order to check  connections and  TCP/UDP data, hence 
you can use it to check suspicious activities (for instance when visiting rogue web sites), and <font color=blue>you can use it also to 
quickly gather the real URL of all streamed files</font>.<br>
You can download <a target=_top href="http://www.searchlores.org/zipped/ipticker.zip">here</a> the old (and uncracked) 
version 1.6. of ipticker.  
<a target=_top href="http://www.soft-trek.com.au/prjIPTicker.asp">They are at version 1.9</a> 
now, so I hope they'll be grateful for this kinda 'advertisement' of their (good) software and 
pardon me the following look under the hood.
<br><br>This older version of Ipticker  was indeed *very badly* protected:
A quick grep for "U N R E G I S T E R E D   V E R S I O N" will land us smack inside the following 
 useless "protection" routine (archaic, I know, but this is a talk for bourgeoises, 
 real crackers in the audience should please refrain from laughing). Only four instructions need a comment.</font>
<pre>
:4039BE E833DFFFFF    call 4018F6	; --> do incredibly complex calculations on the registration key
:4039C3 85C0          test eax, eax	; --> test result of incredibly complex calculations. Al=0?
:4039C5 <font color=red>75</font>12          jne 4039D9	; --> No: jne "good guy"    	
:4039C7 6824D34000    push 40D324    	; --> Yes: push "U N R E G I S T E R E D   V E R S I O N" and flag "bad guy" 
</pre><font size=+1>
Should somebody want to be a "good guy" he may just 
modify the ONE byte in red above, 
turning that "jump if not equal" into 
a "jump if equal" (<a target=_top href="http://www.unixwiz.net/techtips/x86-jumps.html">74</a>) instruction... 

<br><br>

In order to "automate" the stream downloading itself, a
 very useful program is <font color=blue>STREAMDOWN</font>,  a <font color=blue>streaming media download tool</font>. It supports not 
only HTTP and FTP download, but also most streaming media download protocols, such as RTSP, 
MMS, MMSU, MMST. It also supports download resuming. 
You can download Windows Media Streams (.ASF, .ASX, .WAX, .WMA, .WMV), Real Video/Audio Streams (.RM, .RAM, .SMIL) and/or .MP3<br> 
It is a useful program to counter 
those clowns that happily stream music and films in order to avoid 
people making copies of it (even legitimates copies for personal use), 
but its registration routine is another classical example of <font color=blue>a completely useless protection scheme</font>, hence maybe of some 
interest for this audience.<br>
Here I present the older
 <a target=_top href="http://www.searchlores.org/zipped/StreamDown33.zip">version 3.3</a> of streamdown, 
 <a target=_top href="http://www.cocsoft.com/">they are now at version 5.0</a>, so I hope they'll be grateful 
 for this kinda 'advertisement'of their (good) software and 
pardon me the following look under the hood.
<br>
A quick grep for "regcode" (or for "unregistered version") will land us smack inside this 
 "protection" snippet of the code (archaic stuff nowadays! Don't laugh please, software is still "protected" this way).<br>
I have shortened the code for quicker comprehension:</font>

<br><br>Cracking is anyway useless if you know how to search: 
it wouldn't for instance be difficult to find a ready made crack for 
this software (or for anything else). For instance:<br><center>

{popl=51} {mtch=36} crack streamdown</a></center><br>Note that you may even use any ad hoc, non porn infested,   
<a target=_top href="http://www.astakiller.com/?srch=streamdown">crack search engine</a>.
<br>
But using ready made cracks is not elegant and hence "deprecated": 
you should always crack your own software by yourself&nbsp;:-)
<br><br>
<br><br>   
With streamdown and iradiob (plus ipticker), you'll be able to tackle all common kinds of stream.
And whenever you need some specific music, once again, just fetch it from the web at once.<br>
Using a simple string<br>

Frill oriented search engines: MSN=WORST, GOOGLE=BEST<br> We have chosen as reference  the following four terms: "<font color=blue>spears</font>" as "total crap frill" term, "<font color=blue>clinton</font>" 
as "frilly news" term, "<font color=blue>schopenhauer</font>" as "content" term and <font color=blue>myself</font> as "weirdo/freak/marge" term.
Note how the WORST engine is MSN and the best is Google.
Comparing spears versus clinton (frill versus -frilly- news), Comparing spears versus schopenhauer (frill versus content) and 
comparing spears versus fravia (frill versus freak).<br>
Also notice how MSN is THE ONLY main search engine that has even more (as a matter of fact: twice) occurrences for "spears"  than for "clinton".

In order to prepare your own "magic" tricks, and enter where you'r not supposed to (which is the "raison d'�tre" of the real seeker)
you'll have to know the most common scripts used on the web.
<br><br>
This is quite rewarding, but you'll have to "dirty your hands" with some commercial fetid scripts. Knowing their putrid php code can be *quite* 
useful in order to reverse the helluja out of it when we encounter them in our wanderings.
<br><br>
Database scripts are -per definition- easy to retrieve, 
 here a small list
of the most easy to find on the web. They have been released long ago inside a package, 
so I feel free <a target=_top href=" http://rapidshare.de/files/1532439/34Scripts.rar.html">to point to it</a>, 
since 
anyone and his dog <a target=_top href="http://www.programet.com/programs/ebooks/34Scripts.rar">already fetched and used
 them long ago</a>&nbsp;:-)<br>

Most of these scripts are in <a target=_top href="http://fravia.2113.ch/phplab/phplab.htm">php</a>, and really easy to reverse for penetration purposes. 
Many more, different (and more clever)  
ones, 
are on the web alla round you. Go, fish, retrieve and multiply&nbsp;:-)

The simpliest  way is just to take a cable and to plug the output back to the input socket.
<br>
Take a look at the back of your PC. Hopefully you are seeing the socket holes of your soundcard. One of them is surely an output 
( for your headphones ), one of them is input ( from a microphone? ). Most times they both 
works with 3.5mm plugs. So if you have a cable with 3.5mm plugs in both sides 
you can loop back the music ( or whatever output ) to the soundcard/PC. 
<br>

<br>However, this is not that simple:
<br>you got to carefully mute any other sound output apart the WAVE out, then 
<br>in recording mute anything but the LINE IN.
<br>then use a decent program like WAVELAB, and in wavelab set the rec level carefully to avoid noise or distortion.
<br>
the quality will be inferior compared to recording the digital stream since in any case 
you record analog sound which was passed thru the AD/DA converter (which usually sucks unless you 
own a very costly audio card). 
<br>
<br>

however, in the majority of the cases all you need is just to open WAVELAB and just record the WAVE OUT mix : 
<br>you create a new track, press REC and select Wave Out as INPUT, you'll see the spectrogram moving etc, then when 
finished cut the recording and save it as wav or mp3 et voila'.
<br>
<br>doing this you just record the digital stream and NOT the analog i/o, so the only downturn 
is that this stream is a frequency conversion but you'll hardly hear any difference from the original.
<br>
