grasping" is all the rage nowadays, and more and more dirty tricks are
used to force 
you to look at completely useless banners and idiotical 
advertisements that noone in his right mind would click onto. Why this 
actually happens beats me: in my experience and world, in order to find 
the sort of 
people that would really eventually click onto one of these banners you 
would have to visit a center 
for mentally handicapped in their terminal phase. Maybe I'm wrong, 
though, and in the real "Guinea Pigs" world that the advertisers dream 
of, there really exist hundred thousands of slaves who happily click on 
any commercial abomination they see and then - drooling for pleasure - 
buy the crap they deserve. I doubt it, though.<br>Anyway it is our holy

 Ads are sneaking more and more inside your computer. Even if you pay 
for  
a
program, its conceptors now don't hesitate to forward advertisement you 
NEVER WANTED 
to you. The money  
they
get from their applications is not enough: they need you to click on  
their
"big bucks" banners.

Almost everybody knows this application, it's an easy to use "meta 
search bot" that  
uses the 
most current search engines to perform your search. It's one of the most 
used, therefore, 
similar to what Micro$oft does, they (try to) use  
an almost 
monopolistic situation with the aim to transform your computer into a 
mall.<br>Without  
asking you
if they are authorised to.<br><br>
Just try this : download the copernic 2000 pro version 4.55 Use a 
regular, non 
burned serial (a lot of keygens exists), at first launch, it shows no 
ads and 
everything is working fine. But this tool is auto updating to have the 
last links 
to search engines, and when it does, it shows you at the next search 
beautiful 
banners at the top of your screen... Of course&nbsp; you can't disable 
the ads 
: tools,options,uncheck display ads while searching and you've got the 
opportunity 
to buy the program.<br>
Of course it is possible to  
destroy all this devious - and *illegal* - activity, and since you 
should 
have the right
to control what happens inside your pc, I will show how to perform an 
easy  
crack. <br><br>

     PLEASE CHECK THE MARGINS WHEN YOU ARE FINISHED! 
     SHOULD NOT BLAST OPERA'S MARGINS OUT! HAVE A LOOK INSIDE
     YOUR OWN BROWSER WHEN YOU FINISH!  --> 
<br>
  <br>
  The first step is not to hurry on softices breakpointing. Sit down, 
use some 
  good old "zen cracking" attitude and think a little about what this 
prog could 
  do.<br>
  <br>
  Now, since there is a feature to remove the ads - for people rich 
enough to 
  escape the advertisement hell reserved for slaves and poor sods - this 
means 
  that this target MUST keep a flag for it, a flag that decides wether 
the owner 
  has enough money to escape advertisement or not. Of course this flag 
(let's 
  say either true "poor_sucker= 0 give him hell" or false 
"poor_sucker= 1 he may 
  escape without ads") must be either inside a kore or less "hidden" 
file or inside 
  the registry.<br>
  Dead easy, of course: We use the <font color= blue>regmon</font> tool 
and check 
  and uncheck the display ads option. But nothing interesting happens. I 
also 
  tried to check with filemon,<br>
  just to see if it looks for a flag hidden inside a lost file, nothing 
again.<br>
  My last solution was to see if this program use a flag hidden inside 
its resources, 
  and to load a resource string, you can use loadlibraryA.<br>
  I found this part inside its disassembly :
<p><br>
  0046E270 <br>
  0046E270 push ebp<br>
  0046E271 mov ebp, esp<br>
  0046E273 add esp, 0FFFFFBF8h<br>
  0046E279 mov [ebp+var_8], edx<br>
  0046E27C mov [ebp+var_4], eax<br>
  0046E27F push 400h<br>
  0046E284 lea eax, [ebp+var_408]<br>
  0046E28A push eax<br>
  0046E28B mov eax, [ebp+var_4]<br>
  0046E28E push eax <b>&lt;-string number inside the resource</b><br>
  0046E28F mov eax, ds:dword_5798B4<br>
  0046E294 push eax<br>
  0046E295 call LoadStringA_0 <b>&lt;-Put a bpx on this with softice 
before searching.</b><br>
  0046E29A mov ecx, eax<br>
  0046E29C lea edx, [ebp+var_408]<br>
  0046E2A2 mov eax, [ebp+var_8]<br>
  0046E2A5 call sub_403F2C<br>
  0046E2AA mov esp, ebp<br>
  0046E2AC pop ebp<br>
  0046E2AD retn</p>
<p><br>
  Then , after the bpx, you start a search,<font color= blue></font> 
and you stop 
  just before the loadstring call, just at this location on win 2k.<br>
  The String number pushed is 0xC49A, 50330 in decimal. Take a resource 
editor 
  and look for this string, nothing inside...<br>
  Easy to guess, on the regged version, this string resource contains a 
flag, 
  checked just before you start a search.</p>
<p>To see what happens next, p-ret twice, you land here :</p>
<p>0054C24B ; CODE:0054C204=18j<br>
  0054C24B lea edx, [ebp-0FCh]<br>
  0054C251 mov eax, [ebp-2Ch]<br>
  0054C254 call sub_4095B8<br>
  0054C259 mov edx, [ebp-0FCh]<br>
  0054C25F lea eax, [ebp-2Ch]<br>
  0054C262 call sub_403EDC<br>
  0054C267 mov edx, [ebp-2Ch]<br>
  0054C26A mov eax, ds:dword_5778B0<br>
  0054C26F call sub_4DA868<br>
  0054C274 call sub_46EDFC<br>
  0054C279 test al, al &lt;- <b>you are here</b><br>
  0054C27B jnz loc_54C31A<br>
  0054C281 mov eax, ds:dword_5778C0<br>
  0054C286 cmp byte ptr [eax+0Ch], 0<br>
  0054C28A jz short loc_54C2B4<br>
  0054C28C mov eax, ds:dword_5778C0<br>
  0054C291 mov edx, [eax]<br>
  0054C293 call dword ptr [edx+4]<br>
  <br>
</p>
<br>
The call 46edfc checks for the fake string inside the resource, not 
presentif 
your app is not registered into their server, then al contains 0 if so, 
the jz 
to 56eb06 is not taken and it shows the ads.<br>
<br>If you force the jz to jump, the ads will never be showed.

I usually don't like cracks, sauf for mere  learning purposes, and 
ususally 
I would encourage readers to buy programs, but our patience is really 
tested by 
these guys, who take your money and at the same time spit on your faces 
with  
this awful banner  autoshow feature. So I encourage you to create this 
patch and spread  
it with the keygen, until those guys remove the feature on the next 
version.
