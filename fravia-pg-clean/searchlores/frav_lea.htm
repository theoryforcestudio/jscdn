I have been often criticized for my "europacentrical" Weltanschauung, and for the many 
"antiamerican" drops that I allegedly have spread. Yet I have no doubt whatsoever that we (rest of 
the world) have  not only a lot to teach, but also 
a LOT to learn from our american friends (and I have so many friends in the States that 
I know very well how stupid antiamerican stereotypes are).  Here is a tiny, yet in my opinion terrific example. 
How to use the web for more democracy, transparency, accountability. A simple, effective, clever, 
 factual, to use a puking word... even "pro-active"... 100% american approach. And I bet it works. I love it. My unconditional admiration for whomever 
thought it out and implemented it.

<font size=+2>Woha!</font><br>
Igittigitt! Have a look at this succulent <a href="http://lcvap.groupstone.net/dig_enn.asp">link</A>.
<br>Should it disappear, 
I made a <a href="copylink11.htm">local copy</a> of it just in case, with images...
<br>
                                                                                   
Now let's have a closer, evaluating, look (I made the <font color=red>red</font> highlights):
<br> <br>

<center>
<table border="1" width=650><tr><td>
<center>
<font color=blue face= Arial>
<font color=red>How</font> did your member of Congress vote???
<br><br>
189 members of Congress actually voted against <br>
stricter standards for arsenic in <font color=red>your</font> drinking water.
<br>...<br>
Just type in your zip code to <font color=red>find</font> out
<font color=red>how</font> the elected officials from <font color=red>your</font> state
<font color=red>really voted</font> on the environment. {FORM}
</font></center>
</td></tr></table>
</center>
<br>
This is a TERRIFIC, great idea. Note that there is a form that zaps a database with 
the names of those elected representatives that have taken the described political position.  
<br>Note also that you are looking at the 'main page', but that this "advertisement" 
appeared -as well- as a "right side column" on some portals � la Yahoo. Yes! Like any 
idiotical, banal, commercial advertisement, 
yet with a spicy difference here... let's underline it...
<br><br>
Of course the relevant data: "who voted what" are all 
'theoretically' public, in the States and elsewhere,
 and of course anyone COULD have 
had access to them. 
    <br>
Yet, &nbsp;<i>nota bene</i>&nbsp; they DID NOT: in my experience, with few exceptions, 
NO NEWSPAPER, 
NO MAGAZINE, NO MEDIA ever publishes <u>the names</u> of the 'responsibles' whenever 
a given law is 
passed (or blocked). 
<br>
This allows huge margins of meddling for all sort of dark lobbies, 
since their (bought) "elected 
representatives" never have to fear 
in the least that some light will be ever shed on their mischiefs.
<br><br>
The "LCV accountability project" described above is &nbsp;<i>de facto</i>&nbsp;, nothing else than an 
environmental "counterlobby", that much is clear. So what?<br>This does not disturb me... 
in a world where the anti-environmental 
lobbies are so strong, numerous, active and well-funded to provoke the weekly catastrophes 
we are used to  
nowadays, a "pro-environmental lobby" is something I can live with :-)
 <br><br>Here is how they describe themselves:
<ul><li>     
<font color=blue>We hold Members of Congress accountable for their votes and actions 
on environmental issues</font>.<br> <i>(Terrific idea! "Accountability" in 
Internet times is a terrible weapon! Can 
bite the lobbied morons' asses till they  bleed out the money they have pocketed!)</i>&nbsp;
</li>
<li><font color=blue>We educate voters about their Congressional delegation's real environmental
records using grassroots and media campaigns</font>.<br> <i>(Yep! 
 Incredible power of transparence 
in a world were oligarchs have all the power (and often even OWN all the TV channels)
 and slaves must "vote for the pharaons, thank them for the 
whipping  
and shut up")</i>&nbsp;
</li>
<li><font color=blue>We provide an impartial, non-partisan look at how Congress addresses our 
environmental future</font>.<br> <i>(This is of course completely balooney, just 
a rhetorical lie... so what?&nbsp;:-)</i>&nbsp;
</li>
<li><font color=blue>The LCV Family of Organizations--LCV Accountability Project, 
League of Conservation Voters (LCV) and LCV
Education Fund--works full time to educate voters and empower 
them to shape a pro-environment Congress</font>.
<br> <i>(Translated, this mean: "we are an environmental lobby, give us money")</i>&nbsp;
</li></ul>
<br><br> 
Yet, even so, even with these last, small and obvious, shortcomings, this remains a TERRIFIC, great idea.
<br><br>

As anyone  knows, lobbies, driven by commercial interest, rule the day 
in the shadowy corridors of 
the powers that be, in Washington, Moscow, Brussel and Tokio (and wherever else 
you care to think of, in our fully 'globalized' world).<br>
Of course, &nbsp;<i>eo ipso</i>&nbsp;, any 'success' of such lobbies translates into a [deteriorating 
environment / worse quality of life / shorter life-expectancy / you name yourself the evil 
consequence] for each and every citizen. This is a tautological statement. 

<br><br>I believe that lobbysts puppeteers are <u>inherently</u>  
evil, even worse than advertisers, microsoft programmers, military generals and even tattooers: 
they always "buy" their results (and personal advantages)  
on the skin of everyone else.<br><br>
In order to be successful, however, they have to keep somehow shy, they privilege 
low-profile: See: the politicians they have 
actively bought have "unsure" feelings: 
they do not like being spotted, listed, pointed out. No, they don't, corrupted 
politicians are fragile fellows, poor creatures.<br><br> 
 There is a sort of 
gentlemen agreement, between the lobbysts' puppeteers and their political minions and lackeys: 
"listen buddy: you do what 
we told you to do, and do not worry, we will mask it somehow, and noone will care nor speak about 
it anyway. One more glass of  Moet & Chandon?"
<br><br>
But the American example above 'cuts across' such careful shy, low profile, fragile 
threads, and brings (some) 
transparence, highlighting responsibles through very easy to have informations. 
<br>If a senator has voted in order -say- to avoid any serious 
investigation after a desaster, you (and your readers, and even his electors) can smell something 
fishy twenty servers away&nbsp;:-)<bR>
Simple, effective, clever.<br><br>
Since I live in Europe I will make an example of possible 'best practice' spreading here in the old 
continent.

<br><br>First of all it is worth recalling that, through 
the recent 
<a href="frav_eu1.htm">How to access ANY European Union document</a>
 essay, anyone CAN actually find, for instance  
in the <a href="http://www.europarl.eu.int/plenary/default_en.htm#minutes">European 
parliament's minutes</a>, the names of those that 
did vote in order to ALLOW all sort of nasty (and obviously heavily lobbied) developments: 
just to name a few examples (hope readers will send feedback on this, hehe&nbsp;:-):

<ul>
<li>[night flights over your town]</li>
<li>[cigarettes advertisement during sport events]</li>
<li>[higher fees for university access]</li>
<li>[longer working time] Here there's even a kinda "evil sarcasm": the 
"Arbeit macht frei" EU-proposals, that raise the official pensionable age due to the
difficulties (read: mismanagement) of public budgets,   
are for instance euphemistically called "Measures to help prolong active life". How nice.</li>
<li>[reduced minimum wages] </li>
<li>[less resources for public transport]</li>   
<li>[destruction, sale, of public green to privates]</li>
</ul>
<bR><br>
Now, of course, you can use a similar approach and fetch similar (potentially useful, as we have seen) 
data also on your own microcosmus: for isntance in  
<a href="http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm/cmmop01.htm">London</a>, 
<a href="http://www.governo.it/servizi/verbali_conferenze/index.asp?f=38">Rome</a>, 
 <a href="http://dip.bundestag.de/parfors/parfors.htm">Berlin</a>,

or  even  -say- 
<a href="http://216.239.51.100/search?q=cache:VKemQZwlQUYC:www.villefranche.net/cm/09092002.doc+chambre+proces+verbal&hl=en&ie=UTF-8">Villefranche</a>&nbsp;:-)
   <br>
What's sure is that -as a searcher- you'll find everywhere enough material to send some mighty snowball down your 
local council hill :-)
<br><br>   
This kind of approach may be followed, of course, not only in Europe, 
but -increasingly, and thanks to the sheer might of the web- anywhere, 
using it to check (and if necessary punish, or at least irritate&nbsp;:-) any "public" body 
wherever located. 
<br><br>In fact "the powers that  be"  
have a bitter choice: <ul><li>EITHER they choose <u>not to publish at all</u>, never, 
nothing relevant on line and anyway -apart from the obvious  
of lack of transparency-  even in that case, mostly, 
you will be able to find the relevant information <u>on paper support</U> in 
any good library... and then you may decide to 
port it to the web yourself&nbsp;:-)</li><li>
<u>OR</U> they do (because 
they realize that they 
<a href="http://europa.eu.int/eur-lex/en/news/20020117_01.html">have to</a>) publish their 
minutes, with all details, and vote results... <br>
Yet they forgot that you are a web-searcher, not a zombie reader of newspaper � la Murdoch...<br>
and therefore, see! The stinking 'minutes-pies' 
are all ready for you, all lined up, for you, on the web, all  
ready to be thrown and smashed (with gusto)  
on the lobbysts ugly faces...  and if you also manage to have a 
camera ready and close by... igittigitt!
