 The following 'tips' are mostly targeted for SHORTTERM fast searching.
 <br>
 If you  embark in a <u>longterm</u> searching project, be aware that some 
 ad hoc searching techniques  <a href="longtermsearching.htm">will be different</a>. 
 <br>Ditto for  "<a href="deepweb_searching.htm">deep web</a>" searching purposes.
 <br>
 And do not forget the <a href="effective_searching.htm">general golden rules</a> for all kind of web-searching either.  

<a name="intro"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<table border=1 width=88%><tr><td bgcolor="#C6E7C6"><center><font
size=+3><font color=blue>"Ready or not, here I come!"</fonT></font>&nbsp;</center></td></tr></table>

<br><font size=+1> 

On the ad hoc <a href="quickforms.htm">Quickforms</a> page you'll find a useful mask 
listing the most important (in our biased opinion) among the (many) <a href="main.htm">main</a> search engines. 
Shortterm 
broad searches can be all usefully started from
there.<bR> This page is peppered with "seekers' proverbs" (gatered alltogether <a href="tips.htm#sepro">here</a>), because 
deemed useful for meme-mnemonic purposes... and also because they are great fun&nbsp;:-)  
<br><br>
        
Note that 
 some of the examples given here can be used for any kind of search, and are not necessarily limited to short term searches.<br><br>
 Indeed for any search, shortterm or longterm, 
a very important 
thing, a priority, is its <font color=blue>preparation</font>: <u><b>where</b></u> are you going to search and <u><b>what</b></u> are you going 
to search. Both these 
aspects require some thoughts.
<br>A simple short "auto-brainstorming" before beginning your search, writing down your 
<font color=blue>scope</fonT> and <font color=blue>a preliminary list of keywords (and query terms)</font> will pay jackpots whenever 
you risk to run amok and then get lost inside the dark web-woods: there's simply too much interesting stuff on the web,
 and without some self-discipline and a clear scope you'll waste a lot of time when searching. Remember that if a seeker hasn't found what he 
 wanted in 15 minutes  (on a short term search... for long term searches <a href="longtermsearching.htm">things are different</a>) then 
 <u>his search strategy is wrong</u>. If it happens, 
 ditch it and start anew.
<br> 
In this aspect, as you can see,  
     a search is not all that different from that "hyde and seek" children's finding game, 
    where <font color=blue>a limited area of play</fonT> should be chosen and  the seeker <font color=blue>
    must close his eyes and count to 40</fonT> before beginning to search.<br>  
    So avoid running onto google shouting "<font color=blue>Ready or not, here I come!</fonT>"&nbsp;:-)

           	 <b>THINK ABOUT YOUR QUERY!</b><bR>              
                   Seekers do not "plunge" into 
                   a search out of the blue. Like artists, they visualize the correct result 
                   before they begin. The 'perfect' answer is driving their queries. The perfect answer <u>creates</u> 
                   the correct question(s)<br>
                   What kind of results do you want? Books? Doctoral thesis? Images?
                 News?  Biographies? How many results do you want? Three hundred pages of material? One single authoritative book? A dozen pdf-articles? 
                A short and concise essay?<br>
                   Obviously you cannot be an expert in all and every field of  
                   any and every query you will launch. But you must 
                   be an expert in the field of finding the right resources for 
                   each and every kind of query.
                   <br>Two skills a seeker needs: 
                   <font color=blue>how to formulate a question correctly</font> and   <font color=blue>knowing where to look</font>. 
                   And this means knowing which 
                   resources you should use for your searches. And this means you must first of all know how to search those very 
                   resources you should use for your searches.<br>
                     In fact each 'part' of the 
                   web requires a different approach. For instance, searches on <a href="usenet.htm">usenet</a>, on    
                   <a href="blog.htm">blogs</a> or on <a href="ftp.htm">ftp servers</a>  are 
                   not ruled by the same <font color=blue>
                    lore</font>. 
                   Also each  <a href="targets.htm">kind of target</a>, each  quarry, 
                   requires a different approach:   for instance 
                   when searching 
                   <a href="newsfeeds.htm">news</a>, <a href="images.htm">images</a> or <a href="books.htm">books</a>.  
                   <br>You must also decide if  for a given query you will have to use 
                   <a href="combing.htm">combing</a> techniques like <a href="stalking.htm">stalking</a>, 
                  <a href="luring.htm">luring</a>     or <a href="trolls.htm">trolling</a>.
                   <br>Before even beginning, think about your query: <font color=blue>prepare your question(s)</font>
                    for the perfect result and <font color=blue>decide which resources you will use</fonT>.

<b>USE VARIOUS RESOURCES!</b><bR>
Should I give only ONE advice, it would be this one. Even more important than "<font color="#0000ff">keeping on 
track</font>" (see below). Never, never, never overestimate your search tool of choice. EACH search 
engine, <a href="main.htm">main</a>, 
<a href="regional.htm">regional</a>
 or <a href="local.htm">local</a> 
has its own quirks and its own blindness patterns ("shadows"). <br>
Everytime you 'restart' a given 
search on THE SAME SEARCH ENGINE with a slightly different 
synonimical query, or on ANOTHER SEARCH ENGINE 
(<a href="images/searchenginescoverage_grey.jpg" border="1" ALT="coverage" WIDTH="436" HEIGHT="436">they don't overlap that  much, after all</a>) or on 
a more  <a href="local.htm">specific/local</a> search engine you  will get 
 different results... Thus you shouldIn large rivers one finds big fish but one may also be drowned. 
NEVER 'stick' to a given search engine 'of choice'. Learn how much they differ and - even more 
important - understand how much their own results changes over time! <bR>The web is a quicksand,  
with tides, 
and search engines databases AND ALGORITHMS are continuously changing as well. Many among the 
<a href="main.htm">main</a> search engines 
are for instance now actively 'censoring' 
results, as you will  quickly realize if you search for -say- MP3 or DVD reversing.

<div align="center"><font size="-1"><i><a href="https://searchlores.nickifaulk.com/google">Google</a> alone & you'll never be done!</i></font></div>
<br>
<br>
</li>

<a name="keep"></a>   
<li><b>KEEP ON TRACK!</b><bR>
Nothing easier than to loose your thread when you are searching 
the web.<br>As an example you could actually take this site of mine. Many of the query-examples 
given here 
represent 
links to other 
interesting (I hope) searches / places / startpoints / querystrings.<br> 
Thus the examples and links  scattered around these pages should 
offer you continuous opportunities <u>to leave this site</u> in
order to
browse to other
very promising ones.<br> 
This is done on purpose and makes one of the differences between searchlores and 
most other sites: The "hyper-bastard" approach to web page building is 
<font color=blue>to restrict click-away opportunities to a bare minimum</fonT>.  Even when a 
reference demands a link, many methods are used to hide (or at least reduce the 
visibility) of those links.<br>Everything is made in order to keep a visitor 'caged' or 'trapped' 
inside a given site. Here you'll find the exact contrary, since you <u>must</u> 
learn some <b>discipline</b> if you'r going to be a good seeker: You leave my site for good while 
searching for a target?   You'll never come back? 
Good riddance. <br>
That's the problem you'll encounter again and again on the web. You start with an aim, a scope, and you land 
inside an unknown forest of results you where actually not looking for. While this may be great fun if you take it 
as a "divertissement" once in a while, it is surely  
not in the interest of a seeker to walk astray. <font color="#0000ff">The web is a labyrinth with many exits and few 
entrances</font>. Hence the fundamental importance of <font color="#0000ff">a clear scope</font> and 
of <font color="#0000ff">an array of 
related terms</font> when you search.

</li>

<a name="more"></a>   
<li><b>MORE THAN ONE SEARCH TERM!</b><bR>
Always try to start a query with more than one term!. It is true that in some cases you will gather angles as you go, and 
that "peculiar" words (<a href="tips.htm#peculiar">see point 9</a>) will make all (or most of) 
the difference, still the web is so full of crap that one word 
searches deliver very rarely nowadays.
<bR>
This is (generally) so true that even zombies <a href="images/queries_1word_multi2007-2009.jpg">are slowly understanding it</a>: two and three words 
queries amount now (2009) to more than one half of all queries, while "one word" searches are diminishing more and more.
<bR><br>
Terminologically, note that the beastly SEOs (<a href="nemo_SEO.htm">may they all rot in hell</a>: search engine spammers, the bunch of them, that dare call 
themselves "Search engines optimizers"), 
often speak of "general" queries (for one 
or two words queries and 
"<font  color="#0000FF">long tail</font>" queries (for all queries with three or more search terms). 
<bR><br>
Finally note that in February 2009 google changed the SERPs introducing 
longer context snippets inside the results. Users 
however will see them only when  searching withy multiwords, longer queries. 
These longer context snippets
display more text (showing more of the keywords used in the query and on the resulting pages).<bR>
Compare <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=opera&rls=en&q=search+strategies&sourceid=opera&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&num=100&safe=off">search strategies</a>
 with

<li><b>EXACT SEQUENCE (and/or purposed misspelling)<font color=blue>[</fonT>""<font

<a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=opera&rls=en&q=%22Enclose+terms+in+double+quotation+marks+if+you+want+to+retrieve+those+exact+terms+in+that+exact+sequence.%22&sourceid=opera&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8">Enclose terms in double quotation marks if you want to retrieve
those exact terms in that exact sequence</a>. This is one of the most
useful ways to cut ballast out in order to find a specific target. Thus "searchengines" will give
you  pages with the two terms 'glued' together, "search engines" will give you results with the two terms separated (by a space OR by 
an interpunction) while <a href="http://search.ask.com/web?q=%22search+engines+results%22++OR+%22searchengines+results%22+OR+%22s.e.+results%22+&qsrc=1&o=0">"search engines results"  OR "searchengines results" OR "s.e. results" </a> 
will give you pages with ANY of these three occurrences.  <br><br>
Note that some relevant pages may still remain outside your vision. At times <font color=blue>misspelling</fonT> can be used for better searching:
 "s<font color="#0000ff">ae</font>rch engines" will
retrieve  pages WITH THIS SAME (and common) MISSPELLING ERROR. Try for instance 
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&safe=off&client=opera&rls=en&hs=TY3&num=100&q=serach+strategies&btnG=Search">serach strategies</a>&nbsp;:-)

 &nbsp;<font color="#FF0000">AND NOT</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#FF0000">-</fonT>&nbsp;</b><br>
Narrow your searches by linking your search terms with AND or &,
or simply use
the plus sign <font color=blue>[</fonT>+<font color=blue>]</fonT>.
The search engine will find only those pages that contain all of
your search terms.
Similarly, exclude pages that are not relevant to your search by
preceding the search term with AND NOT or | or simply use the
minus sign <font color=blue>[</fonT>-<font color=blue>]</fonT>.

<a name="downplus"></a>   
<li><b>DOWNSIDE OF THE <font color=blue>+</font> & <font color=blue>-</font> SIGN</b>
<br>With the
<b><font color=blue>+</font></b> sign you may miss related documents that don't have the
words you specify as required. For example, the search
<a href="http://beta.search.msn.com/results.aspx?q=%22searching+tips%22+%2Bsearchlores&FORM=QBHP">"searching tips" +searchlores</a> would ONLY
LIST results
that have the words
"searching tips", if they also have the term "searchlores".
 <br>With the <b><font color=blue><a name="think"></a>   -</font></b> sign it's, on the other hand, easy to exclude too much. For example, if you were
looking for information on "bots script" but not in
javascript, the search <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=%2B%22bots+scripts%22+-javascript&prssweb=Search&ei=UTF-8&x=wrt">+"bots scripts"
-javascript</a> would exclude
any document  about bots scripts with
a sentence like "this kind of bot would be impossible in javascript"   (it's just an example: 
there's on the web no page -<a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=%22this+kind+of+bot+would+be+impossible+in+javascript%22&prssweb=Search&ei=UTF-8&x=wrt">apart 
	this one 
you are reading</a>- with that specific sentence, which means you could <font color="#0000ff">also use such a link for perennial linking</font>, 
coz it would work indipendently from wherever I could move this page)

<br><br>
 

</li>
<a name="downops"></a>   
<li><b>DOWNSIDE OF THE <font color=blue>BOOLEAN</font>
operators</b><bR>
                   Some search engines, like <a href="http://www.alltheweb.com/advanced">Fast/Alltheweb</a> have 
a special boolean box for a very limited boolean searching pleasure (<font color="#0000ff">AND</font>, <font color="#0000ff">OR</font> and 
<font color="#0000ff">NOT</font>).<bR>
It's often difficult to specify exactly what you want to include
or exclude.
You can also get unexpected results if you are not careful about
your use
of operators and parentheses. <br> For example, the search 
<a href="http://www.alltheweb.com/search?advanced=1&cat=web&jsact=&type=phrase&q=seeking+OR+searching+AND+%22finding+good+results%22&itag=crv&_stype=adv&_b_query=seeking+OR+searching+AND+%22finding+good+results%22+&l=en&ics=utf-8&cs=utf8&wf%5Bn%5D=3&wf%5B0%5D%5Br%5D=%2B&wf%5B0%5D%5Bq%5D=&wf%5B0%5D%5Bw%5D=&wf%5B1%5D%5Br%5D=%2B&wf%5B1%5D%5Bq%5D=&wf%5B1%5D%5Bw%5D=&wf%5B2%5D%5Br%5D=-&wf%5B2%5D%5Bq%5D=&wf%5B2%5D%5Bw%5D=&dincl=&dexcl=&geo=&doctype=&dfr%5Bd%5D=1&dfr%5Bm%5D=1&dfr%5By%5D=1980&dto%5Bd%5D=5&dto%5Bm%5D=5&dto%5By%5D=2006&hits=100&ocjp=1">seeking 
	OR
searching
AND "finding good results"</a> is the same as the search 
<a href="http://www.alltheweb.com/search?cat=web&cs=utf8&q=+seeking+OR+%28searching+AND+%22finding+good+results%22%29&rys=0&itag=crv&_sb_lang=pref">seeking 
	OR (searching AND
"finding good results")</a>.<bR>
Both queries will find documents that contain both searching and
"finding good results" (<font color="#0000ff">good results</font> added in order to keep results down),
together with documents that contain the word seeking. However,
the query
<a href="http://www.alltheweb.com/search?cat=web&cs=utf8&q=%28seeking+OR+searching%29+AND+%22finding+good+results%22&rys=0&itag=crv">(seeking 
OR searching) AND "finding good results"</a> is not the same. It will find
documents
containing the word "finding good results" and, in the same document, either
seeking or
searching. (Incidentally if you get a first result, as in this case, that BREAKS the OR operator, because it has both searching and seeking, 
you discover a paying-spam site that shouldn't be in the first position at all).
<br>Anyway the point is: 
 be careful with the
boolean operators!

<li><b>PECULIAR STRINGS & QUERYTERMS!</b><br>
A most important tip! 
You should always strive to use differentiating keywords when
searching
the web. Words that are commonly used will not help you much.
Besides, extremely common words, like articles and prepositions ("stopwords") are 
     often 
<font color="#0000ff">completely ignored</font> unless you force them with a <font color="#0000ff">+</font> 
(of course each language has its own ad hoc set of stopwords, for english usually the following ones: the,		
and,		
a,	
to,		
of,		
in,	
i,	
is,		
that,		
it,		
on,		
you,		
this,		
for,		
but,	
with,		
are,	
have,	
be,		
at,		
or,		
as,	
was,	
so,		
if,	
out,
not). Thus a search like <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&hl=en&lr=&safe=off&q=but+not+me+again+with+you&btnG=Search">but not me again with you</a>  
is rather pointless, if you really need that, try at least <font color="#0000ff">to break it into chunks</font>: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&hl=en&lr=&safe=off&q=%22but+not+me+again%22+%22with+you%22&btnG=Search">"but not me again" "with you"</a>. 
<br>Try to use words which underline
the peculiarity of your target. Common words, when combined with
boolean qualifiers, can be very effective. 
As usual when web-searching, gather words to build your ad hoc "core vocabulary": 
you must identify the
main concepts in your topic and determine any synonyms,
alternate spellings, or variant word forms for the concepts.
Remember that the most "peculiar" a word, the more useful
it will be in order to sharpen your search.    <br>
<a
href="http://www.altavista.com/web/results?pg=q&text=yes&kl=XX&q=%2Btitle%3A%22search+strategies%22+%2Bhints+%2Btips&act=search&nbq=50">+
title:"search strategies" +hints +tips</a> (and <font  color="#0000FF">&nbq=50</font>)<br>
in this case we did include the "search strateg*" string (which
already has
an elevate <font color="#0000ff">Peculiarity</font>) in the <font color=blue>title:</fonT> special search term (parameter/operator).    
<br>(Incidentally this kind of search is also useful to 
discover plagiarists and copycutter clowns&nbsp;:-)
<br><br>
Experiment! Try for instance the broad (peculiar) opening queries: <br>
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&client=opera&rls=en&as_qdr=all&num=100&q=searching.knowledge+OR+searching.experience+OR+searching.intuition+-site%3Acom&btnG=Search">searching.knowledge OR searching.experience OR searching.intuition -site:com</a>
<br>or<br>
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&client=opera&rls=en&as_qdr=all&num=100&q=%22perfect.searcher%22+OR+%22best.searcher%22+OR+%22accomplished.searcher%22+-site%3Acom&btnG=Search">"perfect.searcher" OR "best.searcher" OR "accomplished.searcher" -site:com</a>
<br>
or the narrower (peculiar), closing ones:<br>
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22web+searching+successes%22+-site:com&hl=en&lr=&client=opera&rls=en&as_qdr=all&num=100&filter=0">"web searching successes" -site:com</a>

<li><b>SPECIAL OPERATORS</b><br> Note the use of advanced operators and special parameters in the
previous example.
Here a  list of the "special search terms"
for altavista:<ul><li>domain:domainname &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to avoid

<br></li><li>inurl:text &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp; the "<font color=blue>inurl:</fonT>" operator is a godsend for any educated seeker
<br></li><li>title:text
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp; the "<font color=blue>title:</fonT>" operator is always most
 useful for narrowing your queries
<br></li><li>url:text

 <br> Each search engine has its own advanced operators, and  seekers are

<br><br> 


<ol>
<li><b>ASTERISK</b><font color=blue>[</fonT>*<font

Note also the use of the asterisk <font color=blue>[</fonT>*<font

the  example <a
href="http://www.google.com/search?num=25&hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=utf-8&q=%22index%2Bof%2F%22+%22rain.wav%2A%2A%2A%2A%2A%2A%22&btnG=Google+Search">"index+of/" 
"rain.wav******"</a>: usually on most search engines an asterisk 
must be used <font color="#0000ff">after at least 3 characters</font> 
	from the beginning of the term, 
and it is valid
<font color="#0000ff">for up to 5 characters</font> (or as an element of a phrase).
<br></li><li><b>Question Mark (<font color=blue>?</font>)</b>: After 3
specified characters will match
exactly one more character.<br></li>
<li><b>Double (or more) Asterisks</b> (<font color=blue>**</font>)
More flexible operator, as it will search for
matches for an unlimited number of
trailing characters.<br></li> </ol>
You
also have the ability use the wildcards interchangeably and more
than once in the same search
string. Here a rather complex, but very interesting example for google, quite 
useful for some specific 
<a href="usenet.htm">usenet</a> searching circumstances: <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?as_q=%2b%28%22ftp%3A//%22%20OR%20%22http%3A//%22%29%20%2b%28%22*.zip%22%20OR%20%22*.exe%22%20OR%20%22*.rar%22%29%20-link%20group%3A*crack*%20OR%20group%3A*fido7*%20OR%20group%3A*2600*%20&safe=images&ie=ISO-8859-1&as_drrb=q&as_qdr=d&lr=&hl=en">+("ftp://" OR "http://") +("*.zip" OR "*.exe" OR "*.rar") -link group:*crack* OR group:*fido7* OR group:*2600* </a>
<br><br>
</li>
<a name="archive"></a>
<li><b>ARCHIVE YOUR SEARCHES!</b><bR>
You should archive your useful queries and repeat them over time.
All
search engines  queries
 can be saved and used
again later. Since the results of all queryes <font color="#0000ff">VARY
WITH THE TIDE</font> (when traffic
is particolarly heavy the search engines "cut" the results) you
would be well
advised, for important queries, to repeat them again and again in other timeframes.
<br>
 <font color=blue>Keep records</font> of all your search activities! 
 Systematic record keeping is OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE when searching. The classical mistake 
of almost all newbie seekers is to 'forget' to keep records during their searches.<br>
For this purpose I suggest you simply use the NOTE function in <a href="tuttiope.htm">Opera</a>, just highlight the target 
text you are interested in, 
rightclick, and then chose <font color=blue>copy to note</font> (or use the keyboard shortcuts, either
 CTRL+SHIFT+C or CTRL+ALT+E depending from the version of Opera you are using): 
the URL of the page you'r viewing at that moment and the date <font color="#0000ff">will be automatically stored in your note 
together with the highlighted text</font>.<br>
You should create ad hoc <font color=blue>note folders</font> (for instance 
"<font color=blue>research_on_canaletto_29SEP2005</font>") and, at the 
end of your search, before switching the box off and go to sleep, just move all your 
related notes inside the correct folders. Opera's Notes are just text format, very easy to edit, 
cat, search or prune.<br>
Alternatively use something else, even a pen and a sheet of paper will do. DO NOT rely on your memory alone (or on your 
extraordinary seeking capabilities to re-find at once what you may have lost&nbsp;:-)<br>
If you do, you will regret it. Sooner 
than you believe.

<b>SNOOPING BOLDLY AROUND</b><bR>

As you'll learn elsewhere on this site, there are many methods to access 
some -ahem- 'non public' portions of the web.
<br>
A quick, simple tip, is to always look for the presence of a file called ROBOTS.TXT in the main directory of your 
target site, entering per hand the URL; let's say:<br>
<font color="#0000ff">http://www.targetsite.com/robots.txt</font><br>
This file is used to tell search engines which directories and files they <font color=blue>should 
not</font> index on a specific site. Thus anything that has been put inside a 'robots.txt' file 
will not (well, "should not", in fact not all search engines 'behave') be found by your searchqueries. 
However, once you have seen the name of the forbidden subdirectories, you can 
still type them directly into your browser in order to access all their 
 pages.

The 'down yonder' problem is well known by searchers. Being easily spammed <a href="https://searchlores.nickifaulk.com/inks.htm#SE0beasts">by the beastly SEOs</a>, 
all main search engines -and especially <a href="google.htm">google</a>-  
suffer a terrible draw-back: indeed some interesting results may be listed 
somewhere, yet the

       <br><font size=+2 color=blue>Some notes: fast vs slow searching (by Mordred)</font><br><br>         
There is a side to searching which - while actually well covered in information - 
is not clearly stated - WHEN do you want your results. I think that there is an important 
border between <font color="#0000FF">finding fast</font> (FF: that's when you need a quick answer) and 
<font color="#0000FF">finding slow</font>  (SF) 
(for example:   <br><br>
- things that are NOT YET answered,<br>
- generic time consuming research, <br>
- searching for "all of" (instead of "any of", which is more likely into the FF category) 
<br><br><br>
Thus various search techniques can be applied to the two categories:  <br>
- <a href="https://searchlores.nickifaulk.com/klebing.htm">klebing</a>, <a href="luring.htm">luring</a>, ask-an-expert <a href="combing.htm">combing</a>, <a href="password.htm">password</a> breaking are 
slow finding (SF) methods    <br>
- <a href="rabbits.htm">webbits</a>, keyword shortcuts, and other similar tricks are fast finding (FF) methods  <br>
- some, like <a href="combing.htm">combing</a> & <a href="yoyo1.htm">yoyo</a>, are useful in both  cases   <br><br>

For example, searches of 'where is my car' 
type are obviously calls for quick answers, and if the 
info you need is short, you can even get it in the SERP 
summaries (the <a href="rabbits.htm#inde2">asterisk (*)</a> trick is nice, and also 'asking the answer'). 
Yesterday I looked for some time the metaspy erom mentioned 
at the seeker's and saw with my very eyes the query [what 
is brittany speers shoe size], I swear! With a quick fix of 
the spelling and some quotes you can get ["britney spears" "shoe size *"] faster than 
the guy can figure out why google asks him for an alternative spelling, 
when his own is undoubtedly right. 
                              <br><br>
Also, a useful thing to mention is what to do when you realize your search strategy is wrong - like: <br><br>
If you get little or no results in a <a href="main.htm">main</a> SE, switch to metasearch.<br> 
If your keywords are too generic, try a SE that can cluster results (kartoo-like) until you learn enough specific keywords about your target.    <br>
If your target is very topic specific, find a topic-centric SE <br>
