<br><b>Searching an image without knowing its name</b><br>
<br>by An Argy</font> (<b>anargy(AT)linuxmail.org</b>)<br>
<br>slightly edited by fravia+, published @ <a href="https://searchlores.nickifaulk.com/www.searchlores.org">searchlores</a> in <b>March 2001</b><br>
<hr><i>Hey, we have often enough discussed the importance of <a href="nomomen.htm">NAMES</a> on 
the web (and in older medieval studies&nbsp;:-) Now it's time to see how we can wizard a 
specific target 
out of the pond WITHOUT having its name... in fact, how to find an image when we have only a 
vague description of it. Some experiments on these lines where started by Giglio a long web-time ago in his 
<a href="c_third.htm">third classroom</a>, I recall.

The following essay is badly in fieri... when and if someone will send more 
on these lines we'll start a sansname.htm section&nbsp;:-)

Dear Fravia+,
<br><br>
I don't have the time to prepare a full-fledged essay
but I will try to provide a concise layout. A simple,
early algorithm is explained in the following table:<br><br> 
<center>
<table border=1>
<tr><td colspan=6 bgcolor="#C6E7C6"><center>available description</center></td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor=white colspan=3><center>false inaccurate</center></td>
<td></td>
<td bgcolor=yellow colspan=2><center>true  accurate</center></td></tr>

<tr><td bgcolor=white><center>completely false and/or devious delusive</center></td>
<td bgcolor=white colspan=2><center>partly false</center></td>
<td></td>
<td bgcolor=yellow><center>sufficient for a direct search attempt</center></td>
<td bgcolor=white><center>insufficient for a direct search attempt</center></td>
</tr>


<tr><td bgcolor=white><center>total reconstruction of the description</center></td>
<td bgcolor=white><center>insufficient for a direct search attempt</center></td>
<td bgcolor=yellow><center>still sufficient for a direct search attempt</center></td>
<td></td>
<td bgcolor=yellow><center>...hence...</center></td><td bgcolor=white><center>discovery of the missing critical elements, enhancement of the descriptions</center></td></tr>

<tr>
<td></td>
<td bgcolor=white><center>discovery of the missing critical elements, enhancement of the 
descriptions, riddance of any misleading info</center></td>
<td bgcolor=red colspan=3><center>Bingo!</center></td></td><td></td></tr>
</table>

So, we are looking
for an old photo that shows the two architects of a specific bridge as 
they represent -using their arms, some rope and a few sandbags- the 
method of the construction. We have no idea of their names or the name of 
the bridge. The critical point still is to find the correct keywords. 
So, let's try to imagine some of them:
<br><br>
"bridge", "architects", "civil", "engineers", "arms", "rope",<br>
"sandbags", "method", "construction", "build","photograph"...
<br><br>
Feed good old Google with anything of the above. No luck? Ok...let's 
think what might be missing or what might be false, inaccurate or 
misleading.
<br><br>
The words "arms", "rope" and "sandbags" have a much more "visual" 
dependence than the words "method" or "construction". What I mean is that 
someone who saw that photo a long time ago -and on whose description we 
rely- or saw it very cursorily, is very possible to mix up, let's say, 
the "sandbags"
with a "stack of bricks". <br><br>
Maybe we should expect much more 
effectiveness if we would rely on keywords that represent the "logical" or 
"semantic" content of
the photo than the "visual" description of it.
<br><br>
So let's get rid of the keywords "arms", "rope" and "sandbags" and 
enrich our search with the keywords "model" and "principle". What do we 
get? No luck with the first one(www.brantacan.co.uk/suspension.htm)
but the second one (www.icomos.org/studies/bridges.htm) is quite 
promising.The photograph we are looking for exist nowhere in this page but we 
have just found out a very similar description. If this is it what we 
are looking for, now we know the names of the architects (J. Fowler and 
B. Baker), the name of the bridge (Forth bridge) and the fact that 
there are not two but three men in the photograph (the third one being 
Kaichi Watanabe). Now let's try to enhance our search with the new infos.
<br><br><font size=-1>
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=bridge+model+principle+forth+baker+fowler+watanabe+kaichi&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off" target=_blank>http://www.google.com/search?q=bridge+model+principle+forth+baker+fowler+watanabe+kaichi&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off</a>

</font>
<br><br>
We get just 2 results. Take a look at the first one 
(www.forthbridges.org.uk/RailBridgeMain.htm).
Nice photograph isn't it?
<br><br>
So, if the only info we have is a description of the picture we should 
never consider the description given accurate and true a priori. It 
might as well be false and misleading, totally or partly, intentionally or 
unintentionally. The only way to verify the accuracy of the description 
is to find
the picture itself and the best way to find the picture is to validate 
and evaluate everything, even
what might seem "certain" or "obvious".
