reading gandalf's <a target=_top href="http://home.digital.net/~gandalf/trollfaq.html">trollfaq</a> (always retrievable through 
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=opera&rls=en&q=Archive-name:+net-abuse-faq/troll-faq+Posting-Frequency:+monthly&sourceid=opera&num=100&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8">"Archive-name: net-abuse-faq/troll-faq Posting-Frequency: monthly"</a>). Also, 
in order to understand this lore, you better have already 
 acquired an adequate knowledge of <a href="usenet.htm">usenet</a>.
<br><br>
As a matter of fact, on any virtual meeting point (usenet newsgroups, http:// messageboards, maillists) 
you may register "attacks" by individuals interested in disrupting the flow of 
messages.<br>


There are MANY kinds of such individuals, see for instance the <i>wondrous</I> descriptions of usenet people at   
<font color=blue>[</font><a target=_top href="http://redwing.hutman.net/~mreed/">Flame Warriors</a><font color=blue>]</font>
<a name="trollo"></a><br>
<br>A <font color=blue>troll</font> is basically one who posts messages 
intended to insult and provoke <i>per fas et nefas</i> (see <font color=blue>[</font><a href="trolls.htm#troscho">Trolls and Schopenhauer</A><font color=blue>]</font> below).<br>

 For each person who responds, the poster (the troll as a person) will
consider that person "caught". The troll  (the troll as an action) is considered 
to have been a
complete success if it disrupts beyond repair the normal traffic on a newsgroup or on a messageboard. In
extreme cases, trolls are posted by groups of trollers and crossposted to
unrelated newsgroups in an attempt to
destroy those groups by flooding them with flames and off-topic ranting.
<br>

Variants:<br><b>1.</b><font color=blue>spamming troll</font>, 
one who posts -or crossposts on many newsgroups- the same, exact post, multiple times (mostly one liners: "cascade"). Some 
of these 'listings' with all answers and counter-answers, can grow into huge files.<br><br>
<a name="kook"></a>
<b>2.</b> <font color=blue>kook</font>:  
a regular poster who continually posts  messages with no apparent grounding in reality.
The kook trademark is paranoia and grandiosity.  Kooks will often   build up elaborate imaginary support structures, fake corporations
   and the like, and continue to act as if those things are real even
   after their falsity has been documented in public.

While they may appear harmless, and are usually filtered out by the   
other regular participants in a newsgroup or mailing list, they can  
still cause problems because the necessity for these measures is   
not immediately apparent to newcomers; there are several instances, 
for example, of journalists writing stories with quotes   
from kooks who caught them unaware. See <a href="http://www.crank.net/usenet.html" target="_blank">http://www.crank.net/usenet.html</a> for more info.
<br>Some people have <a href="http://www.lart.com/auk/aukfaq.html" target="_blank">dedicated 
their lifes</a> to expose kooks, and they will warn you that '<i>It is important to note the subtle distinction between a net.kook, a net.cretin, 
a clueless newbie, troll, or garden-variety @$$hole. The newbie, one hopes, 
can acquire a clue on the installment plan even if he can't afford to buy one 
for cash; the cretin is merely stupid and/or irritating; the troll is purposely 
pulling your leg like it got caught in some heavy machinery, the @$$hole is, 
well, simply that. But a TRUE net.kook has a special fascination derived 
from his/her/its utter ineffability. Their behavior is irrational, if not downright 
weird, but they are seldom merely boring</i>'<br>
A very interesting Kookologists' <font color=blue>Manifesto</font> is "<a href="way_kook.htm">The way of the Kook</a>", this makes very good reading and it is 
much more informative as it may seem at first.
<br>   <a name="flamo"></a>
 <br> 
 <a name="flamer"></a>
<b>3.</b>
A <font color=blue>flamer</font> is one who contributes nothing but uninformative 
"ad hominem" bickering. His inventivity in names-calling and "hurting tooth poking" 
fears no matches. Even a good troll will never win against a good flamer. Yet 
<font color=blue>flaming</font> is an art that
many, many, try, few master, and nearly all think -wrongly- they are good at. So 
 since 
you (reader) are most probably <u>not</u> a good flamer,  heed the 
(sound) advice: never answer to a troll (not even in order to flame him, see below).
<br><br>    <a name="shillo"></a>
<b>4.</b>
A <font color=blue>shill</font> is one who posts messages as a spokesperson 
 or "front"
 for an unseen group or organization, usually at odds to
 the topics being discussed.<br><br>
 The shills have joined trolls
as parasitical newsgroup fauna, destroying the balance of
free discussion, degrading the level of information, feeding
like preditors on newsgroup populations that contain the
resource that they seek to convert to money.<br><br>


Remember, shills are creatures of darkness, and their enemy
is the light. Shills can
only succeed as far as they fool people, a shill is by definition
an agent of deception, similar to a con artist, but acting
on a target market instead of individuals. Shills always act on profit,
and the motive, opportunity, and promise of profit, which in
direct proportion to the degree of such, will spawn shills as surely
as rotten meat spawns magots. 
                 <br>
Awareness of shills is a first defense against shills. Shills unmasked
are no longer shills, no longer effective.  <br><br>
 As you'll see in the following, searchers can <u>use</u> trolls 
 in order to gather information, trolls attacks are often <u>organized</u> (in "waves"), 
 trolls 
 <u>coordinate</u> on usenet groups, trolls can teach us powerful <u>rhetorical tricks</u> and there are some <u>weapons</u> that you can use 
 to nuke them (apart 
 from killfiles plonking on usenet). Moreover <a href="stalking.htm">stalking</a> 
 and  <a href="luring.htm">luring</a>  techniques can and will be very useful 
 when seekers have to deal with trolls (or punish them).<br>
 But, first, learn that you can <u>troll yourself</u>, 
 in order to gather specific knowledge or information...

<i>Well... soon or later I would have had to teach you how to fish info through clever 
placed trolls anyway, so learn it right now... (I'm just speaking for those among you that did 
not know this trick already, of course </i> :-)<i> ...Unix-related trolls (or Linux ones) on 
usenet can fetch a huge amount of interesting info, if cleverly placed.</i> 
<br><br><b>
This was the troll (first relevant part, note the typical trolling style):</b>
<pre>
&gt;&gt; I get this feeling that your anti-MS because your an old school 
&gt;&gt; UNIX weenie that hates the fact of MS-NT eating your lunch with 
&gt;&gt; zero administration and fast setup?
</pre><br><b>
This was the first answer:</b>
<pre>
&quot;Zero Administration?&quot; ...Service packs that fix one problem while
introducing another.  Distributed in straight binary format with no
source code and no compiler, so you can't fix bugs in the code
yourself.  Changing simple things like IP settings requires a reboot.
Changing damn near anything requires a reboot.  On what's supposed to
be an Enterprise-class server?  The people that actually have to
administer NT systems usually _hate_ them.  Their boss is the one who
bought MS's bullshit about &quot;ease of use&quot; and &quot;reliability&quot;.
</prE><br><b>
This was the second answer (quite interesting, I believe)</b>
<br>
I can vouch for this somewhat, having to deal with an NT box at work,
although it's actually given us little trouble.  The reason for this
is that we have only *one* mission-critical function running on NT:
our  proxy  server.  The only other tasks it's used for are backing up
the network and file/application serving, neither of which would
cripple us if the box puked tomorrow.  The *real* important stuff runs
on Linux or Solaris (and, as soon as Informix ports its DB tools to
Linux, the Sun box will find itself on the doorstep the next day).
      <br><br>
What slays me about Microsoft is how badly their software can coexist
with other products, *including their own*.  A classic example is
their aforementioned  proxy  Server.  When you set up NT with the Option
Pack and Service Pack 3, it installs Internet Information Server 4.0
by default.  Which is fine, except for one small detail: it *breaks*
 proxy  Server.  We had to back IIS 4.0 out of the system and install
IIS 3.0, which has no trouble working with  proxy  Server.  AFAIK, there
is still no fix to get  proxy  Server working properly with IIS 4.0.
         <br><br>
Now tell me: if Microsoft can't be bothered to fix glaring
compatibility issues with its own products, what makes anyone think it
gives two shits about making them compatible with anyone else's?  Why
the hell did Sun sue Microsoft over the Java issue in the first place?
<br><br><b>
Second part of the troll:</b>
<pre>
&gt;&gt; UNIX hit rock bottom 2 years ago when the DOD shit canned it due to 
&gt;&gt; it high cost. NT is cheaper and faster to use. Who in their right 
&gt;&gt; mind would spend $1,500 for a crude UNIX OS when NT is better and 
&gt;&gt; almost $ 1,300 cheaper???
</pre><br><b>
First answer</b><prE>

Well, why would you need to spend $1500 when you can get your pick of
various *BSD and Linux OS's for either the cost of the CD, or the time
it takes to download?  NT Server costs $200?  I think it's a bit more
than that.  And you also have to buy client licenses by the seat.  The
more workstations you have being served by NT, the greater the cost.
</prE><br><b>
Second answer</b>
<prE>
He may be thinking of NT Workstation, which is a very different
animal.

Point of comparison: our upgrade to NT (we qualified, having run
Netware previously) cost us just under $1500 for the server and 30
client licenses (also not $200).  But Solaris is much, much more 
expensive, especially if you run it on SPARC hardware, although 
there are no client-access restrictions.
</pre><br><b>
I should add that actually both posters above realized they were 
answering to a troll, 
but, interesting enough, it worked nevertheless... and it was 
possible to fish out some anti-M$ info allright  :-)</b>

The following is the old alt.syntax.tactical (master trollers who make it their life's 
work to destroy as many
groups
as they can. They consider a group destroyed when more than three
quarters
of the threads on a group have been started by them and the group is
unusable for normal traffic) foundation for the structure, strategy, and protocol of simple 
USENET invasions. I have decided to publish it here because it gives good insight on the 
complexity of a good troll attack. Many of the tactics described here can be applied, <i>mutatis mutandis</i> to any sort 
of "lone wolf" action you may want to stage on your own. Seekers should know all sort of techniques, least 
they may suddendly need them (or need to recognize them) in some obscure corners of the web.
         <hr width=44%>  

 * Waves of Invasion *<bR>
Flames and wars between groups are as old as Usenet. What we try to do
is in many ways fundamentally different from what is or has been done in
this area.<bR>
After picking a messageboard, we call for an invasion on that msgbrd. There are a
number of phases to an invasion. Each person can volunteer for which
wave they want to be in, but more times than not, it is a first come-
first served policy. It is always important that no one jump the gun and
go in before we have time to prepare and bounce ideas off each other.
It's also important that people don't switch waves without letting
everyone know. Flexibility is the key, as is communication.<bR>
Typically, we use between two and five Waves of attack. Waves will
generally break down into this kind of structure:<bR>
  a: Reconnaissance (RECON): These people will go in early and usually
set up camp as "friends of the newsgroup". They will become trusted and
participate by joining previous discussions or starting non-
controversial ones themselves. They will also act as "double-agents" to
counter-flame the other waves as the invasion progresses. They key is
building a bit of credibility.<bR>
  b: Wave One: Wave one will usually be what starts the flame war.
Those involved in this wave can go on and each have a different flame,
or go on and flame in unison.  They can bring in a subject of their own
or flame a previous discussion. What matters is that this initial wave
will be the one that the invaded newsgroup will have their attention on.
This wave calls for extreme subtlety. The quality of the flame MUST be
at its highest point here.<bR>
 c: Wave Two: Wave Two will consist of tactics to attack the people who
were sent in as recon and attempt to start totally new flame threads.
The key here is that even if we attack a group of people restrained
enough to resist our flame-bait, wave two will stir things up and get
others to join in.<bR>
 d: Wave Three: Wave three will generally change depending on the
campaign, but will generally be added to push the confusion and chaos
over the top. Flame the recon, flame the first wave, flame the second
wave. These guys are our balls out, rude SOB's. Mop up and clean out.
Sometimes (usually with bigger groups) Wave three will simply be along
the lines of a wave two. We will call for a wave four (or five) to be
the balls out routine. We will sometimes add a wave or two because
depending on the size and intelligence of a newsgroup.<bR><bR>
 Miscellaneous Tactics:<bR>
     There are three other things that we typically use, depending on
the sophistication of the invasion.<bR>
LOOSE CANNONS are people who come in and act so strange and obtuse that
it makes the rest of the flames look genuine.<bR>
THE ANON SERVICE can be used to send posts anonymously. This is a good
way to post and pretend to be scared of retribution. Only problem is
that this is usually the first sign that a post is a flame, so it should
only be used with a TREMENDOUS amount of DISCRETION.<bR>
CROSS POSTING is also a popular method of choice by other flame groups,
so it is important to Cross Post with discretion. If we can cross post
to bring in other newsgroups to unwittingly assist us, perfect. If we
cross post to suspicious newsgroups, our intentions will be obvious.<bR><bR>
                        * Victory *<bR>
Ideally, signs of victory are the following:<ul><li>
Our names appear in killfiles
</lI><li> Majority or ALL threads in invaded newsgroup were started by us
</lI><li>Regulars/legit people abandon invaded newsgroup
</lI><li>Receive much hate mail - as does our SysAdmin
</lI><li>To be reprimanded by the glorious SysAdmin</lI></uL>
                        * Notes *<br>
Most important is the need to be SUBTLE when it is required. One
misplaced post can ruin it for the rest of us. Those of you who have
participated in widespread flame wars know the feeling of having a
newsgroup going for a long time, then someone posts an obvious flame or
something so far out of context, that everyone says to just ignore the
flames, which eventually includes all of us. Blowing a flame war will
occasionally happen, but if it could have been avoided with a little
thinking, then it's not as excusable.<br>
We've got to share duties. Everyone should get practice playing
different roles and different waves.<br>
It has been assumed that if you don't want to participate, fine. No one
will hold it against you. What is expected is that if you don't want to
participate you don't have to, but that also means that you wont go
warning that newsgroup when an invasion happens. You will close your
eyes and turn a blind eye. NO NEWSGROUP AND NO MESSAGEBOARD IS OFF LIMITS!!!!!!<br>
Another thing many people seem to be talking about are SIGS AND NAMES.
Try to take on appropriate names. If you are on alt.rap, D.J. Trouble is
not going to stir things up...if you show up on soc.culture.physics with
that name, you're caught before your first word of text. If a Sig is
going to blow your cover, lose it.

<bR><br><font size=+1>
One of the most interesting knowledge you can acquire, reading and analysing 
trollers' postings, is 
the wealth of <SPAN STYLE="color: black; background: yellow">Eristic 
Dialectic stratagems</span> they often use. In fact even tossing "verbal grenades" into the 
targeted forum
in order to cause "indiscriminate damage" <u>implies</u> rhetorical subtility and skill, if 
you want them 
to explode at the right distance and against the right targets (and not in your hands).<br>
Readers that will find the time to print and read 
Schopenhauer's masterpiece, linked below, will recognize immediately (and never fall again for) 
most of the rhetorical tactiques (indeed "stratagems") used 
by trolls on usenet newsgroups or any other messageboard or forum.<br>
Unfortunately today's "americanocentrical" world seems to ignore Schopenhauer's 
beautiful teachings (no wonder, since if people would read Schopenhauer the whole 
advertisement industry - and most politicians relying on media appearance -
would not have any chance). Few english version seem to be on the web... a -bad- 
translation I have found is <a href="schopeng.htm">here</a>, another older one is 
<a href="http://coolhaus.de/art-of-controversy/"  target="_blank"">here</a>, the most famous one (T. Bailey Saunders) is <a href="http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/s/schopenhauer/arthur/controversy/complete.html">here</a>  
yet for those of you that can 
read German, here you are with "<a href="http://www.rhetorik-netz.de/rhetorik/schopenh.htm" target="_blank">Arthur 
Schopenhauer: Eristische Dialektik oder 
Die Kunst, Recht zu behalten – in 38 Kunstgriffen dargestellt</a>".

<br>And for those that do prefer the joy of  collating a translation with the original text, ~S~ Ritz pointed out 
<a href="http://coolhaus.de/art-of-controversy/erist-i.htm">this</a> nice place.<br>
Admit it: this kind of knowledge... these 38 tricks ("stratagems") translate into 
real power for those 
in the know, eh? Quite funny, come to think of it: A sharp incredible weapon against webtrollers strategies (actually, against much more), devised 
in 1864 and more useful and valid in these web-intensive times that ever before&nbsp;:-)

Here a possible searchquery: <a target=_top href="http://www.google.com/search?q=schopenhauer+%22per+fas+et+nefas%22&hl=en&as_qdr=all&start=10&sa=N">schopenhauer "per fas et nefas"</a>

Some usenet debunking techniques are of GREAT value, because you can apply them, <i>mutatis mutandis</i> to your own local corrupt politician's jargon. 
<br>
An interesting example could be found  at  the now disappeared 
http://www.petitmorte.net/cujo/ (Cujo's World of Usenet Kooks), where the debunking of 
a notorious Kook gave an hilarious, but true, debunking-cypher-muster,
 useful to debunk many a "round table" speech. 
<br>
Here some examples (among the many other 
available all over <a href="usenet.htm">usenet</a> when dealing with trolls and kooks) that I have 
taken from 
Cujo's site before its disappearance (with some modifications)...<br><br>

<hr><center><font size=+2>Trolls' characteristicae</font></center><br>  
1) They have a lot of free time, they are mostly lonely people.<br>
2) They often
ingratiate themselves to a person or two on the group and use them to stay
in the group.  They may protest with these "friends" that their right to
free speech is being curtailed. <br>
3)  They sometimes use "<a target=_top href="http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&scoring=d&q=%22socket+puppets%22+&btnG=Google+Search">socketpuppets</a>", i.e.   
fake identities that may be used to sustain, or to inflame the troll's position or theory or attack. 
At times the socket puppets' names are anagrams or similar to 
the troll name. Thus a troll may engage in artificial  conversations with
himself. However impersonating multiple people is frowned upon by the more able trolls and is considered the lowest of
the possible
troll tactics. 


<br>
<hr><center><font size=+2>Where do trolls coordinate?</font></center><br>
Real nasty trolls operate without central coordination, and recognize themselves 
on the fly when attacking a newsgroup (or a http:// messageboard, or any kind of forum... once more:  
trolls do not operate only 
on usenet). On usenet the most (in)famous newsgroups for trolls (not for trolling, for 
coordination and experimentation) are

<hr><center><font size=+2>Trolls' "moles"</font></center><br>
As you have <a href="trolls.htm#wars">seen above</a>, a  favorite tactic of organized troll groups is to plant a
"mole" into the group - someone who looks and acts like a regular visitor / reader. Often,
the
mole  is planted a few weeks to a month in advance of an attack wave. That way, for the 
newsgroup habitat it
looks as though the invaders were attacking "one of us." Be wary of this tactic,
as it <u>lends to the mischief</u>: unsuspecting do-gooders are sucked into the
fray as they come to the defense of the the "attacked fellow".
<br>

<hr><center><font size=+2>Ongoing 
attacks</font></center><br>
Finally, if you are interested in troll wars, be aware that, apart from the obvious 
trolling opportunities caused by the 11 september attack against the States ("the WTC was so ugly 
I'm happy it went down" kind of postings on right/conservative/"americafirst" oriented forums) there is an 
interesting ongoing 
<a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&lr=&ie=ISO-8859-1&scoring=d&as_drrb=q&q=trolls&btnG=Google+Search&meta=group%3Dalt.cats.%2A">attack</a> on the <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?as_q=&num=10&as_scoring=d&btnG=Google+Search&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&as_ugroup=alt.cats&as_usubject=&as_uauthors=&as_umsgid=&lr=&as_drrb=q&as_qdr=&as_mind=12&as_minm=5&as_miny=1981&as_maxd=12&as_maxm=1&as_maxy=2002">alt.cats</a> newsgroup. This involves at least 20 trolls. 
In fact there exist even a special <a target=_top href="http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&group=alt.cats.declawing-debate">alt.cats.declawing-debate</a> newsgroup, 
that 
has been especially created (and animated) by trolls in order to annoy cat owners.

<hr><center><font size=+2>Recognizing shills</font></center><br>
Shills appears most commonly on 'reviews' and 'readers opinions' scripts, not only on 
usenet and on messageboards.<br>
There are some techniques for telling whether a contributor is a shill: <ul>
<li>Look for other reviews/contributes on the same forum to see how they compare. <br>
</li><li> Look for other reviews/contributes by the same reviewer. If there aren't any, look out! <br>
</li><li> Look for a review/contribute made by a recognized reviewer/contributor.<br>
</li><li>With respect to bad reviews, look for an obvious agenda. Contributors who 
appear out of nowhere and use highly inflammatory or gratuitously insulting language are suspect.<br></li>
<li> Always check the <i>cui prodest</i> of the contribution.
Try to understand if it could be the competition or someone else with an axe to grind.<br><br>

</li></ul>
<hr><center><font size=+2>are trolls useful? ...Yes...</font></center><br>
Yes (as somebody wrote long ago), much like hyenaes:  if a messageboard is strong and vibrant, 
with healthy ideas and intelligent discussion among posters,
then these tend to be too interested in what is going on to pay much 
attention to the trolls.  However, once a forum begins to show signs of decay - 
usually due to bickering amoung the regular visitors - then the trolls 
run rampant and it is only a matter of time before the forum disintegrates.<br>Moreover: 
  "<i>Trolls remind us that this is not private space.  
Lurkers are everywhere but it is easy to forget that. Chatting away on a thread 
with an old buddy it is easy to reveal personal details about one's life that 
you might not really want public.  
Trolls remind us that in a public forum anyone can read what we write.</i>"
<br><br>Moreover, as we have seen in <a href="trolls.htm#troscho">Trolls and Schopenhauer</A> and with <a href="trolls.htm#polspe">the debunking example</a> above, 
trolls DO deliver us many useful 
findings about "Eristic Dialectic stratagems". Findings that we can easily apply outside the world of Usenet&nbsp;:-) <br>
<br><center><font size=+2>...and no</font></center><br>
This said,  trolls and  (even more) shills are very often 
<i>de facto</i> and/or <i>de jure</i> just lackeys of the commercial 
powers that be. What all  trolls have in common is that they flood newsgroups with
inappropriate material in an effort to suppress discussion they don't
want taking place.  If it were radio, you would call it "jamming"
and everybody would agree it was censorship.  But on Usenet or on messageboards, 
the effect
is more subtle and the mechanism more complex (involving user interface
limitations of newsreading software) so it hasn'e been widely
recognized yet. Some of the most determined destroyers are
<u>professionals trollers</u> connected to people that stand 
to lose if a specific Usenet newsgroup (or any given specific messageboard) 
proves to be a viable
alternative to the(ir) controlled channels of mass communications.
<br>
Let's see how to (try to) destroy them...

A+heist<br><hr width=44%><br>
<i>What A+heist is referring to is an attack know as '<SPAN STYLE="color: black; background: yellow">ping flood</span>': 
 many large size pings sent continously against your target system in order to have a
 buffer overrun. This kind of attacks are commonly used, for instance, during IRC channels wars.<bR><bR>A well known fact is that Windows 98 (and many other toy and older 
systems) 
REBOOTS after a ping -f 65000. Often  <u>only a single</u> ping -f 65000 is 
enough to reboot the system. The  command must be issued from a Linux Box.<br> 
For slackware 3.6 Kernel 2.0.36, the correct line is:  <font color=blue>ping -f -s 65000 Target_IP_address</font><br>
If you are playing on local networks, use ping -s -l instead<bR></i><prE>
Usage: ping [-t] [-a] [-n count] [-l size] [-f] [-i TTL] [-v TOS]
            [-r count] [-s count] [[-j host-list] | [-k host-list]]
            [-w timeout] destination-list

Options:
    -t             Ping the specifed host until interrupted.
    -a             Resolve addresses to hostnames.
    -n count       Number of echo requests to send.
    -l size        Send buffer size.
    -f             Set Don't Fragment flag in packet.
    -i TTL         Time To Live.
    -v TOS         Type Of Service.
    -r count       Record route for count hops.
    -s count       Timestamp for count hops.
    -j host-list   Loose source route along host-list.
    -k host-list   Strict source route along host-list.
    -w timeout     Timeout in milliseconds to wait for each reply.

In this context I would like to recall  
the similarly famous "<SPAN STYLE="color: black; background: yellow">ping of death</span>" method. 
<br><br>
For exact information see: 
<a target=_top href="http://www.insecure.org/sploits/ping-o-death.html">http://www.insecure.org/sploits/ping-o-death.html</a>.
<br><bR>
I'll quote: billions 
of machines can be crashed sending IP packets that exceed the maximum 'dos' 
length (65535 bytes). You can send from Linux, and, 
also, of course you can hack your own dos in order 
to let it send a packet bigger than that. There are also many nukers on the web 
that have options to change the packetsize.<br>Netware, Routers, and of course toy systems like 
Windows NT and 9* can be locked, but early versions of Linux and Solaris can be nuked as well.<br>
 The attacker needs to know nothing about
the machine other than its IP address.<br>
Most implementations of ping won't allow an invalid packet (i.e. more than 65535 bytes) 
to be sent. Among the exceptions are Windows '95 and NT&nbsp;:-)<br>
This exploit is by no means
restricted to ping. The problem can be exploited by anything that sends an IP <SPAN STYLE="color: black; background: yellow">datagram</span> 
 <u>probably the most fundamental building block of
the net</u>. An IP datagram consists of an IP header and an IP payload

 The IP header is of variable size, between 20 and 60 bytes, in 4-byte increments. 
It provides routing support, payload identification, IP header and datagram 
size indication, fragmentation support, and options.
The IP payload is of variable size, ranging from 8 bytes 
(a 68-byte IP datagram with a 60-byte IP header) to 65,515 bytes 
(a 65,535-byte IP datagram with a 20-byte header).
<br><bR>Note also that not only ICMP echo, but TCP, UDP and even new style
 IPX can be used to hit machines where it hurts.

<br><hr><center><font size=+2>rebuking trolls</font></center><br>
This said, the above methods (and other more nasty ones) 
are better left to professional webwizards and "older ones" (that 
may often be willing to help you for a worthy cause). Usually the best method when dealing with trolls is always the same: 
NEVER ANSWER TO 
THEIR POSTINGS! ("<font color=blue>Please do not feed the troll</font>")
<br>
The whole point of trolling is to have you react. So do not react! 
It's as simple as that, duh. That is something that 
enrages trolls (disqualify them: other lurking trolls will take 
note of their failure and they know - and fear - it).<br> 
 By not
reacting, you have completely defeated their purpose in life. In other
words, the troll sees his self-worth in how much of a reaction he can
inspire - ignore him: it's your best
weapon.
<br>
Should you, my advices notwithstanding, answer a troll, then calm down! Do not read any of
the
troll's responses to you. He is just trying to draw you further into its
lair. Once more: NEVER ANSWER TO 
THEIR POSTINGS!
<br><br>
Once more, <font color=blue>5 easy rules</font>:

<p>(<font color=blue>1</font>) Don't read posts from or about trolls;</p>
<p>(<font color=blue>2</font>) Don't read email from or about trolls;</p>
<p>(<font color=blue>3</font>) If you can't resist reading, don't respond;</p>
<p>(<font color=blue>4</font>) If you can't resist responding, do so by email, not by posting on a public forum;</p>
<p>(<font color=blue>5</font>) If you are compelled to <i>post</i> a response, if you just can't 
stop yourself, at least do the rest of the readers the favor of adding 
the troll's nick to the subject line, so they can avoid reading that post.</p>
<br>
In case of a <font color=blue>cascade attack</font>  (by spamming trolls),  you may be able to 
help matters by posting yourself into the cascade and removing your group from 
the crossposting line.  (Cascades are those one liners piled on top of each other that spamming trolls 
so love). 					
<br><br>
In the case of <font color=blue>shills</font>  the best method is  - instead - to boldly <u>counterattack</u>: <a href="stalking.htm">stalk 
them</a>  (sometime a simple reversing of their <a href="lanpat.htm">language 
patterns</a>  will be enough) and debunk them. 
If you can individuate (or even suspect, eheh) 
the group/industry they have been working for, they are dead and everything they have damaged 
will be reversed&nbsp;:-)
