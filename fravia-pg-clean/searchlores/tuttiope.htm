SRC="images/dot_green.gif">


There are many - very important - differences between the browsers
you can use in order to access
the web. You may have to <font color=blue>choose a different browser</font> depending if you are
mining for information or not, if you seek a high
level of anonymity or not, if you want to be able to turn images
off (SHIFT+I) or not
and so on. It is a good idea to experiment on your own. Be, first
of all, aware of
<u>file sizes</u> when you choose your programs (this applies not
only to browsers, of course).<bR>
It is not a matter of size <i>per se</i>: the harddisks are
getting
cheaper and bigger every week. It is a question of what is often 
called "<font color=blue>overbloatedness</font>": this hides three main
risks.<ol><li>
 a huge program is more prone to crash: bugs
abound in all overbloated applications;
</li><li>a huge program may be more easily attacked: the number of
discovered
dangerous exploits
against Microsoft Explorer (and Netscape Navigator)
has always been proportional to their "codefat";<bR>
</li><li>a huge program can hide obvious security risks: if you
have a huge
application inside your
own PC chances are that you don't have the faintest idea about
what is
INSIDE it.</li></ol>When you'll be able to have a look (later, if
you care to learn how
to reverse) you will discover not only some 
silly easter eggs, but also various part
of the code that have been prepared in order to
easily send over the web during a connection - on the background -
all or part of your private data.  
<br>
           In addition there are MANY unpatched security
holes inside
           it, which means that even if you patch it twice a week
you will be still subject to exploits. <br>Just an example you may enjoy... <a target=_top href="http://www.google.com/search?client=opera&rls=en&q=hta+exploits&sourceid=opera&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8">hta</a> exploits...<br>And this
           makes using MSIE <font color=blue>VERY</font> silly on
the web of ours :-)   <br><br>Btw, there is a quick demonstration of the fact that 
MSIE is <font color=blue>the most unsecure browser of the planet</font>...<br> 
If you are using MSIE click on the following link
 (<font color=blue>NOTE THE ADDRESS URL</font> on 
 your top bar once you are there): <br><a target=_top href="http://www.google.com%00@www.fravia.net">http://www.google.com%00@www.fravia.net</a>
            <br>
            
                This trick is possible due to the typical Microsoft attitude to idiotize the interface,
                 hiding the "<font color=blue>username:password</font>" details of the ftp transaction 
                 from Joe Zombuser.<br> If you include a null character "%00" in a 
                 URL, or an AT sign, then nothing after the null character, or before the AT sign, 
                 will appear  to the user...    try this on <a target=_top href="http://www.opera.com/download/">Opera</a> 
                 <font color=blue>and</font> on MSIE:
                     <a target=_top href="http://www.microsoft.com%00@www.fravia.net/">http://www.microsoft.com%00@www.fravia.net/</a>  
                     and see the difference. 
                     On <a target=_top href="http://www.opera.com/download/">Opera</a> (or Firefox, or Epiphany, or any decent browser) 
                     you'll read in the Address field: http://www.microsoft.com%00@www.fravia.net/, on 
                     MSIE it will depend of your security settings and patches.
                 <br>
         URLs built like 
         <a target=_top href="http://www.google.com%00@www.fravia.net">http://www.google.com%00@www.fravia.net</a> were
          once a common trick used by scammers & thieves on the web (linking to false ebay or paypal 
            places) in order to scam zombies. Yet if these very zombies  would have used  
            <a target=_top href="http://www.opera.com/download/">Opera</a> they would not have been fooled.  
             On the other hand in that case they wouldn't be zombies either... <i>quod erat demonstrandum</i>.
<br>
<br>
<font size=+2>Footprints</font> (Bloatedness)<br> 
The differences -in size- between browsers 
are apalling: in the case of MSIE, it
is hard to calculate its
 complete size because it uses parts of the operating system. 
 Also: do a simple 
start => search for files INSIDE your harddisk on a windows XP system, 
 and check on
 your firewall loggings: see? Explorer tries to access a Microsoft spidering site 
(207.46.248.249, for instance). As you can imagine, spying on you means a bigger footprint as well.<bR>Note also that there are some
widely used
<b>non graphic</b> browsers
around, like Lynx (<font color=blue>[</font><a
href="zipped/lynxy.zip">lynxy.zip</a><font color=blue>]</font>: very small footprint, a unix/linux native 
program  that can work in a dos box in windoze and is
<u>very</u>
quick). <br>
<bR>

Given the relative sizes... it's quicker to download and install
<a target=_top href="http://www.opera.com/download/">Opera</a> than to patch 
Microsoft explorer against security exploits... something that you should do 
 <a target=_top href="http://forms.theregister.co.uk/search/?q=unpatched+IE">twice a week</a>  if
you are really
using MSIE, btw.
<bR><bR>
Some readers will believe that we are exagerating the differences in file lengths and footprints. 
Alas! Not at all: here, for the sceptics, the old 
<font color="blue">[</fonT><a href="s01003e1.htm">complete
list</a><font color="blue">]</fonT> of the <u>
zipped</u> files of the obsolete Microsoft Explorer 4. Following the 
<font color="blue">[</fonT><a href="s01003e1.htm">same link</a><font color="blue">]</fonT>
  you'll also find an
explanation of "*.cab files" extraction and some examples of huge
parts of the browser's code that
are very seldom used (or simply have been 'forgotten' inside).<bR><bR>Your chances to know what this kind
of �ber-bloated software will actually do when you are asleep (and when
you are awake as well) are
very low. Moreover the <a target=_top href="http://www.opera.com/download/">Opera</a> team was able to keep the file lengths
 relatively low, 
even when developing the browser and adding functionality. 
<br><a target=_top href="http://www.opera.com/support/service/">Hats off</a>!

browser?</font></fonT></center><hr width=44%><font

<IMG align=left valign=top width=9 height=40
SRC="images/dot_green.gif">
   Many visitors use MSIE, because they are 'used to it'. It comes
pre-installed on most systems
on sale, for 'free', and people have simply started visiting the
web using it. It has also some
advantages: first of all you will  never, or almost never (hey
Frog's+Print&nbsp;:-) find sites
that block it. <br>Most zombie sites make sure
that they look ok on MSIE and ignore every other browser.<br> Yet
MSIE has 
HUGE disadvantages. First of all it is so strictly integrated with
your operating
system that its many security holes will <a target=_top href="http://www.korelogic.com/Resources/Tools/MISC_HUNGRY.lib">compromise your
whole box</a>  everytime you surf.<br>
    <br>
    Let's explain this in detail: the real problem with the monstruously dangerous 
    MSIE is that it became more and more <font color=blue>part of the windoze operating system</font>. 
    And that's exactly the problem: a browser should NEVER be part of the operating system, else 
    it can  compromise very easily your whole box.
    
    <br>
    Other browsers have security problems too, but they are usually fixed in a couple of days, 
      <br><br>
      "<i>Microsoft knew there were problems with "shell:" a year ago and it's still not patched. Maybe they'll
       patch it with the next version of windows. Maybe: 
    Microsoft's fix for one of the latest Internet Explorer holes was 
    to deactivate the broken part, ADODB.Stream. Some fix</i>" <br>



<br>
MSIE makes it
also extremely hard to do very useful things that <a target=_top href="http://www.opera.com/download/">Opera</a> will allow
you to
do without fuss, like blocking images on the fly (SHIFT+I), or eliminating
an annoying crazy-colored background on the fly, or spitting out
all cookies immediately
after having visited the site that pestered you with them.<br>
Or the most beautiful of opera's feature, the "right click" => "block content" mighty weapon against all those annoying "revolving advertisement" 
and "moving crap" sites that slow down our searching.
<br><br>
For the reasons explained above, <a target=_top href="http://www.opera.com/download/">Opera</a> is better  <u>because of
its small size</u> as well.
 In a world of heavy megabytes browsersaurii, <a target=_top href="http://www.opera.com/download/">Opera</a> 
dimensions (both for windows and for <a href="https://searchlores.nickifaulk.com/ubuntu.htm">GNU/Linux</a>) are
less than ONE/TENTH
of most other browsers, integrated email program and  news reader
<u>included</u>.
<br>
If you use MSIE you will never have POWER: you
will probably just leave images
enabled all the time (the procedure to turn them off is so
cumbersome that it may take one
whole minute to perform it) and you will be continuously annoyed
and pestered by ads and flash  crap. <br>
But the real annoying thing with MSIE (and to a lesser degree with Firefox) is that it is <font
color=blue>slower</font>. Try a week with <a target=_top href="http://www.opera.com/download/">Opera</a>
and you WILL NEVER use MSIE again. It is a promise.
<br>
<br>
If your idea of browsing is to be passively feed whatever the site
owners want you to see... well,
in that case just 
keep your 40 megabytes MSIE and go ahead, collecting and slurping your daily doses of commercial
crap.<br>
If -on the other hand- you are browsing in order to find
information, and if you want
to decide yourself what you should endure and what you would
rather not, then <a target=_top href="http://www.opera.com/download/">switch
to
Opera</a>.

 the following commands right now... if you'r using <a target=_top href="http://www.opera.com/download/">Opera</a> as
you should :-)<br></center>

<br><font color=blue>
1</font>. Fast<br>                                 
For quite a long stretch, <a target=_top href="http://www.opera.com/download/">Opera</a> has been the
fastest browser around... and as you may imagine
this is <i>eo ipso</i> a VERY important feature when you search the web. But you
can gain even more speed...<br><br>
<font color=blue>2</font>. No images... just press "SHIFT+I"<br>
<a target=_top href="http://www.opera.com/download/">Opera</a>'s famous "no image" 
(toggling to show cached images / show images) icon is a godsend when you
have to cut through the awful
commercial web in search of informations. Press "SHIFT+I" and your <font
color=blue>SEARCHING SPEED</font> will
improve INCREDIBLY. Show me another browser capable of
this out of the box.<br><br>
<font color=blue>3</font>. SHIFT+G<br>
Toggles to "user mode" and ditches all those crap backgrounds.
<br><br>
<font color=blue>4</font>. F12<br>
Kills popups on the fly. The ANTI-annoyance menu. <a target=_top href="http://www.opera.com/download/">Opera</a> deserves a
web-nobel for this.  Try it now to disable
the silly automated gif at the top of this page. Also useful to
kill sounds and musics on annoying web-pages.<br>
Kills javascript, java and flash crap too, quite an added bonus
when you need speed and do not want crap :-) <br>
Finally it gives you an empty referrer, so no <a target=_top
HREF="hal2001/index.htm#klebi">klebing</A> is possible
on your referrers.
<br><br>
<font color=blue>5</font>. F4 (notes)<br>
CTRL+ALT+E will copy on a note the passages you found, with
automated URL retrieval and everything. 
    <br> Doubleclicking the note, the URL will be launched. So you keep information 
    you need on the ever-shifting, quicksand web. 
    
<br>For those
that need to leave some crumbles behind...<br><br>   
 <font color=blue>5</font>. ALT+F3: show (frame) source<br>
Difficoult to overestimate how useful this is when battling ads,
commercial crap and evil popups on the web :-)
   <br><br>    
   <font color=blue>5</font>the find in page box (page search)<br>
  Just type the first letters you are interested in (for instance: 
   <font color=blue>interes"</font> <u>with</u> final quotes... Voil�! See how you "hower in" to your target? :-)
   <br><br>  
  
         <br><br><font
color=blue><font size=+3><a target=_top href="http://www.opera.com/download/">Opera</a>: a browser for
seekers</font></fonT><br>edit the search.ini file!<br>
                        <br>
   In <a target=_top href="http://www.opera.com/download/">Opera</a> you can <font color=blue>define your preferred search_engines</font>, and you 
   can also define your preferred
shortcuts (letters that you use to search
trough any search engine) for them. 
<br>The most well-known shortcuts are "g" for
Google and "a" for Alltheweb/Fast, but there is nothing that 
will stop you from re-listing or adding any engine.
<br><br>
Make no mistakes, this alone is a feature that would put 
<a target=_top href="http://www.opera.com/download/">Opera</a> waay ahead of any other browser for a seeker.<br>
 By pressing F2 (Go To
Page dialog) or F8 (jump to the addressbar)
you can for instance type "r advanced searching" and automagically search <a href="usenet.htm">Usenet</a> for the string
"advanced seaching". Try it out!
                   <br><br>
You can define your own shortcuts. For example, I use "arch" to
search the <a target=_top href="http://web.archive.org/collections/web/advanced.html">web archives</a>. 
You can  see your searches and their shortcut
keyword by going to Preferences (<font color=blue>ctrl</font> + <font color=blue>F12</font>) and then using the 
option "<font color=blue>Search</font>", where you can also choose the 
preferred number of results per page.

 <IMG align=left valign=top width=9 height=40
SRC="images/dot_green.gif">There is
a very good reason, apart from size, to use
<font color=blue>[</font><a target=_top href="http://www.opera.com/download/">Opera</a><font
color=blue>]</font>
instead
of either of the
big browsersaurii: what makes <a target=_top href="http://www.opera.com/download/">Opera</a> so different is the
combination of small size, speed of loading both
Internet and local HTML documents, versatility in
loading and displaying webpages, its many customization
options and its sheer functionality. The most important
thing is that <a target=_top href="http://www.opera.com/download/">Opera</a> has <font color="blue">a very
convenient no-images icon</font> that allows you to <font
color="blue">stop on the fly
all images loading</font> from any site you are
visiting. Not a minor feat in a Web that, as
you will already have realized,
is an Ocean of knowledge... about two centimeters deep.
Most sites just
overload visitors with completely useless
graphical frills: having a browser able to stop them
"on the fly"
is a very useful <b>weapon</b>
that you will need again and again. Note also how the
development of
both browsersaurii 
went to great lengths to AVOID you having the
possibility to turn off
images (and hence advertisements).<bR>This is far from
casual of course.
In the older versions of those huge bloated browsers it was still relatively easy: for
instance in the old
netscape's navigator  you just had to choose
"options" 
and then tick off autoload images. Alas:
in the recent overbloated versions turning images off
is
quite a workload: for instance in M$IE explorer
was recently "View" &gt; "Internet
Options" &gt; "Advanced" and then finally you can tick
off the  "show pictures" box inside the  "Multimedia"
section. Clearly you would not want to perform all
these
operations just to avoid an advertisement banner,
would you?<bR>Of course for more serious anonymity you should use <a href="linux.htm">GNU/Linux</a> 
instead of windows (and download 
<a target=_top href="http://www.opera.com/download/">Opera for LINUX</a>.<br><br>


 <a target=_top href="http://www.opera.com/download/">Opera</a> offers even more advantages.
Try this other one: file => preferences (or simply press F12)...
see the checkbox 'enable GIF animation GIF'? Well... uncheck
it! Yep: you can selectively, page for page, or once for all, <font color=blue>kill those useless
animated gifs</font><br><br>

Nuff said. Try <a target=_top href="http://www.opera.com/download/">Opera</a> and decide by
yourself.
<br>
<br>
Note that there's
<font color=blue>NO REASON WHATSOEVER</font>
 to use the most recent version of a given software package,
and this is true ESPECIALLY for software that access the web.
<br>
<br>As you may read in

<br>As you begin to realize, it is quite useful to know exactly
what happens when
you start your browser... in fact, it is actually useful to know
what happens when you start ANY application.
You should proceed and learn to examine the file opening sequence
when you start a browser (and learn how to monitor files
activities) using filemonitors
like
Filemon, that you can download anywhere on the web (<font color=blue>filesrc.zip</font>)<br> Filemon has been written by  Mark Russinovich
& Bryce Cogswell,
the developers <i>inter alia</i> of
regmon,  @ <font color=blue>[</font><a target=_top href="http://www.sysinternals.com/">sysinternals</a><font
color=blue>]</font><br>They truly
deserve a "reversing Nobel".
   <br>I think that Opera is the best browser out there, and that the only possible alternative would be 
   <a target=_top href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Firefox</a>.
   But in order to have <a target=_top href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Firefox</a> work almost as 
   well as Opera, you will have to work heavily on its configuration. And Opera 
   is still quicker, hence "<font color=blue>the best</font>".
<br> This said, the point with a browser is
to understand that "best" is relative: <font color=blue>BEST FOR
WHAT</font>? <br>
      <br>

Best for a  old PC with limited memory?
           <br>
Best for your Ipaq or Palm?
  
        <br>
Best for handicapped users?<br>
   
Best for searching?<br>

Best for  security?<br>



Best  without a mouse?
<br>
Best for anonimity?

 A simple example:<br>
Try out <font color=blue>[</font><a

and it will not work. (Works from 7.20 onwards, though).
<br>
 
      <hr>   
             However the most annoying thing with <a target=_top href="http://www.opera.com/download/">Opera</a> is that it
is not OPEN SOURCE, it is not free
             software and it is not
             distributed under the <font color=blue>GNU   
licence</font>.  This could be a good reason,
             for purists, to use <a target=_top href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Firefox</a> instead. <br>
<br>
             Yet.<br>
             Since <a target=_top href="http://www.opera.com/download/">Opera</a> is <a target=_top href="http://tntluoma.com/opera/beyond30/2003/08/opera_vs_mozilla.
html">waay
             quicker than Firefox</a>
             (moreover <a target=_top href="http://www.opera.com/download/">Opera</a> gives you a great deal of control over what
information is given away in the first place, including referrer
logging and automatic redirection)
            
              and since we are not THAT pure after all, we will
stick with <a target=_top href="http://www.opera.com/download/">Opera</a>
             nevertheless :-)<br><br>
             Mozilla's <a target=_top href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Firefox</a>,  is 
             nevertheless a worthy possible choice, as
             ~S~  DQ pointed out:
             <b>firefox rules&#33;</b>&nbsp;
<br>"<font color=blue>Being a long time fan of <a target=_top href="http://www.opera.com/download/">Opera</a>, I decided to have a look at firefox.

<br>After beating the initial hurdle of finding my way though extensions and settings, 
I am now VERY confident that this is going to be the "next good thing" in my browsing experience.

 Of all the extensions I am currently playing with, I like 
<a target=_top href="http://adblock.mozdev.org/">the Adblock project</a> 
and <a target=_top href="http://copyurlplus.mozdev.org/customize.html">copyurlplus</a></font>"
<br>

             <br>
             Yet <a target=_top href="http://www.opera.com/download/">Opera</a> is waay <a target=_top href="http://www.howtocreate.co.uk/browserSpeed.html ">quicker</a> than <a target=_top href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Firefox</a><br><br>
             
             "Browser speed comparisons" (Quoting the conclusions, signalled by ronin): 


"<i>So overall, <a target=_top href="http://www.opera.com/download/">Opera</a> seems to be the fastest browser for windows. <a target=_top href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Firefox</a> is not faster than Internet Explorer, except for scripting, but for standards support, security and features, it is a better choice. However, it is still not as fast as Opera, and Opera also offers a high level of standards support, security and features. 
<br>
On Linux, Konqueror is the fastest for starting and viewing basic pages on KDE, but as soon as script or images are involved, or you want to use the back or forward buttons, or if you use Gnome, Opera is a faster choice, even though on KDE it will take a few seconds longer to start. 
Mozilla and <a target=_top href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Firefox</a> give an overall good performance, but their script, cache handling and image-based page speed still cannot compare with Opera. 
<br>
On Mac OS X, Opera and Safari are both very fast, with Safari 2 being faster at starting and rendering CSS, but with Opera still being distinguishably faster for rendering tables, scripting and history (especially compared with the much slower Safari 1.2). Camino is fast to start, but then it joins its sisters Mozilla and <a target=_top href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Firefox</a>
 further down the list. Neither Mozilla, <a target=_top href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Firefox</a> nor IE perform very well on Mac, being generally slower than on other operating systems. 
<br>
On Mac OS 9, no single browser stands out as the fastest. In fact, my condolences to anyone 
who has to use one of them, they all perform badly</I>"
             <br><br>
             An interesting site is Wee's <a target=_top href="http://firefoxopera.blogspot.com/2005/02/first-words.html">http://firefoxopera.blogspot.com/2005/02/first-words.html</a>:
             <br>"<font color=blue>As we'ld all know by now, <a target=_top href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Firefox</a> by itself is pretty much a minimal browser. Its true strength 
             for it to gain capabilities similar to that of Opera, including Mouse Gestures, Sessions, a more complete 
             Tabbed Browsing and even show you how to give your Firefox the Opera look.</font>"
             
             <br><br>
             Speaking of browsers, you can (and probably should) also try <a target=_top href="http://www.myie2.com/html_en/download.htm">MyIE2</a>, 
             a quick front end to MSIE that has tabs and moves through them with F2 and F3.
It does not beat <a target=_top href="http://www.opera.com/download/">Opera</a> in speed, of course, but it's actually surprising 
fast nevertheless... a sort of quick and lean MSIE, <font color=blue>MyIE2</font> is "MSIE as it should have been". 
You could use it as an alternative to <a target=_top href="http://www.opera.com/download/">Opera</a> whenever 
some crappy site requires MSIE.<br><br>Finally, a real surprise for newcomers is 
to discover how useful and quick a <font color=blue><b>NON GUI BROWSER</b></font> altrenative can be.
<bR>
Try <a href="http://elinks.or.cz/">elinks</a> and, if you are browsing to 
find information, as opposed to crap advertisements, you'll realize you are driving a rocket 
spaceship at lightspeed&nbsp;:-)
