A URL (Uniform Resource Location) is the mechanism used for Web addresses. 
URLs are used in Web browsers to find the location of a particular Web page. 
A URL consists of three main parts - the protocol, the host name, and 
the directory location. First comes the protocol.  This is usually "http" (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) or "ftp"
      (File Transfer Protocol). 
      The protocol comes first, followed by a colon and two slashes. In this 
      case it is using the HTTP protocol, which means a Web page is at that 
      location. The next portion is the Internet host name <font color=blue>www.searchlores.org</font>. 
      Somewhere on the Internet (here) is a system with that name, with a corresponding 
      IP numeric address provided by the Internet DNS service (see below). 
      The last portion is a specific document inside a directory structure, in this case <font color=blue>/milano/milano.htm</font>. Since 
      a Web server will typically have many different Web pages on multiple 
      directories, 
      the URL provides a way of specifying where to look.   <br>
      Remember that you  can almost always retrieve a page EVEN IF THE URL CHANGED, provided you use 
      an <font color=blue>exact portion of the text on that given page</font>.
      <br>Try for instance to retrieve this very page using 
       <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&as_qdr=all&q=%22A+URL+%28Uniform+Resource+Location%29+is+the+mechanism+used+for+Web+addresses.%22&btnG=Search">google</a>

Internet Protocols ~ IP</font>
</center><hr width=44%><font size=+1>
The most fundamental protocol is called IP, for 'Internet Protocol' (duh). 
On a network, the common term for a location is 'address', and each system 
on the Internet has an address. Since you are on the web right now, 
in order to read this, you are automatically a node of the web and you have 
an Address as well. You can check your actual address using your 
C:\Windows\Winipcfg.exe utility (if you run windoze). 
This 'IP address' has <u>many</U> possible formats, a often overlooked fact which is 
<a href="obscure.htm">quite relevant</a>  for seekers, as you'll understand in due time.<br> 
Internally, each computer system 
uses an IP address that is composed of four numbers, usually written for 
humans with dots between each number. An example IP numeric address is '<a href="http://209.103.174.104" target="_blank">209.103.174.104</a>' 
(an older IP address for my main site). However, since it's easier for humans 
to remember names instead of numbers, most IP addresses have corresponding 
names, also separated with dots. The previous address, written as a name corresponded to  
'<a href="http://www.searchlores.org" target="_blank">www.searchlores.org</a>'.<br><br> 
Scattered throughout the Internet are dedicated systems with the responsibility of 
translating Internet name addresses into the IP address numeric form. These 
systems are called 'name servers'. Another term used in conjunction with Internet 
name addresses is 'host name', because every Internet address must 
correspond to his hosting computer system somewhere on the Internet. 
The systems that provide IP name
 to number translation are called 'Domain Name Servers', or DNS.
 
 <br><br>   
 In windows there is a HOSTS file that represents your 'personal DNS server': before accessing any 
 remote computer through a name to address lookup, windows checks 
 the hosts file to see if the name has been defined as an address ALREADY in hosts.<br>
You can edit your HOSTS file in order to <a href="antiadve.htm#hosts">block annoying 
 advertisement</a>.

 </center>
<br><font size=+1>
 If you want to learn more about these things NOTHING can be better than RFCs. 
 The Internet Request For Comments (or RFC) documents are the    written definitions 
 of the protocols and policies of the Internet. 
 <br>In fact every aspect of the Internet is documented in these
  documents<br>
 RFCs are 
 usually in plain text form.<br>
 Once an RFC is published, it is not changed. However, it may be 
"obsoleted" by later work. Unfortunately, there is no easy way to 
"browse" RFCs to discover which RFC is the latest on a particular 
topic, although there are various Web Indexes which can be useful and
where you can use the server specific  form to 
 search for specific terms.<br><br>

<hr width=44%><font size=+1>
<IMG align=left valign=top width=9 height=40 SRC="images/dot_green.gif">One of 
the amazing characteristics (and probably advantages) 
of the Web is that it is not indexed in any standard 
manner. As a consequence retrieving 
information can seem difficult. Commercial search engines à la <a href="google.htm">google</a>, 
<a href="fast.htm">fast</a>, <a href="teoma.htm">teoma</a> or <a href="main.htm">altavista</a>, 
the most popular tools
for locating web pages, return a huge mass of
results, a general query risks to retrieve thousand of pages, many 
of them completely irrelevant, most of them quite off-topic. The problem is that you often enough get 
<font color=blue>too many results</font>.<bR>  
All search engines crawl the Web and log  in their databases 
all words from the
web pages they have gathered. Some search engines, like <a href="google.htm">google</a> or 
<A HREF="http://www.baidu.com/gaoji/advanced.html" target="_blank">baidu</a>, even mirror 
all pages in their cache, thus allowing you to find even '<a href="fu_speci.htm#disapp">disappeared' or "lost" pages</a>. These repositories, 
incidentally, make it almost impossible to "retire" something, once put on the web. 
I have conducted a personal experiment, trying to "pull" off the web 
my old, software reverse engineering oriented, site (that I have 'deprecated' :-) and 
found it next to impossible. In fact, once you publish something on the web, if  it has some original content, or
if it is 
of some interest, "<font color=blue>it goes forth 
and multiplies</font>".<bR>Back to the crawling search engines with terabytes of 
compressed texts: 
Once you start logging words from hundred of millions of pages the 
results of an (unstructured or "simpleton") query can be overwhelming.<bR> 
Without searching knowledge, 
and without a clear strategy, 
using a search engine is like wandering aimlessly in the dark, without 
spectacles and light, in the stacks of
a poorly organized library trying to find a particular book. 
<bR><bR><font color=blue>A good Seeker's supper should not smell too much</font>.<bR>  
See, the problem is not only <u>how to find</u>, your info, but also  and foremost, 
how to <u>evaluate</u> it. Imagine your search will give  you "only" 200 
- possibly 
valuable - results. That's way too many for effective human evaluation purposes.<br>Let us quickly 
demonstrate this: 
let's say you have a good "zen" perception and it takes you just 
half a minute to quickly "diagonally scan" a 
page with your eyes~brain to "feel" if it is worth keeping~reading or not... that 
makes 100 minutes for that single query! More than one and a half hours smelling possibly stale  
pages! Clearly that's not  a 
very effective searching approach.  For this very reason you should master some techniques that will allow you 
to     <font color=blue>drastically reduce</font> the 
number of fishes you'll have to smell before choosing the ingredients for 
your seeker's supper.
 <br><br>
Robot-driven search engines can be defined as search engines which
use
a bot (aka "spider", "worm", "wanderer" or "crawler") to
automatically collect sites for their index. They are different
from
subject directories/trees which are hierarchical and rely on
people
to add sites to their index.  No search engine can actually cope
with the exponential growth of the web. The best engines
(<a href="google.htm">google</a>, 
<a href="fast.htm">fast</a> and <a href="teoma.htm">teoma</a>) cover actually less than 20% of the texts, images,
programs and sounds present on the web. You'll
have to use advanced searching techniques like <a href="bots.htm">your 
own bot writing</a>,     <a href="local.htm">local digging</a>
<a href="regional.htm">going regional</a>, <a href="combing.htm">combing</a>, 
<a href="luring.htm">luring</a> and <font color=blue>klebing</font> to (try to)
get at the remaining 90%.<br> <br>The <a href="main.htm">main</a> search engines are in fact not
following 
"uncharted" links any more: the task of keeping the links
they already have gathered UPDATED 
is difficult enough (as the many <a href="errors.htm">404</a> you'll encounter testify).<br>
They now spider only 
"on submission".
<br><bR> This said you should by all means still use the <a href="main.htm">main</a> search engines 
(which in average overlap only for 50% of their coverage, therefore you may well 
find on one engine something that another engine does not show).<bR>Be aware of the algos 
they use (highly variable from engine to engine, as explained in detail elsewhere on my site): 
mostly based on common parameters. For keywords occurrence, for instance:<ul><lI>
Order of appearance of keyword terms</lI>
<lI>frequency of keyword</li>
<lI>keyword in title and metatags</lI>
<li>funny or rare keywords</lI>
</uL> Take however account of the fact that
all main search engines are <font color=blue>purposely spammed</font> through the
many
tricks used to "get on the top positions", which -once more- depend from the
specific
algorithms used on each search engine. The most common spamming techniques are:<uL><li>Overuse
or repetition of keywords </li><li> Use of keywords that do not relate to
the content of the site
</li><li>Use of fast meta refresh
</li><li>Use of coloured text on same-color background (a very old trick) </li><li>
Duplication of pages with different URLs </li><li>
Use of different pages that bridge to the same URL</li>
<li>
Creation of dynamic pages on the fly as answer to your search (one of the worst spammingtechniques)</li></ul>
 <br>This -for  many
"broad" queries - means 
that people should actually simply JUMP the first twenty-thirty occurrences of 
results (SERPs) 
and start the results' evaluation directly from page 4 downwards :-)<bR><br>
Note also - moreover - that all <a href="main.htm">main</a> search engines are now beginning  
to sell "slots" and to allow some "jolly" answers -based on whatever query you have made- 
to figure in the SERPs, thus pushing
some sites on the first positions.  One reason more to jump to
page 3 or 4: screw commercial spammers and faked algos.<br>
Finally, never forget that the very reason for having someone SETTING UP a search
engine "for free"  (<i>sic</i>)  is
to log ALL your queries <font color=blue>in order to sell 
such data</font> to third parties (see <font color=blue>[</font><a href="seamara2.htm">seamara2.htm</a><font color=blue>]</font>). Therefore
you should <u>by all means</u>
be quite concerned with all sorts of <a href="noanon.htm">anonymity matters</a> and <a href="nemo_SEO.htm">counter
measures</a>.

 <IMG align=left valign=top width=9 height=40 SRC="images/dot_green.gif"> 
You can and will learn to use effectively the various search tools on the web, 
but don't forget that the most important part of searching for information 
happens before you even get online.<br> 
It helps a lot to know which tool to use when, 
and that all depends on what kind of question you're 
asking or what type of information you're looking for.<bR>
I mean the "when" <u>literally</u>: the time of the day can affect 
results. It is often useful to avoid intensive searches when euroamericans 
are 
<font color=blue>[</font><a href="http://static.spiritweb.org/CGI/sunclock.cgi">awake</a><font color=blue>]</font>.
<br><br><center>Normal/Advanced inconsistencies & quircks</center><br>  
Remember also that most search engines have a "normal" and an "advanced" search mask, 
and that the "advanced" search mask gives DIFFERENT RESULTS vis-à-vis the normal one.<bR>
If you try an altavista query for <font color=blue>+how to search +hints</fonT> on 
the <font color=blue>[</font><a href="http://www.altavista.com/cgi-bin/query?sc=on&hl=on&kl=XX&pg=q&enc=iso88591&text=yes&q=%2B%22how+to+search%22+%2Bhints&search=Search">normal</a><font color=blue>]</font> 
 
 form you'll get 1999 pages (September 00), if you try the same query 
on the 
<font color=blue>[</font><a href="http://www.altavista.com/cgi-bin/query?hl=on&q=%2B%22how+to+search%22+%2Bhints&search=Search&r=&kl=XX&pg=aq&text=yes&d0=&d1=">advanced</a><font color=blue>]</font> form 
and you'll get only two!<bR>Note that search engines quirks will give you eight pages on the advanced form 
if you invert the querystring to 
<font color=blue>[</font><a href="http://www.altavista.com/cgi-bin/query?hl=on&q=%2Bhints+%2B%22how+to+search%22+&search=Search&r=&kl=XX&stype=&pg=aq&text=yes&d0=31%2F12%2F96&d1=">+hints +"how to search"</a><font color=blue>]</font>, 
a 400% difference for the 'advanced' form that does not correspond on the normal page: <font color=blue>[</font><a href="http://www.altavista.com/cgi-bin/query?sc=on&hl=on&kl=XX&pg=q&enc=iso88591&text=yes&q=%2Bhints+%2B%22how+to+search%22&search=Search">+hints +"how to search"</a><font color=blue>]</font> where 
with this chiasmatic inversion you'll get  just the same pages as before.<br> 
<bR><bR> <center>directories and search engines</center><br>  
As almost everyone knows, there are two main (and quite different) search tools on the web: directories and search engines. Directories like 
<font color=blue>[</font><a href="http://www.yahoo.com">yahoo</a><font color=blue>]</font>, 
<font color=blue>[</font><a href="http://www.dmoz.com">Open directory</a><font color=blue>]</font> and 
<font color=blue>[</font><a href="http://www.looksmart.com">LookSmart</a><font color=blue>]</font> are CATEGORIZED lists, with brief descriptions of 
the sites. categories are based on submissions by web site owners, which are edited by 
more or less capable, mostly volunteer editors. Directories are good when you want prompts to 
guide you towards your signal, or when you want 
to go on a surf trip... when you need a specific information quickly you'll be better off 
with a search engine. See: Modern search engines index ALL words on the pages they register, 
and are therefore <u>very useful</u> if you know how to squeeze what you need out of the noise.
<br>Let's seek this very page on fast/alltheweb... let's choose -purposely- a very RARE sequence of words, that I have written 10 lines above... you'll immediately see 
how this page will jump out of a billion sites&nbsp;:-)<br>
<a href="http://www.ussc.alltheweb.com/cgi-bin/search?type=all&query=%22where+with+this+chiasmatic+inversion+you%27ll+get%22&exec=FAST+Search">"where with this chiasmatic inversion you'll get"</a>
<br>The same works with google as well...<br>
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=30&meta=hl%3D%26lr%3D&q=%22where+with+this+chiasmatic+inversion+you%27ll+get%22">"where with this chiasmatic inversion you'll get"</a>
<br>
The reason you should choose a RARE sequence of words is obvious. The web is the contarry of a library: 
the more rare and esoteric your quarry, the more easy it is to find it. Spelling mistakes are 
an added bonus: "you will get" will give you millions of pages, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22you+woll+get%22&num=30&safe=off&btnG=Google+Search">"you woll get"</a> will give you only one 
page (one at the time of writing this... probably two by the time this page will be indexed anew).

<br><br>Of course directories and search engines are by no means the only options you have for 
searching your quarries.<bR>
 You should choose your search 
tools "categorizing your question":. 
<bR>
<font color=blue>Broad Topic</fonT><bR>

 Usenet searches   + messageboard searches + maillists

<br><br>
Always remember: Before plunging into the interesting (and 
often startling) world of web searching, 
ask yourself "Could someone have already done this work for me?"
<font color=blue>[</font><a href="combing.htm">Combing</a><font color=blue>]</font>, i.e. searching - <i>inter alia</i> - people that 
have already searched the very information you are seeking, can give 
extremely interesting results. Messageboards, private pages and 
the whole usenet world are the seas you'll <a href="trolls.htm">troll</a> around when combing. In 
same cases the troll is meant in its REAL sense, read the 
<font color=blue>[</font><a href="http://www.altairiv.demon.co.uk/troll/trollfaq.html">trolling 
FAQ</a><font color=blue>]</font> if 
you don't know that <font color=blue>a 
troll</font> is simply <font color=blue>a posting on 
Usenet or on any messageboard designed to attract predictable responses</font>. And this can in some cases be used to gain some extra-knowledge: see the ad hoc 
<font color=blue>[</font><a href="trolls.htm">trolls page</a><font color=blue>]</font> if you are interested.

color=blue>Focusing on specific needs</fonT></fonT></center><hr width=44%><font
size=+1>
<IMG align=left valign=top width=9 height=40 SRC="images/dot_green.gif">The best 
way to look at Internet resources is through the focus of specific 
needs. Otherwise, you can spend a lifetime drifting through archipelagos of fascinating, 
but ultimately fruitless links.<br>
A good rule of thumb is that if <font color=blue>in less 
than 15 minutes</fonT> you don't at least <u>approach</u> what you are searching for, 
you better revise your search_strategy.<br>
So "approaching" needs a definition.<br>
A search session can be divided in 5 phases:<ul><li>
Preparation (layout of the search strategy)</li><li>
Start (or "broad") phase (signal weak)</li><li>
Refining (main corrections)</li><li>
Approaching (small corrections: signal very strong)</li><li>
Closing in (the last efforts, no more noise on the signal)</li></uL>
With the "Dah-daa! Bingo I found my target!" as ultimate aim, of course.<bR>
Each of these phases has specific characteristics and needs specific knowledge, 
that I  try to explain elsewhere on this site.<bR>
Yet there are some "global" parameters that are valuable for ALL phases, the 
most important one being, possibly, the capacity to remain "on track" during 
your session.<br>
Once more, as Sielaff said long ago about footnotes and bibliography: 
"<font color=blue>Focus always on your specific 
needs. Otherwise, you can spend a lifetime drifting through archipelagos of fascinating, 
but ultimately fruitless links</fonT>". I don't need to underline how true this is for Internet 
searching as well...<bR> 
Imagine yourself as a 'blade', cutting through million of useless "pudding sites"  
to find the few "rosinen" you are looking for. <font color=blue>DO NOT GO ASTRAY</font>! 
If you are looking for -say- 
some scripts in rebol that you badly need to ameliorate your own web searching bots 
you SHOULD NOT stop in order to 
read some fascinating info about IRC-bots,<ul><li> 
even if you never saw anything as good elsewhere about this subject</li><li>
 even if these techniques could 
(eventually) be of some 
use, </lI><li>even if you are genuinely interested in that stuff. </li></ul>
The above reasons do not matter!<br>Do  not listen to 
Sirens: they are 
luring you in order to crush your search vessel 
onto the Scylla & Charybdis of all searchers!<bR>For crying out loud: wake up!  
YOU ARE NOT searching for 
IRC-bots, you are searching for rebol-scripts! Write your task in 
big red letters on a yellow "post-it" and 
stick it in the middle of your screen (next to the counter that is 
counting down your 15 minutes maximal allowed search time&nbsp;:-)<br>
This is more important than most newbies seekers believe. <br>The problem is that surfing and browsing the internet 
is quite seductive. You continue to find tidbits of interest. In fact, no matter 
how accurate your query was, a significant percentage of the search results you will obtain 
will not correspond to what you were looking for. Oh, you'll get results 
fairly quickly, the real time-wasting problem is the document review phase. 
This is the reason you should <font color=blue>spend more 
time on the query formulation</font>, you'll gain 
MUCH MORE time sparing it during the results evaluation phase. We'll together see how you 
can automate part of the evaluation task (thus sparing a huge amount of time).
<bR>Admittedly it can be 
 at times quite interesting, from a seeker's point of view, to investigate WHY you did 
get some queer results (one of the assignments inside <font color=blue>[</font><a href="lab1.htm">lab1</a><font color=blue>]</font> 
requires you to search for a latin sentence, a specific search that 
usually gives some "funny" results), but in general you should imagine 
yourself (and your browservessel)
as a sharp "blade"  cutting through sites rather than as a lazy butterfly surfer drifting 
from link to link.
