Removing banners and pop up's
<br><bR>
Well this time the purpose of this essay is not to teach you a great reversing 
lesson, because the protection of this program took me 5 minutes
To remove, but to introduce you to download this great program.
The link : <a href="https://searchlores.nickifaulk.com/www.intercantech.com">www.intercantech.com</a>
It simply removes all the adds and annoying pop up windows when you surf, 
and it works on m$ie and opera !
<br><bR>
I invite you to download it (adsOff), remove the protection and then <u>pay</u> 
for this great program, they need a reward for a great effort!
<br><bR>
Tools needed : Softice 3.2x<br>
An ugly web page full of ads and pop ups, like the ones you find when 
you search smut sites' protections, or even when you go to my own fravia 
mirror. My poor mirror is victim of a pop up window on every page !
And if I am too lazy to prepare an ad hoc javascript to remove it... well this program 
will remove it by itself.
<br><bR>
Lets's start :
<br><bR>
Try to register, bpx to messageboxa, you land just after the call.
<br><bR>
Look up, you will find at<bR>
402d20 Jnz 402d8d *Bad guy.
<br><bR>
Well just nop this  silly jnz and that's it: target is regged and fully fonctioning.<bR>
When you'll start it again, it will not even  check that the pass you gave was 
bad, it must have written a registered flag somewhere...<bR>
(a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=%22most+stupid+protection%22+fravia&num=10&hl=en&ie=ISO-8859-1&btnG=Google+Search&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&lr=&as_ft=i&as_filetype=&as_qdr=all&as_occt=any&as_dt=i&as_sitesearch=&safe=off">most stupid</a> protection, in fact).
<br><bR>

The major purpose of this essay is NOT to give you a cracked little program: it is 
to beg you to spread this link (and target) to 
all your friends, after having used it. In my opinion 
anyone should use this program! I sincerely hope that 
his programmer will get at least a part of the registration money he deserves, 
even if I fear that many will not pay for it, I'm sure that the simple fact 
of spreading it all over the web will increase its popularity quite a lot!
Imagine if everyone had this prog, the web could change considerably!
<br><bR>
See ya !
