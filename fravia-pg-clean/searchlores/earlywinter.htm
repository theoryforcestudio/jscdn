<br> <font size=+3>T</font><font size=+1>he two images on the left represent a (small & old) wooden board game 
I found last weekend, second
hand, for just 1 euro 20 cents :-) &nbsp;  
That pencil gives you its real dimensions. Look at the cute <a href="rabbits.htm">webbits</a>&nbsp;:-)<br><br>
</font>
<font size=+3>A</font><font size=+1>s you can see, there are three 'white' and three 'black' wooden figures on a 
'seven cases ladder'. No instructions whatsoever where provided. 
 <br> 
Yep: these figures look like 'Rabbits' or 'Hare', 'Hasen', 'Lepri', 'Lapins' etc., so -I desumed- they are probably 
supposed to 
spring over each other... along those 'seven steps' ladder.  
It wasn't easy (for me) to find 'the solution' on the web. 
Therefore I thought that this could be of some interest for fellow seekers (caveat: usually when I think something 
is 
hard to find, is just that I'm not very good at it, and usually much too many readers point 
out how really easy it was instead). How would you start describing this for your searches? What strings would you use in order 
to try to find this on the web?<br><br>
</font>
<font size=+3>S</font><font size=+1>o, to summarize: What is this game? 
How are you supposed to play it? What's the aim of it? How many players? One or Two? 
Should players go through the seven cases ladder and 
will the first to 'exit on the other side' win? Should you move or jump? Or both? 
As you'll see it is not easy, even for a seeker, 
to find the 'rules and the name of the game' on our deep, deep (and full of crap) web.
