Born on 30 August 1952 in Oulu, on the Botnian Gulf, 
(Suomi-Finland), first of two children:  
his younger sister Silja was to become 
one of the most distinguished painters of the Tampere  
lagoons.  
<br>
His father Gunnar, a famous Finnish poet, published the 
well known collections "Sekasointuja" 
and "Uusia Säkenijä" and fought with the 
reds as "Sissiluutnantti Ravia" 
(partisan lieutenant Ravia) against the nazi of Von Falkenhorst. Fjalar's mother
Anu, a very capable teacher,   
was one of the first Scandinavian women having crossed 
the Atlantic on a hydroplane in the forties. 
<br><br>
He studied applied software entomology at the Savonlinna 
University and graduated with the paper &quot;<i>How to reverse 
engineer, and eventually smash, software bugs</i>&quot;, published 
in the prestigious &quot;students' essays&quot; of the 
University of 
Helsinki. He later studied  <a href="images/MGH_tisch.jpg">history 
of the early middle ages</a> and rhetoric, in Berlin, under the teachings 
of one of the greatest university mentors Europe has had 
in the last century: Dr Frithjof Sielaff.
<br><br>
His hobbies and extra-professional activities 
vary: web-publishing (on <a href="http://www.searchlore.org">http://searchlore.org</a>); 
software reverse 
engineering and <a href="protec/protec.htm">protections matters</a>; <a href="antiadve.htm">anti-advertisement</a> activities; <a href="realicra/realicra.htm">reality cracking</a> 
and finally beer-tasting (Belgian beers<a href="io13.htm#ename">&#185</a> of course).
<br>He enjoys 
games. Board games with strategical content (chess and all 
<a href="http://www.alltheweb.com/search?advanced=1&cat=web&cs=iso-8859-1&type=phrase&q=%22alex+randolph%22&jsact=&l=pref&ics=iso-8859-1&cs=iso-8859-1&wf%5Bn%5D=3&wf%5B0%5D%5Br%5D=%2B&wf%5B0%5D%5Bq%5D=&wf%5B0%5D%5Bw%5D=&wf%5B1%5D%5Br%5D=-&wf%5B1%5D%5Bq%5D=&wf%5B1%5D%5Bw%5D=&wf%5B2%5D%5Br%5D=&wf%5B2%5D%5Bq%5D=&wf%5B2%5D%5Bw%5D=&dincl=&dexcl=&geo=&limip=&doctype=&dfr%5Bd%5D=1&dfr%5Bm%5D=1&dfr%5By%5D=1980&dto%5Bd%5D=19&dto%5Bm%5D=2&dto%5By%5D=2003&size%5Bp%5D=%3D&size%5Bv%5D=&size%5Bx%5D=0&depth%5Bp%5D=%3E&depth%5Bv%5D=&hits=10&nooc=on">Alex Randolph</a>'s 
games<a href="io13.htm#robot">&#178</a>), but also software games, for instance 
the unforgettable Steel 
panther series<a href="io13.htm#steel">&#179</a> (not to speak of the even better 'combat mission' series, with their 
incredible tactical<a href="io13.htm#comi">*</a> 
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&as_qdr=all&q=%22combat+mission%22+infantry+tanks+tiger&btnG=Google+Search">depth</a>).
<br><br> 
He hears classical music (Monteverdi, Vivaldi, Mahler and Katschaturian); yet his 
favorite 
activities (bar sailing around Greece 
 with his small old and sturdy teak-<a href="http://www.searchlores.org/images/vertuelepa1.jpg">vertue</a>&nbsp;:-) are by 
far &quot;semantical reversing&quot; and &quot;practical rhetoric&quot;. 
He spends part of his holidays -almost every year- in 
Venice (Italy), a city 
that he loves (there are no cars) and hates (there are too many 
Italians with a GSM screwed to their heads and much too many tourists).
<br><br>
One of his most peculiar endowments is the capacity of 
NON watching for months any TV at all.
<br><br>
He works and lives in the European Union with his 
beloved wife 
Annele, his 
daughter Franziska, the twins 
Alvi and Sirkka, his books, his beers  
and a 
lot of bikes.<br></font>

was developed by fravia+ in 1980 (on a different topological board) and the idea was passed 
(as a present)   
to Alex in 1991.

&#179) You'll be able to find an incredible quantity of very good games, of course for free, if you follow 
the paths of the "<a href="http://s.teoma.com/search?q=abandonware&qcat=1&qsrc=1&submit.x=36&submit.y=7">Abandonedwares</a>". For instance the 
complete Steel Panthers 2 version.
 Many have worked hard in order to port these strategical marvels to the latest windoze 
 systems. <a href="http://www.matrixgames.com/games/WorldAtWar/features.asp">Here</a> 
 and <a href="http://www.wargamer.com/spcammo/">here</a> 
 you'll be able to find, for free, the latest versions, and while playing and wasting 
many  months - you have been warned - 
 on these strategical and tactical marvels, 
 you may be tempted to apply some sound <a href="http://all.net/books/tzu/tzu.html">theory</a>!&nbsp;:-)

   *)   
       CMBO, CMBB and CMAK are now out, all three have <a href="http://www.battlefront.com/">demos</a> that you can play in order to try them out, 
       and I am sure you'll enjoy the <a href="http://www.battlefront.com/discuss/ultimatebb.php?ubb=forum;f=23">tactical depth</a> and the many 
       <a href="http://www.dragonlair.net/combatmission/">scenarios</a>. 
       Anyway CMBO, the older one of the trilogy can 
be VERY easily  found on the web.
