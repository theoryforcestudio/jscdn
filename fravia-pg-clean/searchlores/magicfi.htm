<p>There are many ways to get registered software.&nbsp; You can buy it, you can get a
copy from a friend or from the internet, you can crack a demo, you can use a serial
number, etc.&nbsp; There are so many ways that if you really want something, you can get
it.</p><p><br>
I have noticed that many ActiveX controls are updated frequently.&nbsp; For example,
DataDynamics has been posting a new update for ActiveReports every two weeks.&nbsp; If you
get a pirated copy or a patch, then you never really have the most recent version.
&nbsp; That's why I prefer licensing my software.&nbsp; And that's what my essays are
about: licensing, not cracking software.<br><br>
I have already talked about a couple of ways to get licensed.&nbsp; There is another way
that I am starting to use more and more.&nbsp; That is to hack the company's web site.
There are may ways to find info on the company's website.&nbsp; Here are some methods that
I use:<br><br>
-&nbsp; Browse their FTP site looking for hidden directories<br>
-&nbsp; Browse their FTP site looking for stuff out in the open that they have forgotten
about<br>
-&nbsp; Use a FrontPage attack (there are many)<br>
-&nbsp; Exploit weaknesses in Active Server Pages<br>
-&nbsp; View the source of pages (especially registering and purchasing online pages)<br>
-&nbsp; And my favorite:&nbsp; Guessing<br><br>
I can't believe how many sites I have hacked just by guessing stuff.&nbsp; As I mentioned
before I got all of the Winternals Software just by guessing the URL's.&nbsp; I got a
password for a protoview install by typing random keys (I heard someone else had done the
same thing).&nbsp; I have found serial number lists, serial number generators and
validators, and user registrations.<br><br>
It's all there for the taking.&nbsp; The trick is to be really good at guessing.&nbsp; The
principle here is that people are predictable.&nbsp; If someone thinks a certain way one
day, most likely they are going to think the same way the next day.&nbsp; Also, people are
usually going to name things with the first thing that comes to mind. <br><br>
For example, if you wanted to created a directory for downloads, what would you call that
directory?&nbsp; And then if you have one directory for demos, what would you call the
directory for retail products?<br><br>
Do see my point?&nbsp; The Amazing Kreskin works on this principle.&nbsp; He asks people
to think of a vegetable and most people will think of a carrot.&nbsp; He asks them to
think of a shape then to think of another shape inside that shape and most of the time he
knows what they are thinking.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because people are predictable.<br><br>
How many new computer users do you think use their logon as their password?&nbsp; Many.
&nbsp; And why do you think there are so many common password lists on hacking sites?
&nbsp; Because a lot of people use these common passwords.&nbsp; See? They are
predictable.<br><br>
Now if a company has a product named ERD Commander and the information about that product
is on a page called erdcmndr.htm and the demo is named<br>
erdcmndr.exe in the demos directory then what do you think the real product is going to be
called?&nbsp; Yep, erdcmndr.exe (in a different directory, of course).&nbsp; <br><br>
To get the real version of ERD Commander I looked at the demo at www.sysinternals.com then
went to their retail site, <a target=_top  href="http://www.winternals.com" >www.winternals.com</a> and
downloaded erdcmdr.exe.&nbsp; Of course, I first had to find the download directory, but
that's another story.<br><br>
And guess what? I just repeated that same process for all of their products.
&nbsp; Remember what I said?&nbsp; If someone thinks a certain way one day, most likely
they are going to think the same way the next day. People are predictable.<br><br>
Here's another one:&nbsp; Suppose a company has a Web page that allows you to register
their software online.&nbsp; It is called regonline.htm.&nbsp; And let's suppose they are
using IIS on Windows NT.&nbsp; And let's suppose they want all these online registrations
to be saved to a text file.&nbsp; What would that file be named and where would it be
located?&nbsp; These would be my first guesses for www.company.com/regonline.htm:<br><br>
www.company.com/regonline.txt<br>
www.company.com/_private/regonline.txt<br>
www.company.com/_vti_pvt/regonline.txt<br><br>
Here's another one, Janus Systems has a page to register online in the
http://www.janusys.com/Support/ directory.&nbsp; These registrations post to a<br>
text file.&nbsp; Now if your customers were registering their software and these
registrations post to a text file and your company is in Mexico,<br>
what would you call this text file?<br><br>
My guesses would be:<br>
www.janusys.com/support/registration.txt<br>
www.janusys.com/support/register.txt<br>
www.janusys.com/support/registracion.txt<br>
www.janusys.com/support/registra.txt<br><br>
And you know what? It's the last one (at least it used to be before I first posted this
essay on my mailing list)<br><br>
The key to guessing is research.&nbsp; Look around at their website and see what they name
things and where they put things.&nbsp; Look at pictures and links and downloads.&nbsp; Do
they like cryptic abbreviations? Is there a method that uses the product version number?
&nbsp; Do you see patterns?<br><br>
Then, just guess.&nbsp; You would be surprised how many times this works.&nbsp; That is,
if you have really mastered the art of guessing.<br></p>

Have a hunch, will guess | paypal 's your pal | images name guessing</center></tD></tr></table></center>
<br><br>Granted: 
guessing can be boring, and should almost always be used as last resort... as <i>ultima ratio quaerentis</i>. This method, even using 
a good list (or hunch) of probable names, will in fact work successfully only in few cases... probably just one or two out of ten attempts. 
<br>But this method is sound, because it is based on the very structure of our web, a structure that was MADE for sharing (and not for 
selling, thanks Godzilla). Much will depend from your nose and your web-experience.
<bR><br>
What is sure, is that this approach  
works better if you already have a hunch!<br>The following will work for software or music as well (in fact for 
almost any target you could be looking for), but let's 
make now an example of guessing regarding <a href="images.htm">images</a>.<br>
Let's say you discover a site where photos have been stored and collected. Alas 
not with the aim of spreading them to anyone for free, but -as unfortunately often happens on the commercial polluted web, 
with the shockingly repellent (quite macabre) intent to "sell" them. 
<br><br>Ok, you found the image you wanted applying our well-known <a href="images.htm">image searching techniques</a>. But 
the image is crippled, or tagged with awful watermarks, or much too small.<bR><br> 
Often the commercial bastards let visitors see -as bait- 
only the smallest versions of the photos they host, or only images impaired by 
watermarks, patents and tags, or only low resolution photos... preposterously pretending "money" to show you bigger versions 
(or uncrippled and untagged versions). <bR><br>

HEIGHT="40">&nbsp;</td><td>
<div align="center">
<font  color="#0000FF" size=+2>Paypal's your pal&nbsp;:-)</font><br><br>
Well, if they use paypal to deliver the goodies, there might be no need to guess at all.<br> 
Whenever you see a paypal payment option for your target (music, software, books, you name it), 
<u>check at once the page source code</u>!<br>If  they 
<u>don't use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_Payment_Notification">IPN</a></u>, or other third-party processing services, 
you will often see in the source code of the page the line <br><font  color="#0000FF">INPUT TYPE=HIDDEN 
&nbsp;&nbsp; NAME="return" &nbsp;&nbsp; VALUE=</font>
<br>If that's the 
case, <u>rejoice aloud ye seekers, rejoice!</u><br> What follows after 
<font  color="#0000FF">VALUE=</font> will be the address of
the download page of your target... <br>...as easy as palpie.</div>

<br>
Back to our guessing lore: if your crippled target image 
happens to have -say- a name like <font  color="#0000FF">BMPD_03884_0048601T.JPG</font>, 
what would you do?
<br>
For instance: <a target=_top href="http://media3.adforum.com/zrIf58670C/B/BM/BMPD_03884/BMPD_03884_0048601T.JPG">http://media3.adforum.com/zrIf58670C/B/BM/BMPD_03884/BMPD_03884_0048601T.JPG</a>, 
   an English Volkswagen advertisement.<br><br>
   Alas, the clowns are not a free knowledge site. Let's see what we can do.<br>
    <a target=_top href="http://media3.adforum.com/zrIf58670C/B/BM/BMPD_03884/BMPD_03884_0048601T.JPG">Let's isolate the image</a>, and now 
    let's play the guessing game, because we don't really want to [shudder] pay advertisers in order to see 
    their crap, do we? <br>Now we notice that <font color=blue>BMPD_03884_0048601T.JPG</fonT> has a "t" inside. 
Could it be a "t" for "tiny"? <br>And if so... could we have maybe a "w" for "wide" and maybe also an "a" for "art", or maybe "all" or 
"amazing"... who knows? Who cares? Just try the letter/guessing game in such cases&nbsp;:-)
<br>
    (<a target=_top href="http://media3.adforum.com/zrIf58670C/B/BM/BMPD_03884/BMPD_03884_0048601W.JPG">http://media3.adforum.com/zrIf58670C/B/BM/BMPD_03884/BMPD_03884_0048601W.JPG</a>...see?
     <a target=_top href="http://media3.adforum.com/zrIf58670C/B/BM/BMPD_03884/BMPD_03884_0048601A.JPG">http://media3.adforum.com/zrIf58670C/B/BM/BMPD_03884/BMPD_03884_0048601AJPG</a>...
