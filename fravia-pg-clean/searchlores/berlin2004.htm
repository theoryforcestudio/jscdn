  This document is listing a palette of possible points to be discussed is <a href="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=fravia&num=100">my</a> own  
   <i>in fieri</i>  contribution to the <a href="http://www.ccc.de/congress/2004/?language=en">21C3 ccc's event</a>  (December 2004, Berlin).
   The aim of this workshop  is to give European hackers some  "cosmic" searching power, because they will need it badly when  (and if) they 
   will wage battle against the powers that be.
   
   <br><br>
   The ccc-friends  in Berlin have insisted on a "paper" to be presented before the workshop, 
   which isn't easy, since a lot of content may depend on the kind of audience I'll  find: you never 
   know, before, how much web-savvy (or clueless)  the participants will be...  usually 
   you just realize it during (or after) a session.<br><br>
   Hopefully, a European hacker congress will allow some  (more) complex searching techniques to 
   be discussed. Anyway the 
   real workshop will probably differ a lot from this  list of points, techniques and aspects of web-searching 
   that need to be explained -again and again- if we want   
   people to understand that seeking encompasses MUCH MORE than just using 
   the main search engines � la <a href="google.htm">google</a>,   
   <a href="fast.htm">fast</a> or <a href="inktomi.htm">inktomi</a> with "one-word" simple queries.  <br><br>
   I have kept this document on a rather schematic plane:  readers will at least be able 
   to  read 
   this file before the workshop itself,which may prove useful: in fact  there are various things to digest even during 
   such a short session, and many lore will remain uncovered.
   <br><br> 
   The aim is anyway to <font color=blue>point readers towards non-commercial working approaches and possible solutions</font>; above all, to enable them  to find 
   more (sound) material by themselves on the deep web of knowledge.<br>
   <font color=blue>If you learn to search the web well, you won't need nobody's workshops anymore</font>&nbsp;:-)

<font size=+3>  Introduction
</font>  <br><hr width=85%><br>  




<font size=+1>    
 <i>
 I'll try my best, today, to give you some <font color=blue>cosmic power</font>. And I mean this "im ernst". <br>
 In fact <font color=blue>everything</font> (that can be digitized) is on the web, albeit often 
 buried under tons of commercial crap. And if you are able to find, for free, whatever you're looking for, you have considerable power.<br>
 The amount of information you can now gather on the web is truly staggering.<br>
Let's see... how many fairy tales do you think human beings have ever written since the dawn of human culture? <br>
How many songs has our race sung? <br>
How many pictures have humans drawn? <br>
How many books in how many languages have been drafted and published on our planet?
<br><br>
  The Web is deep! "<font color=blue>While I am counting to five</font>" hundredthousands of new images, books, musics and software programs 
  will be uploaded on the web (...and <font color=blue>millions</font> will be downloaded :-) ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE<br>
The mind shudders, eh?  

<br><br>
The knowledge of the human race is at your disposal! 
<br>It is there for the take! Every book, picture, film, document, newspaper that has been written, 
painted, created by the human race is out there somewhere <i>in extenso</i>, with some exceptions that only confirm this rule. 
<br>
But there are even more important goodies than "media products" out there. 
<br>On the web there are <font color=blue>SOLUTIONS</font>! WORKING solutions! Imagine you are confronted with some task, imagine 
 you have 
to solve a software or configuration problem in your laptop, for instance, or you have to defend yourself from
 some  authority's wrongdoing, say you want to stop those noisy planes 
flying over your town... simply imagine you are seeking <font color=blue>a solution</font>, doesn't matter a solution to what, 
�a c'est �gale.
<br><br>
Well, you can bet: the solution to your task or problem is there on the web, somewhere. 
<br>Actually you'll probably find MORE THAN ONE solution to your current problem, and maybe you'll be later able to build 
on what you'll have found, collate the different solutions and even develop another, different, approach, that will afterwards be on the web as well. For ever.
<br>
The web was made FOR SHARING knowledge, <u>not for selling nor for hoarding it</u>, and despite the heavy commercialisation of the 
web, its very STRUCTURE is -still- a structure for sharing. That's the reason seekers can always find <font color=blue>whatever</font> they want, 
<font color=blue>wherever</font> it may have been placed or hidden. 
Incidentally that is also the reason why no database on earth will ever be able to deny us entry :-)              

<br> <br>
Once you learn how to search the web, how to find quickly what you are looking for and -quite important- how to <font color=blue>evaluate</font> the results 
of your queries, you'll de facto grow as different from the rest of the human beings as cro-magnon and neanderthal were once upon a time. 
<br>"The rest of the human beings"... you know... those guys that happily use microsoft explorer as a browser, 
enjoy useless flash presentations, browse drowning among pop up windows, surf without any proxies whatsoever and 
hence smear all their personal data around gathering all possible nasty spywares and trojans on the way. 
                     <br> <br>
I am confident that many among you will gain, at the end of this lecture, either a good understanding 
of some effective web-searching techniques or, at least (and that amounts to the same in my eyes), the capacity to 
FIND quickly on the web all  available sound knowledge related to said effective web-searching techniques :-)

<br> <br>
<font size=+3><font color=blue>If you learn how to search, the global knowledge of the human race is at your disposal</font></font>
<br><br> 

Do not forget it 
for a minute. Never in the history of our race have humans had, before, such mighty knowledge chances. 
<br>You may sit in your Webcaf� in Berlin or in 
your university of Timbuctou, you may work in your home in Lissabon or study in a small school of the Far�er islands... 
 you'll de facto be able to 
zap <font color=blue>FOR FREE</font> the 
SAME (and HUGE) amount of resources as -say- a student in Oxford or Cambridge... as far as you are able to 
find and evaluate your targets.  <br>Very recently Google has announced its 'library' project: 
 the libraries involved include those of the universities of Harvard, Oxford, Michigan and Stanford and the New York Public Library.
 <br>
  Harvard alone has some 15 million books, collected over four centuries. 
  Oxford�s Bodleian Library has 5 million books, selected over five centuries. 
  The proposed system will form a new "Alexandria", holding what must be close to the sum of all human knowledge.
<br><br>
Today we'll investigate together various different aspects of "the noble art of searching": inter alia how to search for anything, from 
"frivolous" mp3s, 
games,  pictures or complete newspapers collections, to more serious targets like
software, laws, books or hidden documents... we'll also briefly see how to bypass censorship, how to enter closed databases... 
but in just one hour you'll probably only fathom the existence of the abyss, not its real depth and width.
<br><br> 
Should you find our searching techniques (which seem amazing simple "a posteriori") interesting and worth delving into, be warned: 
behind their apparent simplicity a high mountain of knowledge and lore awaits you, its magnificient peaks  well beyond the clouds. 
<br>I'll just show you, now, where the different paths begin. Should you really take them, you'll have to walk. A lot.

<font size=+2><u>  Examples of "web-multidepth"<br></u></font>  
<br><br>
"<font color=blue>I've heard legends about information that's supposedly "not online", but have never managed to locate any myself.  
    I've concluded that this is merely a 
    rationalization for inadequate search skills. Poor searchers can't find some 
    piece of information and so they conclude it's 'not online</font>"
<br><br>
<i> The depth and quantity of information available on the web, once you peel off the stale and useless commercial crusts, 
is truly staggering. Here 
    just some examples, that I could multiply "ad abundantiam", intended to give you "<font color=blue>a taste</font>" of the 
    deep depths and currents of the web of knowledge...

   <a href="http://www.adforum.com/english/GBR/adfolio/search.asp">A database and a search engine for advertisements</a>, completely free, you may enlarge (and copy) 
   any image, watch  
   any ad-spot. <br>
Advertisements from Brasil to Zimbabwe. Very useful for <a href="antiadve.htm">anti-advertisement debunking activities</a>, 
   for avertisement reversing and for the various "casseurs de pub" and anti-advertisement movements 
   that are -Gott sei dank- now aquiring more and more strength, at least in  the European Union. <br><br> 
   
   <!--
   Of course when you study advertisement debunking you should also take account of the EVOLUTION of advertisement, and here is 
   where sites like <a href="http://scriptorium.lib.duke.edu/adaccess/browse.html">http://scriptorium.lib.duke.edu/adaccess/browse.html</a> (1911-1956) 
   may come handy.  -->

   And what about a place like this?<br> <a href="http://www.britishpathe.com/">http://www.britishpathe.com/</a>: "Welcome 
   to Version 3.2 of the world's first digital news archive.

You can preview items from the entire British "<u><font color=blue>Pathe 
Film Archive</font></u>" which covers news, sport, social history and entertainment from 1896 to 1970"...3500 hours of movies! 
and 12,000,000 (12 MILLIONS) still images for free!
<br><br>
Or what about a place like this?
<br>
<a href="http://anno.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/anno">Anno</a>: Austrian newspapers on 
line. 1807-1935: COMPLETE copies of many Austrian newspapers from Napoleon to Hitler... 
for instance <a href="http://anno.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/anno?apm=0&aid=ibn&datum=18680605&seite=1&zoom=2">Innsbrucker Nachrichten, 
1868, 5 Juni, page 1</a>... you can easily imagine how anybody, say in Tanzania, armed with such a site, can prepare 
university-level assignments 
about European history of the late XIX century "ziemlich gr�ndlich", if he so wishes.   
<br><br> 
  And the other way round? If you'r -say- in Vienna and want access to -say- Tanzanian resources?
  <br>
  Well, no problem! <a href="http://www.virtualibrary.udsm.ac.tz/">UDSM virtual library</a> (The University of Dar es Salaam Virtual Library), 
  for instance, and many other resources that you'll be able to  find easily.    And this is just a tiny example of 
  a world where, I'll repeat it again for the zillionth time, EVERYTHING (that can be digitized) is on the Web. 

  <br><br>
  Let's have a closer look at books, using the Gutenberg and the University of Pensylvania engines.

              These are but  examples. Remember that whole national libreries &  
              complete government archives, are going on 
line *in this very moment* in some god-forgotten 
country in Africa or Asia... a world of knowledge at your finger tips, as I said... 
provided you learn how to search...

 <br><hr width=45%><br>  
<font size=+1>    

   The searching landscape has changed abruptly during the last months of 2004. New, powerful search engines have appeared, all trying to 
    snatch google from its (until now still deserved)  top position.  Yahoo has bought <a href="fast.htm">fast/alltheweb</a>...  
    and promptly degraded it, 
    almost destroying what many 
    considered the 
    best search engine of the web (way better than google thank to its boolean operators).
    <br><br>
     <a href="http://a9.com/-/search/advSearch">A9</a> is amazon's amazing search engine, that will allow any simple bot to 
     fetch COMPLETE books, snippet by snippet, using the context search functions.
     <br>Another New contendent: 
     <a target="_top" href="http://beta.search.msn.com/">MSN new beta "super" search</a>, while still in its infancy, 
     has introduced three sliders that put google to shame... Alas, MSbeta's own algos deliver queryresults that 
     are not as pertinent as google, and its 
      SERPs are -as a consequence- next to useless.  But we should never underestimate the enemy, and we should 
      never underestimate Microsoft.
     <br><br>
     A9 and MSSearch Beta  
     are just two examples.  Of course they now compete  not only with <a href="google.htm">google</a>, but also with <a href="teoma.htm">teoma</a> 
     and <a href="fast.htm">fast (alltheweb)</a>, now powering yahoo.  
     <br>
     There are MANY other <a href="main.htm">main</a> search engines though, and some of these deserve attention, for instance <a href="inktomi.htm">inktomi</a>, 
     maybe the most underestimated big search engine in the world, which has one of the richest search syntaxes, 
     with lots of unique features and a ranking algo which works often quite well.  
     <br><br>
     Also, <a href="main.htm#kartoo">Kartoo</a> is a very interesting "meta-engine" for seekers, because of its useful 
     graphic "semantic connections". Using it  you'll often find
     new angles for your queries.
     <br><br>
    You would be well advised to note that there are also -now- more and more engines with their own CACHE,
     a complete copy of the web they have indexed, copied pages that you can access even if the 
     original ones have disappeared, a fact that turns out to be EXTREMELY important 
    in our quicksand web, where sites disappear at 
     an alarming rate. At the moment, apart google, we have A9, MSNbetasearch, Baidu & Gigablast, all of them with 
     their very useful <font color=blue>caches</font>.
     <br><br>
     Of course there is always -also- good ole Webarchive to take care of all those <a href="berlin2004.htm#disapp">disappeared sites</a>.
     <br>  
     <br>
     So  we have <font color=blue>many</font> main search engines (and you would be wrong in using only google, 
     because they overlap only in part), and yet you 
     should understand that all <a href="main.htm">main</a> search engines  together cover but a small 
     part of the web. 
     <br><br>
     Google, the biggest of them all, covers -allegedly- around 8 billion pages. Altogether, when you count the overlappings, all main search engines
     cover at most <font color=blue>one half of the web</font> (if ever).<br>
     Let's have a more detailed look at google's depth using, for instance the "Rimbaudian" <font color=blue>wovels</font> approach:
     <br> </i>
     <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&as_qdr=all&q=a&btnG=Search">a</a> (like apple) : 7,440,000,000
     <br>       
       <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&as_qdr=all&q=i&btnG=Search">i</a> (like i-tools) : 2,750,000,000
    <br>
    <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&as_qdr=all&q=e&btnG=Search">e</a> (like e-online) : 1,840,000,000
    <br>
  
    <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&as_qdr=all&q=o&btnG=Search">o</a> (like O'Reilly) : 923,000,000 
    <br>
    <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&as_qdr=all&q=u&btnG=Search">u</a> (like whatuseek) : 457,000,000
    <br><br>   
            If you want to get the whole 8 billions ka-bazoo,  you simply query using the english article  
 <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&as_qdr=all&q=the&btnG=Search">the</a> :-)
         <br><br>
         REDUNDANCE SEARCHING
 <br><br>  
    Let's play a little  <a href="epanalep.htm">Epanalepsis</a>, just to show you some "angles":
    <br>
    <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&as_qdr=all&q=the+the&btnG=Search"> the the </a> : 72,800,000    
    <br>
    <i>Yumm, just doubling the article reduces from 8,000,000,000 to 72,800,000 (more pertinent) sites</i> :-)
    <br>
    <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&as_qdr=all&q=the+the+the&btnG=Search"> the the the </a>   : 73,500,000
    <br>
    <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&as_qdr=all&q=the+the+the+the&btnG=Search"> the the the the </a>    : 71,900,000
    <br>
    Usually the redundance trick gets 'stuck' when you try to repeat the searchterm too much. Just repeating 
    a search term twice, however, cuts a lot of noise. 
    
    <br><br>So, to make an example that some of you will enjoy, the moronical one-word search string  
    <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&as_qdr=all&q=ddos&btnG=Search">ddos</a>   gives you 899,000 results, while  
    the slightly less moronical query 
    <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&as_qdr=all&q=ddos+ddos&btnG=Search">ddos ddos</a>   gives you around half 
    that number  (474,000) and these results have also less noise.
    <br>
    Can we do better? Yes of course... let's kill all those useless "com" sites: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&as_qdr=all&q=ddos+ddos+-%22.com%22&btnG=Search">ddos ddos -".com"</a> :
    203,000 results, mucho more cleano. 
    <br><br>
    Some of you would probably think: great, then <font color=blue>this</font> is the way to go... just double the queryterm 
    and eliminate the ".com" sites, how simple and elegant...
    <br>
    Maybe, for a broad search, but for a serious work
     on ddos attacks you may also find relevant signal with a specific SCHOLAR search engine (limiting it to the most 
    recent 
    months): <br>
    <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?num=100&hl=en&lr=&q=ddos+ddos+%22june+%7C+july+%7C+august+%7C+september+%7C+october+2004%22&btnG=Search">ddos ddos "june | july | august | september | october 2004"</a>
     This is a MUCH more useful ddos query<br>   
  However seeking, once more, is NOT (or only in part) made using the <a href="main.htm">main</a> search engines. 
    <br><br>
    In order to understand searching strategies, you have first to understand how the web looks like.   
          <br>
    First of all the web is at the same time <font color=blue>extremely static</font> AND a <font color=blue>quicksand</font>, an oximoron? 
    No, just an apparent contradiction. 
    <br> 
    <br>   
    See: Only less than one half of the pages available today will be available next year. <br>    
    Hence, after
a year, about 50% of the content on the Web <font color=blue><u>will be new</u></font>. The <font color=blue>Quicksand</font>. <br>

    Yet, out of all pages that are still available after one
year (one half of the web), half of them (one quarter of the web), have not changed at all during the year. The  <font color=blue>static</font> aspect
<br>
<br>Those are the "<font color=blue>STICKY</font>" pages.<br>
Henceforth the creation of new pages is a much
more significant source of change on the Web than the
changes in the existing pages. Coz relatively FEW pages are changed: Most Webpages are either taken off the web, 
 or replaced with new ones, or 
added <i>ex novo</i>.
<br>      
Given this low rate of web pages' "survival", historical
archiving, as performed by the Internet Archive, is of
critical importance for enabling long-term access to historical
Web content. In fact a significant fraction of pages accessible today
will be QUITE difficult to access next year.  
<br>
But "<font color=blue>difficult to access</font>"    means only that: difficult to access. In fact those pages will in the mean 
time have been copied
in MANY private mirroring servers.
One of the basic laws of the web is that <br>
EVERYTHING THAT HAS BEEN PUT ON THE WEB ONCE WILL LIVE ON COPYCATTED ELECTRONS FOREVER<br>
How to find it, is another matter :-)
<br><br>
   Some simple rules:<br>
1. always use more than one search engine! "<i>Google alone and you'll never be done!</i>" <br>
2. Always use lowercase queries! "<i>Lowercase just in case</i>" <br>
3. Always use MORE searchterms, <font color=blue>not only one</font> "<i>one-two-three-four, and if possible even more!</i>" (5 words searching);<br>
This is EXTREMELY important. Note that -lacking better ideas- even a simple REPETITION of the same term
 -as we have seen- can give you more accurate results:

<br><br> 
                One of the main reasons why the main search engines  together cover (at best) just something less than 1/2 of the web 
                 is a LINGUISTIC one.  The main search engines are, in fact, "englishocentric" if I may use this term, and 
                 in many cases - which is even worse -  are subject to a heavy "americanocentric bias".  
                 <br><br>
                 The web is truly international, to an extent that even those that did travel a lot tend to underestimate. 
                 Some of the pages you'll find may point to problems, ideals and aims so 'alien' from your point 
                 of view that -even if you knew the language or if they happen to be in english- you 
                 cannot even hope to understand them. On the other hand this multicultural 
                 and truly international cooperation may bring some  fresh air in a 
                 world of cloned Euro-American zombies who drink the same coke with the same bottles, wear the same shirts, 
                 the same shoes (and the same pants), 
                 and sit ritually in the same McDonalds in order to perform their compulsory, collective 
                 and quick "reverse shitting".
         <br><br> 
         But seekers need to understand this Babel if they want to add depth to their queries.<br>
             Therefore they need <a href="dictiona.htm">linguistic aids</a>.
         <br><br>

   There are MANY <a href="dictiona.htm">linguistic aids</a> out there on the web, and many systems that allow you to translate a page, or a snippet of text from 
   say, Spanish, into English or viceversa.
   <br><br>
  As an example of how powerful such services can be in order to understand, for example, a Japanese site, 
  have a look at the following trick:
  <br><br>
 <font color=blue size=+2>RIKAI</font><br>
An incredible translator!<br> 
<a href="http://www.rikai.com/perl/Home.pl">http://www.rikai.com/perl/Home.pl</a>
<br>Try it for instance onto http://www.shirofan.com/ See? It   "massages" WWW pages and
 places "popup translations" from the EDICT database behind the Japanese text!
<br><br>

for instance<br>
http://www.rikai.com/perl/LangMediator.En.pl?mediate_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.shirofan.com%2F

<br>See?<br>
   You can use this tool to "guess" the meaning of many a japanese page or -and especially- japanese search engine options, 
   even if you do not know Japanese :-)<br>
   You can easily understand how, in this way, you can -with the proper tools- explore the wealth of results that the 
   japanese, chinese, korean, you name them, search engines may (and probably will) give you.
    <br><br>
    Let's search for "<font color=blue>spanish search engines</font>"... see?
    <br>
    Let's now search for "<font color=blue>buscadores hispanos</font>"... see?

   Another possible approach is what has been explained in the <a href="eurosearch.htm">Das grosse europ�enne bellissimo search</a> essay, 
   where I underlined how the fact that the European Union allows free access to his huge and truly immense document  
   database (millions of laws and other documents, all of them translated -now after the enlargement- into *20* lanuages) is tantamount 
   -in terms of importance for searchers- to the US-Pentagon 
   having allowed every traveller to use the military GPS services for free.<br><br>
   Here just a couple of examples among million possibilities: you search for, say,  
   <br>
   <a href="http://europa.eu.int/servlet/portail/RenderServlet?search=Query&lg=en&nb_docs=25&domain=&coll=&in_force=NO&title=&party=&year_from=2001&month_from=01&day_from=01&year_to=&month_to=&day_to=&text=spamming&from=01%2F01%2F2001&to=">spamming</a>
   or <a href="http://europa.eu.int/servlet/portail/RenderServlet?search=Query&lg=en&nb_docs=25&domain=&coll=&in_force=NO&title=&party=&year_from=2001&month_from=01&day_from=01&year_to=&month_to=&day_to=&text=%22Information%20Society%22&from=01%2F01%2F2001&to=">information
   society</a>  
    on the europa server and you find a document on <font color=blue>spamming</font> on the "Official Journal C 051 E , 26/02/2004 P. 0178 - 0179", or 
    one on the 
   <font color=blue>information society</font> on the "Official Journal L 321 , 06/12/2003 P. 0041 - 0042".<br>
    <br>You may have a look at them, at once,  in english AND IN ANY OTHER OF THE 20 OFFICIAL LANGUAGES of the Union!<br>
    <br>
    Hence you can search -with your own powerful arrows- using languages that you do not even know!<br>
    <br>for instance use the form below to fetch the spamming document (2004c051) or the information

        How many webs out there? A lot! <br>
        It is always worth THINKING about your target's habitat before starting your long term searching 
        trip. If you are looking for assembly knowledge, for instance, you should know that there are 
        DIFFERENT and MANY groups that deal with that:
        <br>
        1) Virus writers (that of course must know assembly cold)<br>
        2) and their corollary: virus-protection software programmers (maybe the same guys, who knows?&nbsp;:-)<br>
        3) crackers (that break software protection schemes, often enough changing a single byte of a kilometer 
        long 'high language' protection&nbsp;:-)<br>
        4) on-line gamers, those that would sell their aunts to have a character with more lifes  or magic swords 
        when playing on their on-line game servers. By the way: on-line 
        gamers are often also -for the same reason- quite good IP-protocol and server-client experts&nbsp;:-)<br>
        <br>
        Similarly, if you were looking for password breaking and database entering (without authorization,la va sans dire), you would also have 
        to consider different communities:<br>
        1) seekers (as I'll explain below, we need to be able to go everywhere on the web, otherwise we cannot seek effectively&nbsp;:-)<br>
        2) porn-afecionados (that have devised incredible methods to enter their beloved filth-databases)<br>
        3) people that need consulting scholarly (often medical) magazines (that, alas, often enough require  registration 
        and money and/or a university account to be read... something which is rather annoying&nbsp;:-)

<font size=+2><u>  Homepages and Email one-shot providers and 'light' anonymity</u></font>
<br><br>
It's simply amazing how many possibilities you have to create "one-shot" email addresses with 
     huge repositories where you can upload, share and download QUICKLY whatever you fancy. For these very reasons, on these places  you 
     can also, often enough, find some very juicy targets&nbsp;-)<br><br> 
     
             
             Of course, for "survival" reasons, you should use some tricks for your files. Especially in 
             copyright obsessed countries, or if you personally are not politically correct - or 
             obedient - vis-�-vis your local national copyright dictatorship.
             <br>
             A simple trick is what I like to call the "zar" compression method (zip+ace+rar): You zip (and password protect), then ace 
             (and password protect), then rar (and password protect) your file. Or choose 
             any other sequence of the various packers, for instance first zip (then stegano into a -say- wav file), then ace the result (then 
             stegano into a -say- rm file), then, again, rar the result (then stegano again into -say- a (huge) pdf file)... you 
             get the hang of it... You decide the sequences.
             <br><br>(You'll of course automate this process using a simple batch file)<br>
             <br>
             Then, once done, you change the name of your <font color=blue>resulting</font> file 
             to -say- a <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~ritter/tiff/">tiff</a> format (even if it is no tiff file, who cares?&nbsp;:-) 
             and up it goes! Better if split into many (at least two) parts. 
             Noone/nobot will really try to see/reconstruct the picture, they will think, at worse, it is some kind of corrupted file, 
              especially if you call it in your email subject 
             something like "tiff with x rays of my 
             last shoulder fracture": they won't be so easily able to 
             sniff your real data either, unless they have really *a lot of time* and/or are really after you&nbsp;:-).
             <br><br>
             Once your friends download the file, they will go all the steps you have chosen in reverse (with a batch file), and that's it.
             <br><br>
             Phone them the password(s) for some added (light) anonimity.

      <font color=blue>"Light anonymity" must know</font><br>
      Of course when you sign up for these services you should <b><u>NEVER</u></b> give them <font color=blue>your real data</font>. 
      <br>Lie to them a-plenty and shamelessly, 
      like  there were no tomorrow... coz there isn't one&nbsp;:-)<br>But in order to "build" a credible lie, you need some real data.
      And there are <a href="droptableifexists.txt">plenty of personal data</a> around if you use the right <a href="rabbits.htm">webbit</a> 
      <br> A very simple method: 
      just take a book from your library... here for instance, <font color=blue>Bill Rosenblatt, Learning the Korn Shell, O'Reilly,
      103 Morris Street, Suite A, Sebastopol, California 95472</font>. Such data are more than enough 
      to "get signed" anywhere as, for instance, "Rose Billenblatt", 103 Morris Street, Suite B (if there's a "suite A", chances 
      are there'll be a "suite B", duh), Sebastopol, CA 95472, USA. 
      A very credible, solid address.<br> 
      Should you have to answer any further question when signing up for a "free" email address (your occupation, your level of income...)   just choose either the FIRST option of the 
      proposed alternatives ("accountant", "over 10 million bucks per month") or select always the option "other" so that they will add even more 
      crap to their lists&nbsp;:-)<br> Point to remember: <font color=blue>on the web you NEVER give away your true identity</font>. 
      <br><br>
      Do not feel bad while feeding them only lies: the very reason they HAVE such "free" email addresses sites is -of course- to READ 
      everything you write and to have a copy of everything you upload or create. 
      Of course no human being will ever read what you write, but their bots and grepping algos will do it for the owners of the "free" email services
       (or of the "free" search engines), 
       presenting them 
        nice tables built on your private data as a result. 
      
      <br><br>Imagine you yourself are controlling, say, yahoo, and you notice (through your greps) that 2 thousand (or hundredthousand)
       
      bozos are suddendly going <font color=blue>right now</font> to advise their friend to sell tomorrow  all shares of, say, 
      pepsi cola... Youd ig it? Insider trading is NOTHING in comparison with 
      the insider data you can have sniffing emails or search queries on the <a href="main.htm">main</a> search engines... or why did you think you 
      have "free" search engines in the first place? Coz yahoo and google owners are nice people that want to help you 
      finding stuff on the web? Nope. The real reason is obvious:  in order to know what people are searching for, duh.  
      That's the reason you should always strive to give them as few data as you can. It's like the supermarket "fidelity cards": they 
      just want to stuff their databases for next to free in order to know how much you cry/shit/sleep and/or make love. To spend less money and
      gain more money from their customers, not the other way round for sure, despite the lilliputian "discounts" they advertise for the 
      zombies that use fidelity cards. 
 
      <br><br>
      A last point: the list of free email accounts above is of course NOT exhaustive. To fetch MANY more freemail accounts you just build a simple 
      webbit ad hoc:<br> <a href="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=walla+rediff+unitedemailsystems&num=10&hl=en&btnG=Google+Search&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&lr=&as_ft=i&as_filetype=&as_qdr=all&as_nlo=&as_nhi=&as_occt=any&as_dt=i&as_sitesearch=&safe=images">walla rediff unitedemailsystems</a>
      <br><br>
      Of course, for email providers, as for everything else, there are     ad hoc communities and specific 
      <a href="http://www.emailaddresses.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?forumid=8">messageboards</a>, worth perusing...
      <br><br>
      There are also MANY providers that will give you limited accounts (as many as you want, but they'll die after -say- 30 days), 
      for instance <a href="http://4806.runbox.com/">runbox</a>...
      <br>
      Such accounts are IDEAL for quick transfer of files between friends (Runbox: 1 GB email storage  ~ 
100 MB file storage ~
30 MB message size limit, 30 days limit).<br>Accounts that are nuked after a given number of days 
are <font color=blue>even better</font>, in  "twilight" cases&nbsp;:-)  
vis-�-vis accounts that remain for ever, even when you have forgotten having used them&nbsp;:-) <br><br>
Yet please note that, in order to offer 1 gigabyte throw-away email addresses for free, you need to be able to offer a SIGNIFICANT server 
configuration, which is rarer as you may think, and -hence- that most of the "small" 1-giga email repositories are -mostly- just scam 
sites that <font color=blue>do not work</font>, 
so, if you want to be "sure and pampered" stick with the known big working ones: walla, yahoo (& yahoo china) gmx, and rediff.

<font size=+3>  Let's find a book </font> 
  <br><br>Let's begin from the beginning. As most of you I am sure have already realized, we live in a world
   where <font color=blue>crap is king</font> and at the same time good, useful alternatives are hard to find.<br> 
  This is -alas- true for most things, for instance cars, clothes, toys, politicians, games, films, wines, musics  and <u>books</u>. 
  <br>Let's take say -appropriate for this "ccc" audience- "computer books". <br>Anyone among us
  can enter a bookshop and have a look at the computer books on sale. 
  Shelfs over shelfs of "Discover Perl", "Learn C++Net in 
  12 days" and whatsnot:  the absolute crap, hundred of meters of absolute crap books, guaranteed to teach nothing and remain actual, at 
  best, a couple of months.<br><br> 
  Try to find books about <font color=blue>assembly</font>, on the other hand, and you 
 will be in for a surprise: nothing, or next to nothing. That's because assembly knowledge both <font color=blue>lasts forever</font> and  gives 
 you <font color=blue>real power</font>, 
 and noone is really interested in selling you that.<br>
  <br>But there is no reason why you should buy those crap books anyway. In fact they are all on the web... moreover, 
 the copies on the web are probably more "uptodate" than what you would find in the best shop in Berlin. 
  <br>Huge repositories of all O'reilly 
  books in many chinese and korean servers, for instance, complete pdf copies of all those moronical "for dummies" crap everywhere you would 
  care to search.<br>
  <br>I'll now give you a "Moldovian" example, that has the added advantage of demonstrating at the same time the 
  importance of <a href="nomomen.htm">names</a> on the web.
    <br>


<br> Please note that this is legal only for all those among you that are 
students of the university of <a href="http://66.102.11.104/search?q=cache:PDvXzJbRucgJ:www.iipa.com/rbc/2004/2004SPEC301MOLDOVA.pdf+moldova+%22copyright+law%22&hl=en&start=2">Moldova</a>,

Frodo and Sam returned to their beds and lay there in silence resting for a little, while men bestirred themselves and the business of the day began. After a while water was brought to them, and then they were led to a table where food was set for three. Faramir broke his fast with them. He had not slept since the battle on the day before, yet he did not look weary.

When they had finished they stood up. `May no hunger trouble you on the road,' said Faramir. `You have little provision, but some small store of food fit for travellers I have ordered to be stowed in your packs. You will have no lack of water as you walk in Ithilien, but do not drink of any stream that flows from Imlad Morgul, the Valley of Living Death. This also I must tell you. My scouts and watchers have all returned, even some that have crept within sight of the Morannon. They all find a strange thing. The land is empty. Nothing is on the road, and no sound of foot, or horn, or bowstring is anywhere to be heard. A waiting silence broods above the Nameless Land. I do not know what this portends. But the time draws swiftly to some great conclusion. Storm is coming. Hasten while you may! If you are ready, let us go. The Sun will soon rise above the shadow.'

The hobbits' packs were brought to them (a little heavier than they had been), and also two stout staves of polished wood, shod with iron, and with carven heads through which ran plaited leathern thongs.

'I have no fitting gifts to give you at our parting,' said Faramir; `but take these staves. They may be of service to those who walk or climb in the wild. The men of the White Mountains use them; though these have been cut down to your height and newly shod. They are made of the fair tree lebethron, beloved of the woodwrights of Gondor, and a virtue has been set upon them of finding and returning. May that virtue not wholly fail under the Shadow into which you go!'

The hobbits bowed low. `Most gracious host,' said Frodo, 'it was said to me by Elrond Halfelven that I should find friendship upon the way, secret and unlooked for. Certainly I looked for no such friendship as you have shown. To have found it turns evil to great good.'

Now they made ready to depart. Gollum was brought out of some corner or hiding-hole, and he seemed better pleased with himself than he had been, though he kept close to Frodo and avoided the glance of Faramir.

'Your guide must be blindfolded,' said Faramir, 'but you and your servant Samwise I release from this, if you wish.'

Gollum squealed, and squirmed, and clutched at Frodo, when they came to bind his eyes; and Frodo said: 'Blindfold us all three, and cover up my eyes first, and then perhaps he will see that no harm is meant.' This was done, and they were led from the cave of Henneth Ann�n. After they had passed the passages and stairs they felt the cool morning air, fresh and sweet, about them. Still blind they went on for some little time, up and then gently down. At last the voice of Faramir ordered them to be uncovered.

They stood under the boughs of the woods again. No noise of the falls could be heard, for a long southward slope lay now between them and the ravine in which the stream flowed. To the west they could see light through the trees, as if the world came there to a sudden end, at a brink looking out only on to sky.

'Here is the last parting of our ways,' said Faramir. 'If you take my counsel, you will not turn eastward yet. Go straight on, for thus you will have the cover of the woodland for many miles. On your west is an edge where the land falls into the great vales, sometimes suddenly and sheer, sometimes in long hillsides. Keep near to this edge and the skirts of the forest. In the beginning of your journey you may walk under daylight, I think. The land dreams in a false peace, and for a while all evil is withdrawn. Fare you well, while you may!'

So, I imagine you want to know HOW to find mp3 on the web? Say some music by Dylan (I am old, ya know?)

<bR>
Well the answer is of course NOT to use arrows like mp3 or, say, dylan mp3 music, 
which will only sink you into the most awful commercial morasses.<br>
Even the old good arrow <a href="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=%2B%22index+of%22+%2BmP3+%2Bdylan&num=10&hl=en&btnG=Google+Search&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&lr=&as_ft=i&as_filetype=&as_qdr=all&as_nlo=&as_nhi=&as_occt=any&as_dt=i&as_sitesearch=&safe=images">+"index of" 
+mP3 +dylan</a> has been recently broken by the commercial pests, 
and even the -".com" suffix wont help in these cases.<br>
Of course anyone could find "a lot of" music using for instance the "allintitle" parameter with google 
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&as_qdr=all&q=allintitle%3A++%22index+of%2Fmp3%2F%22&btnG=Search">allintitle:  "index of/mp3/"</a>
but we want to find specific mp3, not just a lot of crap, don't we?
<br><bR>
But we have MORE arrows :-)

  Here the good old "andromeda" trick: <a href="http://www.alltheweb.com/search?advanced=1&cat=web&jsact=&_stype=norm&type=all&q=powered+by+Andromeda+version+1.9.2+PHP&_b_query=&l=en&ics=utf-8&cs=utf8&wf%5Bn%5D=3&wf%5B0%5D%5Br%5D=%2B&wf%5B0%5D%5Bq%5D=&wf%5B0%5D%5Bw%5D=&wf%5B1%5D%5Br%5D=%2B&wf%5B1%5D%5Bq%5D=&wf%5B1%5D%5Bw%5D=&wf%5B2%5D%5Br%5D=-&wf%5B2%5D%5Bq%5D=&wf%5B2%5D%5Bw%5D=&dincl=&dexcl=&geo=&doctype=&dfr%5Bd%5D=1&dfr%5Bm%5D=1&dfr%5By%5D=1980&dto%5Bd%5D=26&dto%5Bm%5D=12&dto%5By%5D=2004&hits=10">powered+by+Andromeda+version+1.9.2+PHP</a>

  Here a recent one I found two days ago myself: using the small image of a musical note that 
  appears in most mp3 listings: <IMG SRC="images/bulletr.gif" ALT="red" align="bottom" valign="bottom" WIDTH="13"
HEIGHT="13">&nbsp;
  <!-- http://www.google.com/search?as_q=sound2.gif+%22mp3%2F%22&num=10&hl=en&btnG=Google+Search&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&lr=&as_ft=i&as_filetype=&as_qdr=all&as_nlo=&as_nhi=&as_occt=any&as_dt=i&as_sitesearch=&safe=images -->
  <br><br>
  But if you insist in searching for mp3 another good idea would be to use search engines situated in less 
  "copyright obsessed" countries, like <a href="http://mp3.baidu.com/m?tn=baidump3&ct=134217728&rn=&word=dylan&lm=-1">Baidu</a>...
  <br>
  <br><br>Of course music-aficionados have their own messageboards, where they list the most juicy servers they found (once again this 
  is <font color=blue>combing</font>: finding people that have already found): 
  <br>Example of a "MP3-fanatics" messageboard: <IMG SRC="images/bulletr.gif" ALT="red" align="bottom" valign="bottom" WIDTH="13"
HEIGHT="13">&nbsp; <!-- http://mp3megamart.com/ -->
  <br>Example of a "juicy" server: <IMG SRC="images/bulletr.gif" ALT="red" align="bottom" valign="bottom" WIDTH="13"
HEIGHT="13">&nbsp;<!-- http://batcave.ath.cx/ -->
<br><br>
If you comb the web just a little, you'll quickly find out that 
some people "trade" (for free) mp3s on many "high quality" networks 
<br>
Example: 
<IMG SRC="images/bulletr.gif" ALT="red" align="bottom" valign="bottom" WIDTH="13"
HEIGHT="13">&nbsp;
  <!--http://ubernet.org/index.php -->
<br> 
"high quality" because all mp3s must have very high bitrates (say more than 192).
<br>Like in a torrent system, the amount of material available is huge, but you will get dropped if you do not contribute.

It's very easy once you have the exact name, for instance <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&as_qdr=all&q=TorrentSpy-0.2.4.26-win32.zip&btnG=Search">TorrentSpy-0.2.4.26-win32.zip</a>. Else 
you can simply try   the serial path.<br>

         <br>This is an incredibly OLD serial for Opera for Windows version 5! (Very obsolete) But using it you 
         bypass at once ALL the crap sites that do not give you real serialz :-)

See? The point being, as usual, that you should never throw money away when you need books, music, software or scholarly material.
The web provides everything for free, everywhere. It was MADE for this. It was made in order to share material, not to 
sell or hoard it. Its structure, as you have seen, is such that trying to sell something that has been 
published on the web is tantamount to a  <br>
Chances are you won't need to give money away for your STUDIES any more very soon: some universities have begun to put 
all their courses, for free, on the web. An approach still <i>in fieri</i>, that will probably be more common in a few years time.

Example: <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/index.html">http://ocw.mit.edu/index.html</a>: "<font color=blue>a free and open educational resource for faculty, students, and self-learners around the world</font>".

<font size=+4>SLIDES for
BERLIN</font> (21C3: 29/12/2004)<br>
<br></center>
<br> <font color=blue size=+2>The web is still growing</font><br>Nobody knows how big the web is, but we may make some good guesses watching the growth (or reduction) of some 
small specific portions of the web. You'll find in our <a href="library.htm">library</a>  more material    
about the different methods that have been used 
to measure the width of the web.  
<br><br>
The data below are  extrapolations    
 I have made <font color=blue>since January 2000</font>, using the frequency, visiting 
patterns and referrals data gathered from
    my three main sites (<a href="http://www.searchlores.org">www.searchlores.org</a>  - Oz,
 <a href="http://www.searchlore.org">www.searchlore.org</a> - States,
 <a href="http://www.fravia.net">www.fravia.net</a>  - Europe)<br>
The algo I used is a development of previous  extrapolations, <font color=blue>made since <font color=blue>1995</font></font> on some 
 -now obsolete- old reverse engineering 
sites of mine, 
and has <font color=blue>proved over many years to be rather correct</font>, given or taken a ~ 15% margin of error, so I -personally- trust it.
<br>
<br>
However I am not going to explain nor justify 
my parameter choices here, suffice to say that the data are not just taken off thin air (in fact you'll  easily find out,  
searching the web, that most scholar authors 
and many -mostly self-called- experts 
DO indeed confirm these data).
<br><br> <font color=blue size=+2>The growth of the Web in billions pages</font> (January 2000 - October 2004)<br>
   Coupla things worth noticing in this slide: <br>
    <font color=blue>1</font>) The web grows much more slowly since mid-2003, see also the next "pace of growth" slide.
    <br>
    <font color=blue>2</font>) Every October of the last 5 years there has been 
    a remarkable REDUCTION of the web width. Why this happens, frankly, still beats me.
    <br>
  <font color=blue>3</font>) Google (says they have) expanded its index to 8 billions sites in early october 2004 
  (as an answer to the arrival on the searchscape of the new MSbetasearch, the new Amazon's A9 and 
    the new, alltheweb powered, yahoo) doubling its indexes from the previous 4 million sites total (one wonders where google 
    kept those extra 4 billions  indexed pages before such enlargement, btw&nbsp;:-) 
    <br>This brings the indexed part of the web to <font color=blue>a little less than the half of it</font>: around 11 billions  
    indexed pages against the 
    23,3 billions existing pages (as per October 2004).

<br> <font color=blue size=+2>The PACE of growth is slowing down</font> <br>
Coupla things worth noticing in the next slide: <br>
    <font color=blue>1</font>) The web grows much more slowly since mid-2003.
    <br>
    <font color=blue>2</font>) Note the "october reductions" as negative growth. In fact these reductions often begin already 
    in September. Usually there's a new, positive, 
    growth towards November, that usually lasts until the following autumn fogs). 
    Why there should be such a contraction towards the end of every sommer is awaiting explanation... go search, find out, and I'll gladly publish 
    YOUR results if you do&nbsp;:-)
    <br>
    <font color=blue>3</font>) Data may be skewed as much as 15% (and probably much more for the first bar on April 2000)

       <br>More than twenty years ago - some of you where not yet born - a great professor and mentor 
        of mine, here in Berlin, told me that 
        you may either know <font color=blue>the correct answer to a specific question</font>, which 
        requires a sound knowledge and/or good memory, or you may know <font color=blue>where 
        to find that answer</font>, which is even better, but requires both a sound knowledge and strong evaluation skills.<br><br>
        My hope is that the techniques I tried to explain today  may help you to bypass at least in part something that 
        -before the web- required *years* of study: <font color=blue>how to find</font> that elusive 
         "where to find that answer" and henceforth how to find "a correct answer" to any specific question. 
        
        
        <br><br>
        <i>So, that was it, thanks for listening... any questions?</i>
