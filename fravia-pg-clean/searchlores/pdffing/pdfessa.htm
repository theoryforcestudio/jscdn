  <h1>How to create PDF-Files from any application that allows printing</h1><br>
  <hr width="100%">
  <h2>~ compatible with any OS that allows print-to-file and GhostScript 
~</h2>
  <hr>
  Ever wondered WHY there are so many PDF-Files around?<br>
  Well, my opinion is because they&acute;re highly portable. From Atari 
to Irix,
  back to Mac, OS/2 and Amiga.<br>
  Check the tools for this little PDF-Creator and you&acute;ll 
see....<br>
  <br>
  <p align="left"> This is a little tutorial on how to create and view 
PDF&acute;s
    without any acrobat stuff :)<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p align="center"><u>What you will need:</u></p>
  <p align="left">First, you need programs to interprete postscript 
(*.ps) and
    PDF-Files. Linux users already got it, others have to download it, 
anyway
    it&acute;s ported to multiple OS.<br>
    <br>
    You need Alladin or GNU Ghostscript and i recommend to get GSView 
too if you&acute;re
    too lazy to type into terminals and check syntaxes cause all you 
need is convenience...
    You can obtain both programs at...</p>

    </u>What is GhostScript ?<br>
    <br>
  <p align="left"> Ghostscript is the name of a set of software that 
provides:
  <div align="left">
    <ul>
      <li>an interpreter for the <b>PostScript&#153;</b> language and 
the Adobe
        <b>Portable Document Format</b> (<b>PDF</b> -- sometimes 
confused with
        Acrobat, Adobe's PDF browser and editor product), and
      <li>The Ghostscript library, a set of procedures to implement the 
graphics
        and filtering capabilities that are primitive operations in the 
PostScript
        language and in PDF.
    </ul>
    <p>Alladin and GNU ghostscript run under different licenses, Alladin 
is newer
      than GNU and also covered by the Alladin free public license. No 
trials,
      no popups.<br>
      <br>
    </p>
    <p>What is GSView?<br>
      <br>
      GSview, a popular freely available MS Win and OS/2 screen 
previewer based
      on Ghostscript. It&acute;s also useful for viewing LaTeX documents 
on Win-machines.
      No trials, no popups.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <u>Let&acute;s get it on....<br>
      <br>
      </u> Here&acute;s the lazy way for win-user:</p>
    <p>So you got GhostScript and GSView downloaded and installed, 
right? right!<br>
      Next you&acute;ll need your winOS-CD to install a printer. Regard 
that you
      choose a PostScript-Printer, means any printer with PS or 
PostScript in
      the name. (doh)<br>
      As device, choose in the printersetup &quot;FILE: Creates a 
file&quot;.<br>
      <br>
      Now everytime you print over that 
&quot;virtualreality-printer&quot;, a
      file will be created called *.PRN. This file can now be viewed 
with GSView.<br>
      Check the options/printer-tab of GSView. Here you choose as device 
&quot;pdfwrite&quot;
      and check the box &quot;Print to File&quot;.<br>
      Now you got your own selbstgebackenen PDF-File.</p>
    <p>Don&acute;t forget to set in options the formats/colours to a 
higher bitrate
      as default, or you&acute;ll get greyscale pictures.<br>
      <br>
      It&acute;s possible to have a reproduction that differs from whats 
printed
      if you selected different drivers for printer and print to file. 
just experiment
      a bit!<br>
      Another problem is that links dont work in those PDFs you create 
this way,
      but hey, GSView is a nice GPL-Tool. What did you expect, 
acrobats?</p>
