<font size=+1 color="#0000FF">Ahhh. What a bliss</font>
<br>
Ahhh. What a bliss. What a speed. What a power!</br> 
Finally a <a href="http://www.gnu.org/home.html">GNU</a>/Linux distro  
that can be recommended without tongue-in-cheek: Ubuntu, 
a powerful, yet simple to install, debian-based OS.
<br><font color="blue">EVERYBODY</font> can now say bye bye windows: 
no more need for the hundred crap programs running in the background,  
those horrible "norton" cans of worms, 
the many buggy antivirii, all the broken firewalls that still slurp rootkits and all kind of  
 malware that infests windows boxes, while allowing users to be graciously bombarderd 
by tons of useless commercial crap.<br>
Ubuntu is the best of two worlds:  
 it suits both the experienced GNU/Linux 
user 
that wants a powerful and reliable desktop system, 
usable without constant fiddling <u>AND AT THE SAME TIME</u> its a godsend for 
the millions of new 
users that are prepared to learn new stuff when they finally decide to migrate from Windows (or from OSX).
<br><br>
A lot of new users that come to GNU/Linux from Windows these days 
want an OS that will run all their favorite applications,  is easy 
to use and basically ready to go out of the box. 
Ubuntu, being all of this, managed for the first time to make GNU/Linux more popular for the masses, 
no minor feat.
 <br>Since Ubuntu is <i>de facto</i> just a polished Debian, 
 it hides sheer untamed cosmic power under the GUI hood.<br>
After a while many Ubuntu users will feel 'adventurous'  and will
 start looking for a less graphic and more CLI oriented experience.<br> 
In fact, as experienced 
GNU/Linux users well know, point and click "is the caveman way of doing things", therefore 
such developments are a win-win situation for everyone.


<br><br><font size=+1 color="#0000FF">Windows, the searchers' horror</font>
<br>Since seekers do visit all kind 
of malbehaving places in the deep deep web (<i><u>it is after all the searchers' pleasure, job and task</u></i>), 
the need -in windows- to clean everything twice a day with adaware, spybot, hijack... 
slowly  affects -negatively- their moods.<br>
Granted, many searchers  turned to 
GNU/Linux already <a href="change_windows.htm">long ago</a>: "the power and the smoothness", 
"the absolute control" or more simply "the joy of knowing what's really going on under the hood".<br>
Least but not last: <font color="#0000FF">no reason, never, to pay for anything</font>, as the whole 
web <u>was meant 
to be</u>... as the web <u>still is</u>... and as the web <u>should be and remain</u> 
for ever.
<bR><br><font size=+1 color="#0000FF">And power, immense sheer power</fonT><br><b>THE</b> characteristic of GNU/Linux 
systems is their power. 
If you, for instance, want to wardrive seriously try <a href="http://www.kismetwireless.net/">kismet</a>:  
you'll never go back to a toy operating system like 
windows nor use half-sniffers like Netstumbler&nbsp;:-)<br>You'r a seeker, arent'you? So as soon as you 
board Ubuntu, play with 
the most powerful <a href="tools.htm#gnu">Network tools</a>... or even just try the simplest ones: 
first run -say- <a href="http://deluge-torrent.org/">Deluge</a> or 
<a href="http://www.transmissionbt.com/">Transmission</a> (or any other net-intensive application) 
and then type in a terminal  <pre><font color=blue>lsof</font></prE> or 
<pre><font color=blue>netstat -l</font></prE>...: <i>vous me 
direz ce que vous en pensez</i>.<br><br>


<font size=+1 color="#0000FF">Avoid the appallingly restrictive(<a href="linux.htm#restrictions">*</a>) Vista frills</font>
<br>Else you'll be stuck in a expensive, mediocre and proprietary OS that will sniff all your 
personal data, mostly in order to make money out of it.
<br>Let me state the following as clearly as I can: 
readers should  ditch  the 
windows operating system before it bites their underpants off
BECAUSE of the current spyware/rootkit/spamming exploits   (why 
do you think there's so much email spam around the world? 
Because a billion zombies are using windows) and also BECAUSE  of the  advent of 
the expensive and intrusive malware called <u>Vista</u>.
<br><br>I know, I know: Linux is free, blah blah,  all its software is free, blah blah, 
and it's more stable and quicker and ethical than 
windows, blah blah... yet for the moment most readers are still 
using Windows.<br>But <u>if  you want to change</u> the moment has cometh.<br><br>
My approach will be different from the usual approaches of many linuxian converters and zealots:<br> You 
should leave windows and go over to a sound GNU/Linux distro 
(for instance Ubuntu) NOT just because it 
represents a completely free operating system, NOT just because of its (relative) freedom from viruses, rootkits  
or worms dangers... you should 
go over to GNU/Linux <u><b><font color="blue">for the sheer searching power of it</font></b></u>. 
<br>Ubuntu has made this "crossing" extremely easy (for the first time in 
the history of mankind), hence its crucial importance 
for all searchers that still use windows.<br><br>Therefore you shouldn't go over to GNU/Linux 
because of 
"the ethical point", 
however important: 
for all I care you can even keep a working copy of windows XP on your box and dual boot as long as you 
fancy... It's a evolutionary snowball. Once you'll have tasted the power and speed and 
-how should I call it- "obedience" of a GNU/Linux box  
you will use windows less and less anyway.<br><br>
In fact I reckon you'll soon even 
rediscover the power of a non GUI  
environment STARTING from a state of the art 
graphical environment... a only apparent contradiction&nbsp;:-)
<br><br>
<font size=+1 color="#0000FF">If until now you only used windows you'll have to work</font>: 
GNU/Linux is NOT windows. 
Better to repeat it: <u><b>GNU/Linux is NOT windows</b></u>.
<br>Ok, ok, relatively little work, but some 
work will be required nevertheless.<br>
First you'll have to cross your fingers and hope that the proprietary drivers of your 
wifi cards, USB applications, 
you name it, will be 
automagically recognized by Ubuntu (they will... most of the time... but not always). 
<br>Then you  will probably have to 
fix your wacky soundcard, your dubious fonts, your funky screen resolutions.<br>Then 
you'll have to finetune and 
fix your <a href="http://www.winehq.org/">wine</a> (for 
those windows applications or games you really think you badly need)<br> 
Then you'll want to speed up your booting, and then you'll want to finetune your 
kernel...<br>So, some work indeed, mostly due to the fact that hidden and secret proprietary 
drivers had to be reversed and reengineered by brave developers, audacious reversers, courageous
 hackers and fearless
crakers in order to 
make them work -for free- inside GNU/Linux... with all the obvious glitches and limitations that this implies.
<br><br>However, after a relatively short while 
you will happily leave behind you Windows once for all. Ahhh. What a bliss!
<br><br>
Note that this kind of thinkering with your own operating system is an important, instructive and useful 
activity <i>per se</i>. Incidentally, it is also great fun. 
<bR>This process of finding out what's exactly wrong and <u>how you can actually indeed 
fix it by yourself</u>, is probably 
one of the nicest things that GNU/Linux can and will teach you.<br>
Again: magic power. The satisfaction of finding out 
by yourself how to modify your box in order to have your PC actually obeying *you* 
(and not some idiot in -say- Redmond) is a great feeling: something you  
will enjoy <u>quite a lot</u>.

<br><br>

<font size=+1 color="#0000FF">Ubuntu is just a compromise</fonT><br> 
From an ethical point of viex  
<a href="http://www.fsf.org/licensing/essays/free-sw.html">really free software</a> and a 
really <font color=blue>completely free</fonT> OS, 
as my <a href="photos.htm">friend</a> Richard Stallman never ceased to assert,  
 is a matter of the users' COMPLETE & UNRESTRICTED freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, 
 change and improve ALL the software on their boxes (We even have  
 a fantasized <a href="misterstallman.htm">song</a> about this).<br><br>
 Ubuntu is full of ugly compromises with proprietary software. If you want more "purity", 
 you'll go elsewhere after a while, for instance towards  
 <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/?ReleaseProposals">real Debian</a> or 
 <a href="http://www.gnewsense.org/">gNewSense</a>. Why not? 
 There's a lot to learn on those "purists" paths. Maybe even more than on 
 more "tainted" paths. You'll judge by yourself.
 <br><br>Yet the
idea behind this section of searchlores -again- 
is not to "<u>fight infidels for purity</u>": the idea is to help anybody and 
his grand-mama,  and especially searchers, 
to swap <u><b>almost on the fly</b></u> a  slow, cumbersome, virus infested, expensive and prone 
to errors windozian box 
into a quick, stable, free and above all <u><b>powerful</b></u> "überlinux" box.<br><table><tr><td>
&nbsp;<IMG SRC="images/distroshare130208_2.gif" ALT="red" align="bottom" valign="bottom" WIDTH="460" HEIGHT="362"></td>
<td>&nbsp;</td><td>
The wildly popular and now most used (<font color=blue>see image on the left</font>)  
  <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a> distro seems to have 
 overcome the awkward installation problems of past distros.<br>It's popularity is imo 
well deserved: I 
have wasted many months of my life compiling and re-compiling kernels and chasing dependencies 
for Slackware and Debian. 
<br>You see: <u>the nice thing</u>, in a free operating 
system, is that anyone can make his own version and use it with half 
a dozen like-minded pals. <u>The terrible thing</u>, alas, 
is that 
this is -maybe- great fun for kernel compilers... but  made anyone used to  the "simplicity" 
of windows to immediately 
forget any alternative to "his" operating system.<br>
Admittedly, 
this happened only 
because windows users don't understand nothing (<i>every operating system has the idiots it deserves</i>...  
 note that many idiots lurk in the 
GNU/Linux world as well),  
nevertheless,  newbies did (and do) 
blame GNU/Linux  for the shortcomings due to the windows "proprietary" drivers dished by
 ignorant 
hardware producers.

<br>
Alas! Whenever encountering rough water, users immediately coward back  
to the 'encompassing' embrace of their malwares-friendly, buggy, overbloated, obsolete, 
data-sniffing and expensive windows operating system. And they are lost (in both senses of the term).<br>
<br>As a consequence of its attempt "to avoid rough waters", 
Ubuntu is a sort of "compromise" between on one side real <u>free untaunted 
software</u> (à la GNU -<a href="http://www.gnewsense.org/">gNewSense</a> for instance)   
and on the other side real <u>rock 
hard concrete & immediate</u> usability.<br>Fact is that with Ubuntu -no minor deed- even your aunt   
will boot up quickly a very stable OS and be happy with it... 
even without  noticing that she is sitting on a space rocket Ferrari.
</td></tr></table><br>
<font size=+1 color="#0000FF">So let's do it. Let's try Ubuntu. How?</font> 
<br>Anyone can try -and even <a href="http://uck.sourceforge.net/">customize</a>- an "ubuntu live" version, 
<font color="blue">before</font> installing the OS for real.<bR> 
A better start imo would be a quick and 
simple <font color=blue>dual installation  Ubuntu + XP (or, ugh, vista)</FONT>, 
given that windows is  (yet)  still useful for 
pixel intensive games... at least until you'll learn how to use properly
<a href="http://appdb.winehq.org/appbrowse.php?catId=2">Wine</a>, 
and/or VMware.<br><br>
The install program of the Ubuntu distro will automatically resize your windows partition and install grub 
(the dual loader). The recent "Heron" has also a special install mode that will use 
your windows partition to install (losing some speed). <font color=blue>Always take care and
defragment well your disk(s) first</font>.<br>Also, before installing, save your valuable data just in case: 
playing with new OSses is <u>always</u> 
a 
risky game, as XP users '<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&rls=en&hs=40K&q=%22upgrading+to+vista%22+%28problems+OR+annoyances%29&btnG=Search">upgrading</a>' to Vista 
will discover to their expenses&nbsp;:-)
<br><br>
Once tried Ubuntu, you'll  use windows less and less. After a relatively short while, 
  you'll just use your new Operating System, and pheraphs, later, even ditch the 
  GUI environment and switch to the CLI (or to another distro) 
in order to learn more and to obtain the power and "raw speed" 
any finetuned distro (gentoo, slackware or debian) will give you... when you seek, 
when you use your box for your everyday activities, when you fight for 
knowledge on the web.<br><br>
This said, Ubuntu should not be underestimated at all: it's no "kid distribution", just debian, 
 a mighty powerhouse! 
<br>And Debian is a splendid choice. 
Once finetuned, ubuntu (or pure Debian) systems are as powerful as any perfectly 
working gentoo system (admittedly: a rare sight&nbsp;:-) 
and only slightly less 
powerful than any hardened and finetuned slackware box.<br><Br>Whatever. Enough propaganda.<br><br> 
Ubuntu seems to be the better choice for most seekers: being Debian it has -<U>by far</U>- 
 much more power under the hood than you could  ever fathom while still offering an 
extremely simple  approach/introduction/entrance to the GNU/linux OS for 
the many just arriving -a little zombified- from the windows sad & slow & boring world AND/OR for all those
that 
actually have better things to do that 
spending afternoons chasing and compiling dependencies.

those that care about frills)</center></td></tr></table></center>
<br>An useful advice for readers coming from the windows world is to check first the 
<a href="bangla.htm">opening windows</a> section of this site. Realizing that you can have 
<u>everything</u> (i.e. <u>any</u> software) for free and legally is a 
first pre-condition in order to understand the immense 
power and potential of GNU/Linux. So the best 'formation' for newcomers is 
imho along the following path:<br><br><center>
<table border="1"><tr><td bgcolor="#d3ba77"><center>windows &#8658; "freesource" windows &#8658; 
GUI-centered GNU/Linux &#8658; CLI GNU/Linux (sheer power)</center></td></tr></table></center>
<br>
Amazingly, one of the most 'moving' points that Ubuntu and other recent GNU/Linux 
distributions have had, capable of getting windows longtime-conditioned users to swap over, are 
linux recent <u>superior graphic</u> capabilities. Amazingly for me, at least, because I have always 
considered graphic effects an almost useless frill.<br>Fact is that nowadays, even if it 
might sound odd for believers in paid advertisements,  <font color=blue>the graphic 
effects offered by Vista or by MACs are 
terribly obsolete if compared with what you can have on a GNU/Linux box</font> (if you don't believe me, 
try the 
<a href="http://www.sabayonlinux.org/">Sabayon</a> gentoo distro&nbsp;:-)
<br>
<br>In fact many watchers still underestimate the fact that 
GNU/Linux CAN offer better frills than Macs and Vistas, believe it or not. 
I personally wouldn't switch my rock-solid Debian/Ubuntu 
setting  
for the remarkable <a href="http://www.sabayonlinux.org/">sabayon</a> gentoo übermonster, 
but younger ones seem to like 
it A LOT (game developers take note&nbsp;:-) and sure fact 
is that 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiz">Compiz</a> and 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiz_Fusion">Compiz/Fusion</a> can 
 (and do) give Mac-fanatics and Vista-zombies a good run uphill for their (wasted) money&nbsp;:-)

<br></center>
The power of Ubuntu is due to the stability, simplicity and 
also to the usefulness of its <a href="http://www.ubuntuforums.org/">messageboards</a> (that seems 
to me better 
than the -also quite useful- <a href="http://forums.debian.net/index.php">Debian</a>, 
<a href="http://forums.gentoo.org/">Gentoo</a> and
<a href="http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/forumdisplay.php?forumid=14">slackware</a> 
 messageboards).
<br><br>
While users coming from a windows environment are the "natural target" 
of all recent GNU/Linux distributions, 
 they still better understand a couple of points.<br>
<ul><li>First of all the source code of many drivers and codecs they are  acquinted with  
inside windows has NOT, never, been released 
in the open domain. <br>Purposedly, <b><u>because commercial developers are bastards idiots</u></b> 
(there is no  
better explanation for this abominable matter of fact). 
Hence such proprietary software must be reversed, 
and usually this takes some time (and some powerful know-how by the mighty 
crackers).<br>
As a consequence, there is a (mostly small)  
delay between the last gee-wizz-bang hardware coming out 'on the market' 
and the reversing and 
porting -for free- of such  proprietary drivers to GNU/Linux. 
<br>This is due to the fact that the commercial idiots don't realize how much 
more hardware they would sell if they had a "Linux/compatible" logo on their hardware. 
In due time they will (in due time we'll probably have 
<font color="blue">free hardware</font> as well&nbsp;:-)</li>
</br>
<lI>GNU/Linux <u><b>IS NOT</b></u> windows, as stated above. 
This 's true under many aspects. The most 
obvious is that 
while with Ubuntu you can have a "total windowesque GUI experience"... 
soon or later (and I hope for you soon) you'll realize that using
 the terminal (ALT+F2 "xterm" or "gnome-terminal") is MUCH more quicker, 
 effective <u>and powerful</u> than clicking here and there and everywhere  
  until head and hands get dizzy.<bR>
 "Windows conditioned users" never understand this at the 
beginning. They wrongly believe  that clicking around is more 'modern & effective'...  
in due time they understand.</li>
</br><li>Yes: any windows applications (Photoshop, Oblivion, Poser, Quake 4, all your 
raw format photo manipulation software...) <u><b>can</b></u> run in Ubuntu. 
There is some work involved of course, and  
it finally depends from your "finetuning capacities". 
<br>You need to try (and finetune) VMware or  Wine (a fantastic "non emulator", 
recently getting better and better).
<bR>It might take some 
time, it might require some kernel finetuning as well, and some trial and error attempts, until <b>ALL</b> your 
applications will run fine... but the satisfaction (and the sheer speed and power) of your Ferrari 
box humming along nicely 
under YOUR power will be a great feeling (the whole migration attempt  will be quite 
an experience WHATEVER operating system you will decide to use at the end of the day&nbsp;:-)</li></br>



<li>USE the <a href="http://www.ubuntuforums.org/">Ubuntu messageboards</a> (forum). These 
are <b>quite</b> useful and very user-friendly places,   offering the added advantage that they list RECENT 
solutions (when searching with <a href="main.htm">main search engines</a> à la google) compared with the 
more general and at times obsolete 
info you would find elsewhere  on the web.</br>
This means, incidentally, 
that even a trivial generic "GNU/Linux-kind of" query will always fetch you interesting and fairly 
*<u>updated</u>*  
results if you prefix it 
with the term 
"<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&rls=en&num=100&hs=NI6&q=%2Bubuntu+%22nvidia+problems%22&btnG=Search">+ubuntu</a>".
</li></br>
<li>A threefold advice for those that will migrate? Learn and use the many powerful commands, 
don't rely only on the GUI and 
<a href="books.htm">find and read some good books and manuals</a> about Ubuntu, Debian and 
more generally GNU/Linux.
</li></ul>

<br>Again, the following list is full of crap: the established "Academia" does not know shit from shinola. 
<br><bR>Elementary <a href="evaluate.htm">evaluation</a> elements: as a simple rule of thumb (with 
huge <i>caveats</i>, duh) 'No starch press' is 'usually' useful, QUE is 'usually'  crappy, O'Reilly is often 
usable; 'Apress' would publish your 
Aunt Carolina's books (...on the other hand  Aunt Carolina might sometime write 
down something worth reading); Wiley is completely unpredictable regarding quality and 
Prentice seems to be -mostlys- quite usable. 
<br>Anyway now that you know that these books seem to have been released in the public domain, 
just <a href="reversing_our_searching_habits.htm#quarry">go out and find and read them</a>. 
Give feedback: your own comments and observations regarding the quality of these books 
would be welcome and useful for all readers.

There's no need to buy (or just search for&nbsp;:-) "proprietary" linux books. Some of the best manuals are 
available for free. Just to make a few examples:<ul><li>
<a href="http://www.cobbaut.be/lt/">Linux Fun: All the Linux basics</a>, this book by Paul Cobbaut, while being a tag 
redhat oriented and <i>de facto</i> "unfinished", is for sure one of the best books you can find and read about 
GNU/Linux. Just download and learn.<br><br>
</li><li>
<a href="http://dsl.org/cookbook/cookbook_toc.html">The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use</a> 
by Michael Stutz. The second edition of this book has been edited by "No Starch Press" in 2002, and is also easily 
available on the web. However, Michael Stutz did put his first (2001) edition on line, and it is for sure 
one of the most useful books you can find.<br><br>

It's amazing how, since Ubuntu hit the scene, the Linux Desktop 
has just dramatically improved. Before Ubuntu, things were meandering along without much focus, it seems, 
with the best 'out of the box' experience being Knoppix... which unfortunately was too complicated for the average 
user to install, being focused -as it was and is- as a Live CD.
<br>
It seems now  that every six months (Ubuntu updating) -and without even taking account of other recent 'polished' distros like 
Sabayon, Mint, Mepis and so on- brings to the linux desktopscene as many, or more, improvements as 
Vista has to XP.</i><br>(~<font size="0" color="#4D4D4D">rolfwind</fonT>)

On a standard GNU/Linux installation you have by default six virtual console or TTY sessions 
running on the VGA console. Six consoles (ttys) that you can access respectively through<br>
CTRL+ALT+F1, CTRL+ALT+F2, CTRL+ALT+F3, 
CTRL+ALT+F4, CTRL+ALT+F5, CTRL+ALT+F6. 
<br>Note that CTRL+ALT+F7 will bring you "back" to your X graphical environment, because the X terminal GUI 
console creates its own virtual console using the first available TTY after the six. 
This makes the GUI run as number 7. 
<br>
Note also that CTRL+ALT+F8 will show you any eventual error message in text mode, while CTRL+ALT+F1 will 
show you the "booting" console (there's a lot to learn about runlevels and <a href="linux.htm#startup">startup</a> 
sequence, btw).<br>
The commands <font color=blue>who</font> and <font color=blue>w</font> will show you who's using which console.
<br><br>As ~S~ Kane points out: 
"<i>disable the unused ttys full stop, better yet run only one and use 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/">screen</a>, 
as screen on one tty is a lot more memory efficient than 6 ttys put together, plus it has other uses</i>". 
<br>
Also, a little app named <a href="http://ww.linuxpowertop.org/powertop.php">powertop</a> 
can help diagnose what is eating power, 
namely the wakeup from idles of normally redundant background crud, it 
also offers some random tips on how to get the power down with kernel 
functions by adding to rc.local or whatever your distro uses (works the best under kernels more recent than

<br><center><font size=+2>It takes a little bit of learning with CLI apps, but once learned, they tend to be<br><u>a lot faster</u> than 
equivalent GUI apps: njnia faster.</font></center>
<br>


Learning how to 
use effectively these consoles requires some experimentation. One of the best reasons 
to use console applications (CLI), instead of graphical interface applications (GUI), 
is in order to spare your laptop's battery consumption.<br> 
If you learn for instance how to use a non graphical, yet very powerful browser like <a href="http://elinks.or.cz/">elinks</a>  
in one console  you'll appreciate the MANY ADDED 
HOURS of undisturbed browsing 
(and downloading) because of the lower battery consumption (especially if you have also stopped/exited the X GUI on CTRL+ALT+F7).<br>
This kind of <font color=blue>non graphical approach</font> is something that has nowadays become almost completely 
"counterintuitive" in the more and more heavily 
frilly "windozian" graphical environment, that has invaded the GNU/Linux world as well (compiz, beryl...).<br>  
Yet such a non graphical approach is <u>hence, therefore and at the same time</u>, a very powerful and 
almost forgotten <u>weapon</u> you might want 
to pick and add to your own über-seeker armory. Probieren geht über studieren, try it and enjoy.
<br>
Note that there are many powerful little programs you can use even <u>inside the GUI environment</u> (also inside your 
standard CTRL+ALT+F7 graphical terminal) in order  
to spare your batteries, for instance using a simple, yet powerful image viewer like <a href="http://linuxbrit.co.uk/feh/">feh</a>, or 
simple, yet 
powerful, pdf viewers like <a href="http://wwwthep.physik.uni-mainz.de/~plass/gv/">gv</a>, or "light" music and video players like
 <a href="http://spuriousinterrupt.org/projects/xfmedia">xfmedia</a>, and so on. The price? Each of tese programs has different 
 command you need to learn. The gain? Battery life.
<br><br>
<br><center><font size=+2>The secret power of a "non GUI" environment</font></center>
<br>
But the real bliss, the real secret power, is... <ul><li>learning how to browse effectively without a GUI
(see <a href="http://elinks.or.cz/">elinks</a> above)</li> 
<li>download, downtorrent (<a href="http://packages.ubuntu.com/dapper/net/rtorrent">rtorrent</a>), 
<font color=blue>bmon</font>, <font color=blue>wget</font> the hell out of it,</li> 
<li> hear music (for instance through 
<a href="http://moc.daper.net/">moc</a> "music on console", 
that you'll call with "mocp"... best audio player ever coded.)</li> 
<li> 
write ("nano", already installed)</li> 
<li> work, calculate (best calculator is <font color=blue>python</font> itself of course), check your emails (<font color=blue>sudo apt-get install alpine</font>) but you 
can simply use the powerful elinks browser for your gmail: google has a perfectly working "non javascript" interface</li> 
 <li>
a most amazing possibility is that you can even see/check your images collections (through a VGA/SVGA display) <u>without</u> a X server and from a tty, using
the amazing <font color=blue>zgv</font> (<font color=blue>sudo apt-get install zgv</font>) from a tty terminal</li>
<li> search, check your internet speed (<font color=blue>bmon</font>)</li>
<li>read any kind of file! For instance <u>doc</u> files (through antiword) and <u>open office</u> files (through odt2txt) and 
even read your pdf files, very simple with <font color=blue>pdftotext</font> 
(usage: <font color=blue>pdftotext pdf_target_file - | less</font>), 
or, with a more complex approach, using <font color=blue>fbi</font> + <font color=blue>fbgs</font>.<br>
Finally you can even read those pesky <u>chm</u> files without any GUI running, using <font color=blue>archmage</font> in order to transform them 
in a html set that you'll open and browse with elinks.</li>
 <li>even play old games without a GUI:  
(<font color=blue>sudo apt-get install nethack-console</font>)</li>
</ul>
...inside a completely non-GUI 
tty, especially useful when you need to cross a big ocean working along, or when you need 
to wardrive, "wardownload" and "warwork" as long as possible with just your depleted 
laptop's batteries -and your wit- to count on.

My <a href="photos.htm#dange">friends</a> Mammon_,   
The Grugq, ReZiDeNt, and
a_p (with the help and contribution of some other good souls) are taking care of the relatively difficoult and for sure  
unsufficiently applauded important task of GNU/Linux reversing... that's slow, coz they have 
other things to do and they work on the <font size="+1" color="#0000FF">Bastard</font> only when they have 
1) <a href="http://bastard.sourceforge.net/news.html">time</a> and 2) leisure and 3) lust...<br>

<br><br>
<br><font size=+2>Note 1</font> (VISTA's RESTRICTION TILT BITS)<br>
<br>
<font size=+1>
For instance Vista's "content protection" requires that all devices 
(hardware and software drivers) set so-called "tilt bits" 
if they detect anything "unusual". 
<br>
For example  if you have an unusual voltage fluctuation, maybe some jitters on bus signals, 
an unexpected return code from a function call, 
a device register that doesn't contain the value that "should" have been there, 
if the hash of an output status message does not match the message, 
or anything similar, a tilt bit gets set. 
If any tilt bit gets set, then Vista will initiate a full reset of 
the graphics subsystem, so everything will restart, including re-authentication.
<br>
This means that <font size="2" color="#0000FF">all Vista boxes are vulnerable to a forced reboot</font> by any process, 
any virus, any worm, any voltage fluctuation.
<br>
With the introduction of tilt bits, any designed-in resilience is gone. 
Every little (normally unnoticeable) glitch suddenly gets his moment of glory because it could be 
a sign of a hack attack.<bR></br>The effect that this will have on system 
reliability should require no further explanation&nbsp;:-)
<bR><br>
In fact I guess (and maybe hope) that in a few years it will be relatively easy 
to send some stuff down the pipe  that will make all the tilt bits bork at once allover the planet&nbsp;:-)</br>


</font>
<a name="startup"></a>
<br><br>
<br><font size=+2>Note 2</font> (startup and shutdown)<br>
If you have a older GNU/Linux system, have a look 
at <u>inittab</u>, inside the <u>/etc</u> folder: <font color=blue>cat /etc/inittab</font> for 
a complete list. Recent 
versions of Ubuntu, however, do not use init anymore to manage their 
services during startup or shutdown of the system. Instead they use "<font color="blue">upstart</font>" 
as replacement 
for the traditional <font color="blue">sysvinit</font> utility.
<br>
All the things that were in the <font color="blue">/etc/inittab</font> have been 
ported to upstart's <font color="blue">/etc/event.d/</font>.
<br>
If you have a look at rc-default inside that directory, you'll see the default runlevel set at two. You 
can change it by editing <font color="blue">/etc/event.d/rc-default</font>.
<br>


 Anyway,  if you want to start without a GUI, in order  
to stop GDM from loading in runlevel 2 (Ubuntu default runlevel) you can 
rename 
<font color="blue">/etc/rc2.d/S30gdm</font> to 
<font color="blue">/etc/rc2.d/K</font><font color="red">70</font><font color="blue">gdm</font> 
(<font color="red">70</font>=100-30).
For instance with the command
<prE>sudo mv /etc/rc2.d/S30gdm /etc/rc2.d/K70gdm</pre>
<br>
The S tells Ubuntu to start the process, and the K tells Ubuntu to kill it. 
The numbers are the order in which it should be started and (100-started=)stopped, 
and may be different on your box. Too complicate? Install and use 
<a href="http://www.marzocca.net/linux/bum.html">BUM</a> (boot up manager), a very useful tool to 
understand and finetune your boot up (and shut down) sequence.
