   The introductory "Oh yeah!" and the  notes with which they started all 
   their famous recordings, the nice vocals, the  bass 
   lines...  
   trademarks of a group whose style was unique 
    and "oh! so smooth".<br>
 Deek "Ivory" Watson from Mounds, Illinois, joned in 1934 Orville "Hoppy" Jones ("the grand old man": the conciliatory father figure 
  of the Ink Spots), Charlie Fuqua (Charlie played the 
 simple guitar introduction to most of the Ink Spots' biggest hits and also some excellent guitar solos 
 on the group's earlier recordings, until he was "covered" by Bill Kenny's tenor performances) and Jerry Daniels to form the "Ink spots" quartet.
 They exploited all kinds of rhythmic vocalisms - straight solos, concerted, scat, and instrumental 
 imitations. They even throw 
 in a bit of dancing to conclude their act, and the leading guitarist 
 simultaneously played and juggled with his guitar.<br><br><ul><li>
   <a href="music/The_Ink_Spots_Your&#32;Feet's_Too_Big.mp3">music/The_Ink_Spots_Your Feet's_Too_Big.mp3</a> (Decca 12/05/1936, hence more than 60 years: 
   NOT COPYRIGHTED)<br>Jerry Daniels had already left and 
   Bill Kenny's high tenor can be heard for the first time in this song as the Ink spots pass the lead vocal around amongst themselves<br>
    </li><li><a href="music/The_Ink_Spots_Let's_Call_The_Whole_Thing_Off.mp3">music/The_Ink_Spots_Let's_Call_The_Whole_Thing_Off.mp3</a> (Decca 9/04/1937, 
    hence more than 60 years: 
   NOT COPYRIGHTED)<br>From Gershwin, here again you can easily recognize  Bill Kenny's high tenor voice<br>

   <br><br>
   If you want to "see" them singing, the only two snippets I found on the web are 
   NOT very interesting: <a href="http://www.group-harmony.com/VIDEO/v_inks.rm">"I've Got A Bone To Pick With You"</a>, from the movie 
    "The Great American Broadcast" (1941) and <a href="http://www.group-harmony.com/VIDEO/v_worry.rm">"Do I Worry?"</a>, from the movie 
    "Pardon My Sarong" (1942). Use "<a href="bangla.htm#irfan">Media player classic</a>" (of course) to see/hear thes etwo snippets.
   <br><br>
   If you want a list of their CDs (of course not "to buy" them, 
   just to find them on the web (or to borrow them from your nearest mediatheque): <a href="http://inkspots.ca/Is-on-cd.htm">http://inkspots.ca/Is-on-cd.htm</a>
   <br><br>
   Unca Marvy published  <a href="musicblogs_82005.htm">a nice book on the Ink Spots</a>.

I love coffee, I love tea
I love the java jive and it loves me
Coffee and tea and the jivin' and me
A cup, a cup, a cup, a cup, a cup!

I love java, sweet and hot
Whoops! Mr. Moto, I'm a coffee pot
Shoot me the pot and I'll pour me a shot
A cup, a cup, a cup, a cup, a cup!

Oh, slip me a slug from the wonderful mug
And I cut a rug till I'm snug in a jug
A slice of onion and a raw one, draw one.
Waiter, waiter, percolator!

I love coffee, I love tea
I love the java jive and it loves me
Coffee and tea and the jivin' and me
A cup, a cup, a cup, a cup, a cup!

Boston bean, soy bean
Green bean, string green bean.
I'm not keen for a bean
Unless it is a cheery cheery  bean boy.

I love coffee, I love tea
I love the java jive and it loves me
Coffee and tea and the jivin' and me
A cup, a cup, a cup, a cup, a cup!

I love java, sweet and hot
Whoops! Mr. Moto, I'm a coffee pot
Shoot me the pot and I'll pour me a shot
A cup, a cup, a cup, a cup, a cup!

Oh, slip me a slug from the wonderful mug
And I cut a rug till I'm snug in a jug
Drop me a nickel in my pot, Joe, Takin' it slow.
Waiter, waiter, percolator!

I love coffee, I love tea
I love the java jive and it loves me
Coffee and tea and the jivin' and me
A cup, a cup, a cup, a cup, a cup!
