<pre>Here you will find a php network security scanner. Actually 2
files are  included :
- <font color=blue>[</font><a href="#scan">scan.php3</a><font color=blue>]</font>: a very
simple port scanner.
- <font color=blue>[</font><a href="#cgiscan">cgi-scan.php3</a><font color=blue>]</font>: a
cgi scanner (111 checks)
I might write some more soon but for now I don't have more time to spend on it :-(

Why a php scanner ?

Many free web hosting companies are proposing a php support for your web pages.
While you can forget about cgi's for security reasons, many trust php to be a
more secure language. In fact it is not.
And we are not even talking about variables here.
Firstly because it allows you to scan networks while the source of the scan
appears to be the the person hosting the script. Secondly because by chaining
proxies the person using the script might remain anonymous.
And finally because poorly configured hosts might alloud a local port scan while
denying remote scans.
3 reasons to write a php network scanner.
Both scripts are very simple, they were just made quickly to demonstrate a new
problem.
The port scanner goes in 5 lines code that is:
for($port = $from; $port &lt;= $to; $port++)
{
$fp = fsockopen("$host", $port);
if ($fp)
{
print("port $port opened \r");
fclose($fp);
}

Obviously you can't scan more than 40 000 ports at the time (time limitations).
The cgi scanner checks only for a file and if it gets a "200 OK" it will tell
you what file was found.
It's simple but it works.</pre>

<center><font size=+2>DQ's comments to Devergranne's essay</font></center><hr width=44%>
<BR>Devergranne, I had a look at your essay "a php network security scanner" and
like to make some comments. You can hit me afterwards ;-)<BR><BR>Let's first start with
cgi-scan.php3. That's a nice CGI scanner, but I would <u>strongly</u> advise anyone against
using it!<BR><BR>Is that code copyrighted by yourself? Are you the author or did you just do
a rewrite, taking sources out of the web and translating them into PHP? There's something
called <a href="http://www.deepquest.pf/cgicheck99.htm">CGIcheck99</a>, which is coded in
REBOL and written by deepquest.<BR><BR>Anyway, before running that CGI scanner, please have
a look at the excellent specifications for <a
href="http://the.wiretapped.net/security/vulnerability-scanning/whisker/whisker.txt">Whisker
</a>, done by <a href="mailto:rfp@wiretrip.net">rain forest puppy</a>.<BR><BR>As a general
advice to those who just want to start with this stuff: Please be aware of the inner
workings of the servers you want to attack. Study them, learn the configuration options,
know about <u>booby-traps</u>, and please stop scanning for the phf
vulnerability!<BR><BR>Now regarding scan.php3. Please resolve the host name to an IP
<u>before</u> starting your loop through your XXXX ports, that way you contribute to reduce
internet pollution. Relevant functions are:<BR>string gethostbyname(string
hostname);<BR>array gethostbynamel(string hostname);<BR><BR>Second point: Do you really want
to scan all those ports? What are you going to do once you found an open port? Why don't you
just create an array with those ports you really care about?<BR>For example, if you want to
scan for available services, include 21, 23, 25, 80, 110, etc.<BR>If you want to check for
proxy access, include 80, 81, 3128, 8080, 8081, etc.<BR>If you want to check for SubSeven
and other backdoors, include only <u>those</u> relevant ports.<BR><BR>Just scanning from
zero to who knows what glorious 5 digit number just wastes your patience, increases your
phone bill and does nothing useful.<BR><BR>A quick patch would be to reduce the default
timeout of ten seconds to 3 in the fsockopen() line as follows:<BR>$fp = fsockopen("$host",
$port, &$errno, &$errstr, 3);<BR><BR>Nevertheless, you have a point when demonstrating this
new security problem. Perhaps this activates the awareness of people regarding PHP.<br>
