<br><br><i>
Behold reversers' foresight, tremble before their insider knowledge...</i>
<br><br>
</center>
<br>Thank-you for the invitation. Please excuse three shortcomings of mine: <br>1) English is not even my first foreign language, so bear with me 
for my language shortcomings<br>2) I'm not and 
I'm not going to be politically correct, so bear with me for my attitude shortcomings<br>3) I won't use any boring powerpoint style presentation, 
 so bear with me for my formal shortcomings<br><br> 
       I am happy to speak -once again- to a bunch of reversers. I like reversers. Today I intend to discuss with you some 'alternative'  
       searching techniques. As a proof of concept we will search  some assembly books, given that 
       assembly knowledge is a most powerful weapon, and in  doing so 
       we will, maybe, demonstrate a) that everything is on the web; b) that you can  search effectively even without google; 
       c) that  some "alternative searching paths" can be quite useful for seekers.<br>
       Of course we will find anything: whatever. Any book you fancy is there for the take. In fact <font color=blue>anything that may have been digitized</font>:
        books, music, films, software, is 
       there for the take. And not only "tangible" targets. <font color=blue>Solutions</font> ar there for the take. 
       Ideas. Methods. Techniques. Line of attacks. 
       Tactics.  
        Approaches. Strategies...<IMG SRC="images/bulletr.gif" ALT="red" align="bottom" valign="bottom" WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="13">  <bR>  But we won't overdo it today. We'll just search some assembly-related books. 
       And we will find our targets, of course: we will find our books. 
      <br>Note that somebody, some time ago, told me -politely- that we should not download  books that  are patented, or have not  yet 
       been released in the public domain. OK. I can understand that, as silly and strange as it sounds: in fact patents and 
       copyrights are just ways to negate all freedom of speech. Remember Freenet: 
       <a target=_top href="http://freenet.sourceforge.net/index.php?page=philosophy">You cannot 
      guarantee freedom of speech if you enforce copyright law</a>...<IMG SRC="images/bulletr.gif" ALT="red" align="bottom" valign="bottom" WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="13"> 
      <bR> But "today let's obey", for the sake of pur experiment, and
       therefore we will just have an innocent look at our targets <u>on line</u>. Don't download forbidden fruits, please,  
       this whole talk is just an exercise, 
       aimed at empowering reversers,  giving them some sprinkles of <font color=blue>web-seeking cosmic power</font>. 
       You should become seekers, not leechers.
<br><br>
(In general) reversers are a  bunch of 'matter of fact' fellows: their most 
peculiar endowment is the capacity to reverse any "coded reality" around them.<br>In  a world of codes noone is supposed to understand, reversers 
are among the very few that have the decoding knowledge or -maybe even better- the capacity <font color=blue>to find out any necessary  
	decoding knowledge</font>...<IMG SRC="images/bulletr.gif" ALT="red" align="bottom" valign="bottom" WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="13">
<br> 
As a consequence of the useless 'commercialisation' and hypermarketing of the web, some important searching tools, like the <a href="main.htm">main</a> search 
engines, are less and less capable of delivering useful results. This is -alas- true for google as well, whose results have kept getting 
worse  over the last months, mainly due to the growing spamming and link-farming activities of the <a href="links.htm#SE0beasts">SEO beasts</a>.<bR>
Since google is the most used among the main search engines, today's talk will concentrate on google's limits, 
but I surely do not intend to blame only google for problems that in most cases all other search engines have as well.  
<br>
 
Note that google-marketing hypes, like google being 'your friend', or google being 'the mother 
of all modern search engines', with a 'nice brand' face and a 'commitment  to the 
community of searchers', do not mean anything to us. Frills and hypes never work with reversers. 
<br>Google is just another commercial bastard without soul...  
exactly like microsoft. The only difference is that google is (still) waay more useful than microsoft for knowledge gathering purposes.
<br><br>
We use search engines as starting tools, 
in order to gather knowledge, and we use  tools only as long as they are useful and 'deliver' results. 
As soon as they become useless, we ditch them without regrets and switch to different ones. 
<br>
This happened five years ago with <a target=_top href="http://www.altavista.com/">altavista</a>, once upon a time the 
favourite seekers' search engine (note that altavista still has a 
powerful & useful Boolean <a target=_top href="http://www.altavista.com/web/results?itag=ody&q=download+NEAR++%28assembly+AND+programming%29&kgs=1&kls=0">NEAR</a> operator, btw), 
and it may happen anew and again with google. <i>Panta rei</i>.<bR>
The real point is that the <a href="main.htm">main search engines</a> are 
just ONE among <u>many possible ways</u> to search the web. As we will see together today. And the main search engines 
are not the  friendliest tools for searching purposes either... just remember the very REASONS they exist...<IMG SRC="images/bulletr.gif" ALT="red" align="bottom" valign="bottom" WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="13">
<br><br>

<font color=blue>Privacy concerns</font> are only a small part of the "non friendliness" problem of all main search engines: 
  search engines data provide a look into people's privacy, 
but privacy awareness & consumer protection have not kept (and will never keep) 
  pace with this: if you allow private companies to collect 
 such reams of data, 
any bogus attorney with half an excuse will easily get hold of them. <br>
Just imagine the volume of personal information that  a search engine 
can provide: every search query you've ever 
made on a given computer with a given browser.<br> (That's btw a good reason by itself to use    not only 
different searching approaches, but also <u>different browsers</u> and <u>different internet access providers</u> (in general you are 
 better served <u>wardriving</u> and    
 avoiding <font color=blue>your own 
provider</font> as much as you can&nbsp;:-) ...<IMG SRC="images/bulletr.gif" ALT="red" align="bottom" valign="bottom" WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="13">
<br><br>
Searching with google, using a GSM or 
buying stuff with your credit card is always the same sad story: 
you just smear your own data around for everybody and his dog to see, gather, collate and use against you.
<br><br>
But seekers know how 
to maintain some (relative) anonymity...<IMG SRC="images/bulletr.gif" ALT="red" align="bottom" valign="bottom" WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="13">.  
<br><br>
And seekers also know how 
to maintain some (relative) speed wen searching. Your browser (<a href="tuttiope.htm">Opera</a>) is of tantamount importance for this, 
and can do wonders, if correctly trimmed...<IMG SRC="images/bulletr.gif" ALT="red" align="bottom" valign="bottom" WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="13">.
<br><br>The real problem -when searching- is not anonymity and it is not speed: it is the 
<font color=blue>relevance</font>, 
<font color=blue>coherence</font> and 
<font color=blue>reliability</font> 
of our searching results.<br><bR> 
Unfortunately we are  now in a phase where even clueless bystanders notice how google is getting spammed much too much. 
It's usefulness as the "best and only" search engine has been therefore severely reduced.<br>
This is sad, but it does not matter very much: 
we began long ago to prepare  
alternative paths to web-knowledge. Let's present some of them -today- to 
this community of distinguished reversers.

<br><br><i>
O gosh, I didn't know all these books were already in the public domain! </i>
<br><br>
</center>Ah! Assembly! The most dangerous weapon a reverser can master!<br>
The following books about assembly could represent an appropriate "quarry" for today's example queries:<br>
   <ol><li>                                                                               
<i><font color=blue>Assembly Language Step-by-Step: Programming with
DOS and Linux</fonT></i>, 
by Jeff Duntemann. (John Wiley, ISBN:0471375233), 2000<br>
A fairly old text to begin with; should be available all over the web</li><li>  
   <i><font color=blue>Linux Assembly Language Programming</fonT></i> by Bob Neveln. (Prentice Hall,  ISBN: 0130879401),  2000<br>
   Another fairly old text, hence relatively easy to find.
</li><li>

<i><font color=blue>The Art of Assembly Language</fonT></i> by Randall Hyde (a MASM expert). (No starch press, ISBN 1886411972), 2003 <br>
Our target is the 'published edition' of this book, which is also <u>freely available 
on the web</u> <a target=_top href="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/AoA/Windows/index.html">in html, pdf and chm format</a><br>
(This book should not be confounded with "<i><a target=_top href="http://aod.reverse-engineering.net/">The Art of Disassembly</a></i>", by my friend Zero and alia) </li><li>
<i><font color=blue>Professional Assembly Language</fonT></i> by Richard Blum. (Wrox, ISBN: 0764579010), 2005</li>
	<li>   <i><font color=blue>Disassembling Code IDA Pro and SoftICE</fonT></i> by Vlad Pirogov (A-List, ISBN: 1931769516), 2005<bR>
		the last two examples will show how  even relatively recent books can  easily be found.
	
	  </lI>
	</ol>
	Now, of course
	we all know that 'printed' books on such matters are often both obsolete and   superficial, 
	and we also know  that the best knowledge (and material) about assembly is to be found   instead 
	in some 'grey areas' of the web, for instance visiting <a target=_top href="http://win32assembly.online.fr/">Iczelion's wondrous 
	site</a>  or my friend Woodman's  <a target=_top href="http://www.woodmann.com/forum/index.php">incredible repositories</a>. 
	<br>This query is just a proof of concept, the specific quarries don't matter that much: you'll be able to adapt the  following 
	approaches to OTHER, different, targets of yours...  
	
	    replace for instance "assembly" with "python" and you'll obtain a library of python books instead. Or whatever. 
	    The approaches and the techniques we will see  together 
	    are important, the targets themselves are irrelevant.
	<bR>
	<bR>As you will see another interesting side effect of a correct web-seeking approach 
	is  that often, when searching for something, you will find on the same servers 
	<font color=blue>many other targets related to your topic that you did not even know existed</fonT>. Imagine you are  
	retrieving a book inside a library, so that you can have a look at the books -related to the same topic- that are 
	<font color=blue>physically  located on the same shelf, next to your target</fonT> 
	when you arrive to pick it up...<IMG SRC="images/bulletr.gif" ALT="red" align="bottom" valign="bottom" WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="13"> <hr width=55% align=left>

       <br>  Searching for <a href="books.htm">books</a> on the web is -most of the time- extremely simple. <br>
       Please note that -in general- you can find most targets just inputting a title "tel quel" in any search engine: for instance a simple 
       query <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Reversing%3A+Secrets+of+Reverse+Engineering%22&num=100&safe=off&hl=en&lr=&ie=ISO-8859-1&btnG=Google">"Reversing: Secrets of Reverse Engineering"</a>
       will  almost immediately give us <a target=_top href="http://madchat.org/windoz/reversing/Reversing%20Secrets%20of%20Reverse%20Engineering.pdf">Eilam's   brick (complete)</a>, 
       quite useful -if you bother to print it- to fix the height of your screen.
       <br>
        <br>Therefore, let's begin with our <font color=blue>first</fonT> target 
       simply inputting 
       <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=opera&rls=en&q=%22Assembly+Language+Step-by-Step:+Programming+with+DOS+and+Linux%22&sourceid=opera&num=100&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8"><i>Assembly Language Step-by-Step: Programming with DOS and Linux</i></a>
       
        in google <font color=blue>tel quel</font>... and whoop!  
       We receive  SERPs full of clowns that want to "sell" us this target&nbsp;:-(  
       <br>Now -in theory- I should say 'see how useless is google', and show you how to find this book without using google.<br>
       Unfortunately (for the purposes of this talk) adding a simple <font color=blue>&as_filetype=pdf</font> 
       to this 'tel quel' searchstring we can fetch through google 
       the  complete pdf 
       version of this target <a href="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=&num=100&hl=en&rls=en&btnG=Google+Search&as_epq=Assembly+Language+Step+by+Step+Programming+with+DOS+and+Linux&as_oq=&as_eq=&lr=&as_ft=i&as_filetype=pdf&as_qdr=all&as_occt=any&as_dt=i&as_sitesearch=&as_rights=&safe=images">at once</a>, 
       	much too easy! Go figure! 
         <bR><font size=-1>
         hxxp://www.coltech.vnu.edu.vn/ttmt/ebooks/John.Wiley.And.Sons.Assembly.Language.Step-by-Step.Programming.with.DOS.and.Linux.Second.Edition.iNT.eBook-DDU.pdf
       </fonT><br> 
       Well what can we do? This was too easy. Since we landed here, let's have a look at the folder where we found this 
       target. Let's  'peel back the URL-onion', something you should routinely do, and -see- we'll land here:<br><a target=_top href="http://www.coltech.vnu.edu.vn/ttmt/ebooks/">http://www.coltech.vnu.edu.vn/ttmt/ebooks/</a>
<br><br>   Woah! A whole collection. 
Quod erat demonstrandi. And now we have already found our <font color=blue>second</fonT> book: <a target=_top href="http://www.coltech.vnu.edu.vn/ttmt/ebooks/Prentice%20Hall%20-%20Linux%20Assembly%20Language%20Programming.rar"><i>Linux 
	Assembly Language Programming</i></a>, Prentice Hall.  Two bingos with just one arrow.<br>


<br><br>
For our <font color=blue>third</fonT> target  <i>The Art of Assembly Language</i> by Randall Hyde, a simple google <a href="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=&num=100&hs=ugr&hl=en&client=opera&rls=en&btnG=Google+Search&as_epq=The+Art+of+Assembly+Language&as_oq=&as_eq=&lr=&as_ft=i&as_filetype=pdf&as_qdr=all&as_occt=any&as_dt=i&as_sitesearch=&as_rights=&safe=images">tel quel</a> 
query won't apparently deliver any useful results.<br>
Good. Let's try an alternative, non-google, 
(classical) approach to this kind of quarry using MSN Search and its very useful sliders and looking for one of the many possible <a href="local.htm#reposi">file 
	repository</a> target, for instance 'rapidshare':<br><font size=-1>                                  
<a href="http://search.msn.com/results.aspx?q=%7Bfrsh%3D94%7D+%7Bmtch%3D69%7D+%7Bpopl%3D33%7D+rapidshare+%22Art+of+Assembly+language%22&FORM=QBRE">http://search.msn.com/results.aspx?q=%7Bfrsh%3D94%7D+%7Bmtch%3D69%7D+%7Bpopl%3D33%7D+rapidshare+%22Art+of+Assembly+language%22&FORM=QBRE</a>
</fonT>
<br>
Please notice the <font color=blue>{frsh=94} {mtch=69} {popl=33}</font> in the 
querystring...<IMG SRC="images/bulletr.gif" ALT="red" align="bottom" valign="bottom" WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="13">

<br>The rapidshare query worked: here we already have <a target=_top href="http://www.comms.scitech.susx.ac.uk/fft/books/ArtOfAsm_HLA.pdf"><i>The Art of Assembly 
	Language</i></a>, our third target (beta draft: do not distribute). It is worth noting that
	 this result was retrievable through google as well, just massaging 
	the querystring a little: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=opera&rls=en&q=ebook+%22The+Art+Of+Assembly+Language%22+%22No+Starch+Press%22&sourceid=opera&num=100&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8">ebook "The Art Of Assembly Language" "No Starch Press"</a>.
	<br>
	Another possible approach is to use a phrase from the text itself: a text-snippet. 
	In google: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&hs=EcZ&hl=en&lr=&client=opera&rls=en&as_qdr=all&q=%22Hello%2C+World+of+Assembly+Language%22&btnG=Search">"Hello, World of Assembly Language"</a>, 
	or in yahoo: <a target=_top href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=%22Hello%2C+World+of+Assembly+Language%22&prssweb=Search&ei=UTF-8&n=10&fl=0&x=wrt">"Hello, World of Assembly Language"</a>. 
	This is the preferred method to fetch on-line html (or pdf) editions (also non *.zip, *.rar or *.chm files). 
	<bR>The "complete snippet" trick is most useful for 
	fiction books. You want Harry Potter? Have it: 
	<bR><font size=-1><a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=%22There+was+a+definite+end-of-the-holidays+gloom+in+the+air+when+Harry+awoke+next++morning.+Heavy+rain+was+still+splattering+against+the+window+as+he+got+dressed+in++jeans+and+a+sweatshirt%3B+they+would+change+into+their+school+robes+on+the+Hogwarts++Express.%22&prssweb=Search&ei=UTF-8&fr=FP-tab-web-t&x=wrt">"There was a definite end-of-the-holidays gloom in the air when Harry awoke next  morning. Heavy rain was still splattering against the window as he got dressed in  jeans and a sweatshirt; they would change into their school robes on the Hogwarts  Express."</a></fonT><bR>
	 and it does not have to be so long, of course:<br> <a href="http://www.alltheweb.com/search?cat=web&cs=utf8&q=%22There+was+a+definite+end-of-the-holidays+gloom%22&rys=0&itag=crv&_sb_lang=pref">"There was a definite end-of-the-holidays gloom"</a> 
	 will suffice, albeit including some beastly spammers in the SERPs. 

   <br><br>
   Let's now try our <font color=blue>fourth</fonT> example: <i>Professional Assembly Language</i> by Richard Blum, searching 
   in google 
   <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&hs=WuE&hl=en&client=opera&rls=en&as_qdr=all&q=+%22Professional+Assembly+Language%22&btnG=Search&lr=">tel quel</a> 
   we fetch a lot of commercial noise, but with the simplest trick (adding a geographical limitation) if we search
   
   <a href="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=&num=100&hs=iZZ&hl=en&client=opera&rls=en&btnG=Google+Search&as_epq=Professional+Assembly+Language&as_oq=&as_eq=&lr=lang_ru&as_ft=i&as_filetype=&as_qdr=all&as_occt=any&as_dt=i&as_sitesearch=&as_rights=&safe=images">tel quel in russia</a>, we 
   fetch this target at once.  It may be worth noting in this context that when perusing 
   your search results it is ALWAYS a good idea <font color=blue>to open the cached version</fonT> of a target first,  
   and only then consider using the original link. This saves bandwidth (most crap goes away), 
   saves time (interesting servers are usually slow or overloaded), and does not unnecesaryly increase the popularity of the target URL...<IMG SRC="images/bulletr.gif" ALT="red" align="bottom" valign="bottom" WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="13"> 
   &nbsp; So, in this case, a possible link (among many) would be 
   <a target=_top href="http://66.249.93.104/search?q=cache:45kcLLqeyd0J:avaxhome.ru/ebooks/professional_assembly_language_2.html">http://66.249.93.104/search?q=cache:45kcLLqeyd0J:avaxhome.ru/ebooks/professional_assembly_language_2.html</a>.
   <br>
     <br>  
             Finally, for our <font color=blue>fifth</fonT> title, we just try a "chinese" search: 
             <a href="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=&num=100&hs=sKy&hl=en&rls=en&btnG=Google+Search&as_epq=Disassembling+Code+IDA+Pro+and+SoftICE&as_oq=&as_eq=&lr=lang_zh-CN&as_ft=i&as_filetype=&as_qdr=all&as_occt=any&as_dt=i&as_sitesearch=&as_rights=&safe=images"> "Disassembling Code IDA Pro and SoftICE"</a>, 
             note the     <font color=blue>&lr=lang_zh-CN</fonT> snippet.<bR>
             And  <a target=_top href="http://www.7622.com/booken/859.htm">bingo</a>!  <bR>A possible alternative for our fifth title 
             is the <font color=blue> adding "htm" or "html"</fonT> searching trick. 
             Here an example with yahoo: <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=disassembling-code-ida-pro-and-softice.html&prssweb=Search&ei=UTF-8&fr=FP-tab-web-t&x=wrt">disassembling-code-ida-pro-and-softice.html</a> 
     
     <bR><bR>
   Note that we could also search <font color=blue>all our titles together</fonT> with a nice "potpourri" approach. 
   <br><font size=+2>Potpourri searches</font><br>     
        
        At times simply guessing that interesting places MUST have all your targets on the same page can
        be useful... in order to find interesting places <u>and</u> your targets&nbsp;:-) 
        <br>Here a "potpourri"  example:  
         <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=opera&rls=en&q=%22Disassembling+Code+:+IDA+Pro+and+SoftICE%22+%22Professional+Assembly+Language%22&sourceid=opera&num=100&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8">"Disassembling Code : IDA Pro and SoftICE" "Professional Assembly Language"</a>
               
<br><br>  
   
     Anyway, as you have seen, any and every book is at seekers' disposal.
       <br><br>
      

    (<u>Caveat</u>: <font color="#191970">Please download these books only if you are positively sure they have been released 
on the public domain. 
Real seekers do not need to waste harddisk space downloading dubious stuff. Besides it could even be constructed as 'illegal' by the beastly patents 
holders and their political lackeys. <font color=blue>Downloading is not necessary!</fonT> Seekers will always find again and again on the fly 
-and consult on line- 
whatever they fancy</fonT>).
<br>      




<br>Ok, ok. It was too easy. Much too easy. In order to continue 
let's imagine for a moment that it would NOT have been so excessively easy to find these books through such simple searches. 
Imagine we could not find them.  Imagine we will not find them again on those specific URLs. 
<br>After all <font color=blue>the web is a quicksand</font> and the specific locations where we found these  targets could 
soon disappear (and in fact probably will, after today's talk&nbsp;:-)

<font size=+2>Let's  find again our 'assembly' targets WITHOUT using the simple querystrings above
	</fonT></center>
<br></center>

<ul><LI>We could go for the  <u>format</u>.<br> For obvious reasons, given that our quarry are books, the most probable formats will be 
<font color=blue>.chm</fonT>,
<font color=blue>.pdf</fonT>,
<font color=blue>.rar</fonT> (or <font color=blue>.zip</fonT> or <font color=blue>.ace</fonT>). 
<br>
Of course we could 
take advantage of this through google as well: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&q=-inurl%3Ahtm+-inurl%3Ahtml+intitle%3A%E2%80%9Dindex+of%E2%80%9D+%2B%28%E2%80%9C%2Febooks%E2%80%9D%7C%E2%80%9D%2Fbook%E2%80%9D%29+%2B%28chm%7Cpdf%7Czip%29+%2B%E2%80%9Dassembly%E2%80%9D&btnG=Search">-inurl:htm -inurl:html intitle:”index of” +(“/ebooks”|”/book”) +(chm|pdf|zip) +”assembly”</a>.
<br>
    Here a similar query for yahoo: <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?_adv_prop=web&x=op&ei=UTF-8&fr=op&va=%2B%28%E2%80%9C%2Febooks%E2%80%9D%7C%E2%80%9D%2Fbook%E2%80%9D%29++%2B%E2%80%9Dassembly%E2%80%9D&va_vt=any&vp=%22index+of%22&vp_vt=title&vo_vt=any&ve_vt=title&vd=all&vst=0&vf=pdf&vm=i&fl=0&n=10">+(“/ebooks”|”/book”) +”assembly” intitle:"index of"</a> 
    (note the <font color=blue>&vf=pdf</fonT> inside the querystring).
<br>
Let's examine these two querystrings step by step... <IMG SRC="images/bulletr.gif" ALT="red" align="bottom" valign="bottom" WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="13">
<br>
<br></li>

                                            		Now, even if these specific repositories' URLs disappear, and they will, you already 
                                            		have  the golden  
                                            		<a href="nomomen.htm">names</a>, and hence the keys to find these files again and again whenever 
                                            		you want.     Note also that some <a href="magicfi.htm">guessing</a> can be useful 
                                            		when searching a target on the web. WPAL is clearly the acronym of  
                                            		Wrox.Professional.Assembly.Language, but the author name, Richard Blum, could also be used, hence
                                            		
            <font color=blue>RBlum.rar</fonT>,    <font color=blue>RBlum.zip</fonT>,    <font color=blue>RBlum.pdf</fonT> are all possible

  <br>
<br></li>

<li>We could do it like  <u>lamers</u>.<br>
  	
  	The lamers' way: using <a href="ftp.htm">P2P</a> and torrents<br> Using <a href="p2p.htm#search">P2P specific search engines</a>  
     is a somehow banal, but often useful way to find your targets.<bR>
     Let's <I>exempli gratia</i> give <a target=_top href="http://www.filedonkey.com/search">filedonkey</a> a chance:   
     let's just input <a target=_top href="http://www.filedonkey.com/search/assembly">assembly</a> and see what we fish. See?<br>
     Another "lame but valid" possibility is of course to check what <a target=_top href="http://www.bitenova.nl/search.php">torrents</a> can deliver 
     when you search -say- <a target=_top href="http://www.torrentspy.com/search.asp?h=&query=assembly&submit.x=22&submit.y=7">assembly</a>.<br>
     Anyhow real seekers        <font color=blue>deprecate</fonT>   P2P and Torrents "searches". It is always 
     <font color=blue>much quicker</fonT>  and more elegant    
     to fetch your targets from URL locations    nobody is visiting, than to slowly download them from overwhelmed servers together with 
     a zillion other zombies doing the same thing.

	We could search  <u>elsewhere</u><bR><bR>
	
	<ol>
		  
		
		<li>
<a href="ftp.htm">FTP</a><br> 
Using <a href="ftp.htm#search">ftp specific search engines</a> is in many cases a good way to quickly find your targets.
Let's give <a target=_top href="http://www.files.lt/?">our lithuanian friends</a> a chance:   let's just input <font color=blue>professional assembly</fonT>.<br>
Here we have two results: <font color=blue>217.16.23.33 root/books/edocs/Wrox</fonT> (in rar format) and        <font color=blue>85.30.196.165 root/pub/Info/Books/_ebuki.powernews.ru_/_downloads_/downloads.ebuki.apvs.ru/Wrox</fonT> (in pdf format).
  <br>
  We could also try Dalian's ftp: <a target=_top href="http://banyan.dlut.edu.cn/cgi-bin/parker/cgi?query=assembly&search=substring&select=200&sortby=hosts&Submit=Searché">assembly</a>        
                           <bR><bR>
  </li>
  
    


<li> 
	
	Going <a href="local.htm">local</a> (<a href="local.htm">Homepages, Usenet, topic-related messageboards & Webrings</a>)<br> 
 At times it can be useful to "throw a narrow net" in the searchscape, going  "specific".<br> 
 Searching <a target=_top href="http://s2.webring.com/cgi-bin/hubsearch?search">webrings</a> you'll discover that there's a
 <a target=_top href="http://x.webring.com/hub?ring=x86asm">x86 Assembly Language Webring</a> and  
 the     <a target=_top href="http://m.webring.com/hub?ring=win32asm">Win32Asm ring</a>. <bR>
 On <a href="usenet.htm">usenet</a> you have <a target=_top href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.asm.x86?lnk=sg&hl=en">comp . lang . asm . x86 </a>, 
  <a target=_top href="http://groups.google.com/group/alt.lang.asm?lnk=rgh&hl=en">alt . lang . asm</a> and
 <a target=_top href="http://groups.google.com/group/alt.os.assembly?lnk=srg&hl=en">alt . os . assembly</a> (this last -alas- spammed to death).
 <bR>      
 You could also <a target=_top href="http://us.geocities.yahoo.com/search?p=%22Assembly+Language%22">Search private homepages</a> 
 or <a target=_top href="http://search.aol.com/aolcom/search?invocationType=topsearchbox.search&query=%22assembly+language%22">AOL</a> 
 for "assembly language".   <br><bR>
 A further very good idea is to individuate  
 relevant and authoritative topic-related messageboards. There you may even find topic-related specific search engines, 
 like  for instance <a target=_top href="http://community.reverse-engineering.net/viewtopic.php?t=5201&highlight=assembly">community.reverse-engineering.net</A> 
 and   <a target=_top href="http://www.woodmann.com/forum/index.php">woodman's</a>.<bR>
 It is worth underlining that on the web much knowledge can be found in "grey areas" that are completely outside the "academic circuits". 
 In fact if you are  interested in assembly you'll soon realise that the four books we have chosen as targets today are 
  obsolete 
 and quite irrelevant if compared with the knowledge you can gather visiting the messageboards pointed out above.
 
   <br><bR>
   
   </li><li>Going <a href="regional.htm">regional</a><br><table border="0" width=88%><tr><td><font size=+1>  
    Going "regional" is ALWAYS a very good idea when searching. We have already seen how adding a simple <font color=blue>.ru</font> to 
    our queries can help. But WHERE should we search? Which are the, how should I say? the "less copyright-obsessed" countries? Here on the right you can 
    see a interesting 
    "piracy subdivision"  published a week ago by <a target=_top href="http://www.economist.com/markets/indicators/index_wide.cfm?page=Emerging%20Market&story_id=7039860">The

      Ok, ok, I know: obviously this kind of bogus "home made" researches, promoted 
      by US-lobbyist Robert Holleyman's  "Business Software  alliance", are clearly just intended to scare 
      the pants off some corporate clown in order to scrap some money, yet   
       since we are reversers, we may as well <font color=blue>reverse such data for our own purposes</fonT>...&nbsp;:-)<bR>
      And look! As you can see,      Vietnam, Zimbabwe, Indonesia, China, Pakistan, Kazakistan, Ukraine, Cameroon, 
      Russia, Bolivia, Paraguay and Algeria seem indeed to have a more relaxed attitude towards the  
        "patents mafiosi". Good to know&nbsp;:-)<bR>
      Here the relevant <a target=_top href="http://www.iana.org/cctld/cctld-whois.htm">country codes</a>: 
             <font color=blue>.vn</fonT>, <font color=blue>.zw</fonT>, <font color=blue>.id</fonT>, <font color=blue>.cn</fonT>,

             that we could use to <font color=blue>restrict searches</fonT> to such relaxed places.
             <bR>
             Of course some of these countries are just "local niches" with next to inexistent activity and 
             extremely weak signals, and can be ignored. 
             <bR>
             Let's say that -in general-    
             <font color=blue>.vn</fonT>(Vietnam),
             <font color=blue>.id</fonT> (Indonesia),   <font color=blue>.cn</fonT> (China),  <font color=blue>.pk</fonT> (Pakistan),
                      <font color=blue>.ua</fonT> (Ukraine) and   <font color=blue>.ru</fonT> (Russia) look promising enough.  We may add
                      to these countries  
                      -out of experience-   
                      Iran, Korea, Bulgaria and India (<font color=blue>.ir</fonT>, <font color=blue>.kr</fonT>, <font color=blue>.bg</fonT> and <font color=blue>.in</fonT>).

<a href="irc.htm">IRC</a> channels and <a href="blog.htm">blogs</a><br> 
Searching through <acronym title="Internet Relay Chat -  a multi-user chat system, where people convene on 'channels'">IRC</acronym> channels and blogs can be -for some targets- quite useful.       However the ratio noise/signal is
quite bad on these channels, and therefore IRC-searching and blog-searching is -mostly- a 
waste of time if compared with more effective searching

    <br>After all, and behind the hype, blogs are just messageboards where only the Author can start a thread.

Many clueless zombies consider "searching the web" tantamount to digit one term inside google and then clicking enter.
<br>
In fact such a simplistic approach is as wrong as it may get. And not only for the "one-termness" of it.
The real problem is that google <font color=blue>covers only a tiny part</fonT> of the web. 
<bR><br>
The power of its servers and the beautiful simplicity of its interface 
notwithstanding, <a href="google.htm">google</a> is only one of the many main search engines, and its database, 
while currently already past the 
20 billions sites mark, covers at most one third of the visible web (and less than 1/50th of the "invisible" one). In fact 
Yahoo's database is bigger (albeit saddled with a lot of useless commercial crap).
<br>
The web is just too big for a single search index alone, and  still growing quickly. Moreover 
the "invisible" web content "the real bulk of the web" is hidden behind 
firewalls or commercial services (that will try to restrict access 
asking for "subscriptions" 
or "money" or a "valid id").<bR> 
In order to access (part of) it you will need to use techniques that go from <a href="stalking.htm">stalking</a> to <a href="luring.htm">social 
engineering</a>, 
through <a href="trolls.htm">trolling</a> and <a href="password.htm">passwords breaking</a>.</td><td> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</tD><td align=right><center>

<br><br>
Note also that <font color=blue>links</font> (the food used by all search engines, and especially by google, in their algos) 
does not convey any real <font color=blue>meaning</font>. <br>
In fact a link, <i>per se</i>, does not mean nothing, you can just count 
the number of links, as most search engines in fact do, and then try to decide what those links really mean using 
a bunch of  "best-guess" algos. A rather crude 
approach if you ask me: this gives all advantages to the beastly spammers, none to the users.
<br>
Of course some correct developments are already under way: 
users -rather than spammers- should be able to influence the ranking of search results and some 
search engines (MSNsearch's <a href="http://search.msn.com/results.aspx?q=%7Bfrsh%3D94%7D+%7Bpopl%3D20%7D+%7Bmtch%3D99%7D+rapidshare.de%2Ffiles+google&FORM=QBRE">sliders</a> 
and Yahoo's <a target=_top href="http://mindset.research.yahoo.com/search.php?p=%22advanced+web+searching%22&t=2.00">philtron</a>) already 
provide users with such a possibility 
of influencing -at least rudimentary- their own ranking algorithms. 
<br>
A classical case is the infamous 'popularity' ranking criterion. This you should by all means slide to insignificancy, since 
it is <i>eo ipso</i> tantamount to crappiness.
<br>
 Contrary to 
what search engines' algos designer still seem to believe, we  immediately <font color=blue>TURN POPULARITY DOWN</fonT> if given half a 
chance, since what -say-  some idiots in Idaho are massively looking for 
has no relevance whatsoever for  humans with brains.   "Sites popular for zombies" are exactly those you never need. Remember the beautiful 
 old trick of adding a <font color=blue>-".com"</fonT> specification to all your searchstrings per default: 
 all the com sites will disappear: good riddance.
 <bR><br>
 For search engines that do not allow any algo fine-tuning, a possible approach is the "<a href="yoyo1.htm">yo-yo</a>" approach: 
 jumping  from the start 
 onto lower <acronym title="Search Engines Result Pages">SERP</acronym>s.
<br><br> 
The old "best-guess" and link related algos are what makes life so easy for 
the beastly spammers:
 google's results, after many years of legendary quality, are
nowadays  being spammed more and more by the beastly commercial clowns that call themselves  "Search engines optimizers".<br> 
Using a plethora of methods (cloaking, doorway pages, hidden text, blog-farms, you name it) 
these criminals deny everybody the possibility to gather  real knowledge 
 in order to push up 
their crap commercial sites into the first positions of the <acronym title="Search Engines Result Pages">SERP</acronym>s.<br><br>
In fact, searchers are directly affected by these criminal deeds. As even SEO-spammers  
managed to admit: 
 "searchers have something to gain if they obtain the search results that best match their queries and, 
 consequently, something to lose if they cannot do this".<br>
<acronym title="Search Engines Optimizators">SEO</acronym>s, these "Judas of the web" sell -for money- their knowledge and insights  of search  algos' weaknesses in order to purposely   
deliver 
dubious and crap results to our queries...  
<i>Quelle vulgarité</i>! 
<br><br>
Acquiring a working knowledge 
of the many alternative searching paths is <i>eo ipso</i> useful and may already now allow even beginners 
to find valuable results more quickly  and reliably.
<br><br>
Such alternatives can soon prove 
even more crucial for Internet searching purposes:
 while google may not be yet a sinking boat, anyone can  
see how much water is already entering through its many holes. <br><br>
So we have <font color=blue>to reverse our own searching habits</font>.
<br>
Instead of just using google à la "va banque" every time  we 
begin a search, we should 
carefully consider <font color=blue>how and where</font>  we start our searches, delve a little more 
inside 
our searches own specific requirements, else we will waste too much time 
on irrelevant side paths... <IMG SRC="images/bulletr.gif" ALT="red" align="bottom" valign="bottom" WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="13">&nbsp; &nbsp; 
<br>
And since we are all reversers, an ancient and savvy race, 
incredibly "apt to adapt", we'll be able to reverse first and foremost ourselves and 
our own working habits. 
<br>
Google has its weaknesses and its strength, let's analyze them.
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br><br><i>
 Le plus fort est celui qui n'oublie pas sa faiblesse</i>
<br><br>
</center>
<br>

Google is/was/became the best search engine because of its clean interface in a 
frantically commercial on screen world, and BECAUSE it didn't pollute its results with advertisements and BECAUSE 
it didn't practice  any censorship whatsoever on the results. 
<br>
It is -alas- now losing ground on both last terms.<br>
Try any search for mp3s, for instance, and you'll see at once both advertisements and censorship at work... <IMG SRC="images/bulletr.gif" ALT="red" align="bottom" valign="bottom" WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="13">&nbsp;
<br>The third 'raison d'être', its effective and simple interface, still survives  somehow,
 its more and more frequent "cartoonish" cracks on the querymask logo  notwithstanding.
More annoying is the fact that 
today up to half of each SERP screen is dedicated to paid ads, compared to the ad-free original "Old-Google".<bR> 
Google's (relative) cleanliness was 
so powerfully convincing that many rivals went "back" to a similar clean approach, ditching their useless heavy-commercial portals 
(compare on <a href="reversing_our_searching_habits.htm#disapp">alexa</a> the evolution of <a target=_top href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.yahoo.com">Yahoo</a>'s portal... <IMG SRC="images/bulletr.gif" ALT="red" align="bottom" valign="bottom" WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="13">&nbsp;)
<br><br>
The biggest weakness of google, is that it's 'patented ranking algos' are now pretty well known.
Their 'secret combination' of 'thousand of algos' was all just hype from the very beginning, and  
their ranking approach -never really hidden- is now well known 
by countless commercial spammers, thus making it a liability rather than an asset.<br><br>
In the main search engines panorama there are at the moment hundreds of different 
prototypes and companies that all utilize more or less the same algos.  Yet even slight 
variations can make the difference: their results overlap only 
for a small part (around 1/4 of the SERPs do overlap). This is where the depth and freshness of 
the supporting database plays a bigger role than the cleverness of the ranking algos.
<br>
In fact (as per spring 2006) only four  contenders:  
Google, Yahoo, Microsoft and Teoma/AskJeeves  have enough muscles  to guarantee a relatively 
useful and regular indexing of the web. <br>
But -as we have seen- these four cover together, at best, just one half of the visible web and a tiny part of the invisible one.
<br>
This makes it extremely important to use alternative approaches when searching. 
<br><br>


Since google is still a useful and powerful quick search engine, and since it 
owns the whole archive of newsgroup postings, we will never be able to ditch google 
completely anyway... <IMG SRC="images/bulletr.gif" ALT="red" align="bottom" valign="bottom" WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="13">&nbsp;
<br><br> There's also a google bias towards "established sites", due to its 
links algos:  
         if you are searching content that is likely to have been on the Internet for a LONG TIME, 
         google is a good choice. On the other hand, if you are looking for "fresh" content, you better use MSNsearch (or even 
         good ole altavista). 
<bR><br>
Google's real strength is its "quality database" of useful sites. It is not a matter of the quantity of sites listed, it is a matter of  quality. 
Yahoo's database, while bigger than google's, hosts an abominable amount of ".com" sites (five times the amount of google) which 
heavily skew all results towards irrelevance. <br><bR>But how do you judge results? How do you prepare your search? 
Knowledge of some basic searching rules can help.

       There are some basic rules for seekers. Of course things are different depending from the KIND of search you are

       But almost every query can be subdivided into the following steps: <font size=+2>think, find, refine, <a href="reversing_our_searching_habits.htm#evalla">evaluate</a>, collate</font>.<bR>
      (<font color=blue>Th</font>e <font color=blue>Fi</font>nder <font color=blue>Re</font>verses <font color=blue>Ev</font>ery <font color=blue>Co</font>rner)
       <br>
       	<ol><li>
           	 <b>THINK about your query</b><bR>              
                   Seekers do not "plunge" into 
                   a search out of the blue. Like artists, they visualize the correct result 
                   before they begin. The 'perfect' answer is driving their queries. The perfect answer <u>creates</u> 
                   the correct question(s)<br>
                   What kind of results do you want? Books? Doctoral thesis? Images?
                 News?  Biographies? How many results do you want? Three hundred pages of material? 
                 One single authoritative book? A dozen pdf-articles? 
                A short and concise essay?<br>
                   Obviously you cannot be an expert in all single field of  
                   any and every query you will launch. But you must 
                   be an expert in the field of finding the right resources for 
                   each and every kind of query.
                   <br>A seeker needs TWO skills: 
                   <font color=blue>to formulate a question correctly</font> and   <font color=blue>to know where to look</font>. 
                   And this means knowing which 
                   resources you should use for your searches. And this means you must first of all know how to search those very 
                   resources you should use for your searches.<br>
                     In fact each 'part' of the 
                   web requires a different approach. For instance, searches on <a href="usenet.htm">usenet</a>, on    
                   <a href="blog.htm">blogs</a> or on <a href="ftp.htm">ftp servers</a>  are 
                   not ruled by the same <font color=blue>
                    lore</font>. 
                   Also each  <a href="targets.htm">kind of target</a>, each  quarry, 
                   requires a different approach:   for instance 
                   when searching 
                   <a href="newsfeeds.htm">news</a>, <a href="images.htm">images</a> or <a href="books.htm">books</a>.  
                   <br>You must also decide if  for a given query you will have to use 
                   <a href="combing.htm">combing</a> techniques like <a href="stalking.htm">stalking</a>, 
                  <a href="luring.htm">luring</a>     or <a href="trolls.htm">trolling</a>.
                   <br>Before even beginning, think about your query: <font color=blue>prepare your question(s)</font>
                    for the perfect result and <font color=blue>decide which resources you will use</fonT>.
           <bR><br>
</li>
<li>
	     <b>FIND what you are looking for</b><bR> Easier said than done, I know, I know.  
	           In fact this  very complex step is  at the same time the whole point of the exercise, duh. 
	           However, depending on the previous "thinking about your query" step, you will at least already know <u>where</u> you should be looking for and 
	           what kind of <u>techniques</u> you'll have to use.<bR> 
	           A general advice is to <a href="combing.htm">comb</a> as much as you can, i.e.  
	           use the knowledge that others have gathered, search those that have already searched, 
	           and do not 'reinvent the wheel' at every query.  <br>A second generally useful advice is to go '<a href="regional.htm">regional</a>' as much a you can, that is to use 
	           		information and resources that are located on the same plane (geographically, temporally, academically, conceptually)  as 
	           		your quarry.
	           		<br>Anyway, if your      <font color=blue>question has been formulated 
	           	correctly</font> and  if you already <font color=blue>know where to look</font>, the 'finding' part will not 
	           		be too hard.   
	           		 <bR><br>
</li>
<li>
	    <b>REFINE while searching</b><bR> 
	    
Your queries are usually either too wide or too narrow. Usually -in fact- they are too wide. If a subject is too wide, 
as it is most of the time, you have to limit and narrow your search. 
Using boolean operators (<font color=blue>AND</font> and <font color=blue>NOT</font> or <font color=blue>+</font> and <font color=blue>-</font>) will narrow the search adding and/or eliminating terms. You can also limit 
your query temporally (for instance only <font color=blue>2005/2006</font>), geographically 
(for instance only <font color=blue>.ru</font>) or formally (for instance only <font color=blue>.pdf</font> 
files).   <br>
These limits allow you to restrict results to items meeting specific criteria. I.e.:
 a particular type (newspaper articles, journal articles, complete books, small snippets of text); 
 a particular language (English, German, Spanish, Russian, Italian, French, etc.);  
a target published or produced within a particular time frame (2000-2004)
	     <bR><br>
</li> 
<a name="evalla"></a>
 <li>
	    <b>EVALUATE your results</b><bR>  This is easier said than done, again. The <a href="evaluate.htm">evaluation 
	  phase</a> is of paramount importance, but -alas- far from being simple. <bR>Whatever you are looking for, 
	    you are bound to find very good quality results, good quality results,    average quality results and poor quality (or no quality at all) results. 
	    This is not only due to the spam, but to the simple fact that the web allows   anyone to publish anything he fancies.<bR>
	    A possible approach to evaluation is to use as a rough evaluation guide the seven 
old classical questions: <font color=blue>quis</font>, <font color=blue>quid</font>, <font color=blue>ubi</font>, <font color=blue>quibus 
auxiliis</font>, <font color=blue>cur</font>, <font color=blue>quomodo</font>, 
<font color=blue>quando</font>: Who, What, Where, Helped by whom, Why, How and When. <br>
<br>Well, first of all you should maybe ask yourself <font color=blue>why the heck</fonT>  you need to search for something at all&nbsp;:-) <bR>
Continue only if you have an answer to this fundamental question.
<br>
<bR>If you  manage to answer the fundamental question and continue,  
whenever you find  a result, it is useful to ask yourself  for evaluation purposes 
the whole bag of classic questions.  Does not take long and helps a lot. 
<br>Let's begin: <font color=blue>quis</font> WHO is the Author (and therefore, given his 
biography,  
what qualifies him to write about the matter at hand);    <font color=blue>quid</font> WHAT is in fact the result you found 
(a complete  explanation, 
a proof of concept, a small addition, an hypothetical solution...);  check   <font color=blue>ubi</font> WHERE you did find your result (look at the URL, 
look at the server, look at the links pointing to it...); <font color=blue>quibus 
auxiliis</font>, WHO helped the Author? (look at who OWNS the server hosting the result, look at eventual references, links, etc...);
         and ask yourself <font color=blue>cur</font>: WHY the result has been produced and put on the web;  <font color=blue>quomodo</font> HOW the result 
         has been produced (again, similar to quid/what: years of research or one half-afternoon sudden jerk?);  
         and finally 
         <font color=blue>quando</font>: WHEN was the result produced/published/updated, <u>when</u> was the web site created/updated.  
         (<a target=_top href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.searchlores.org">Archive</a>  org may prove 
         <a href="reversing_our_searching_habits.htm#disapp">invaluable for such dating purposes</a>. Note that you can also retrieve a site for <a target=_top href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010418160531/www.searchlores.org/">specific date</a> of the 
         past).<bR><bR>
         Simply answering the seven classical questions  will already allow you to proceed towards a proper evaluation of a set of results. <bR>
          <bR>Finally a word about those "ready-made" evaluations you can find on the web. Should you use them? Yep, <i>Cum grano salis</i>.  
          <bR>
          First of all there's a tendency to ignore "grey areas" of the web when evaluating targets. Some seem to believe that  
          a pdf file should automagically be <i>eo ipso</i> more worthy than an html file, independently from its actual content. No way. 
          A text is not worth 
          anything just because it has been printed and published in a book.  
          Its worthiness is always and only <a href="evaluate.htm#siela">intrinsic</a>.  Many ready-made evaluations on the web 
          are blinded by frills' bells and excessive 'formal-bowing' and  utterly 
          incapable of judging content at face value.
          <bR>
          It may also be worth noting that -in general- east european places (<font color=blue>.ru</fonT>, 
                     <font color=blue>.bg</fonT>, <font color=blue>.cz</fonT> etc.) are (still) 
                     "culturally" less commercially oriented and therefore 
                     offer more "sound" valid evaluations of books/software/targets, instead of the bogus fanbois "evaluations" 
                     that are purposely  planted on -say- amazon or ebay.    In fact you can hardly find a non-paid -sorry- non-biased review 
                     or comparison of certain products on the west-side of the web.
                      <bR>
<br><br></lI>
	    
	  <li>
	    <b>COLLATE your results</b><bR> 
	   Ok, you have performed a long search. Gathered tons of results. Painstakingly weeded out bogus and crap sites, understood which are the 
	   most important authoritative results... and now you stop your search and go to sleep satisfied.<br>
	   This is a serious mistake. A query is not finished when you have found your results. Most 
	   will be lost if you don't COLLATE your results, squeezing the most authoritative 
	   results into a coherent and valid interpretation. A 'conclusion' of sort.
	   <br>Systematic record keeping is OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE when searching. A classical mistake 
 is to 'forget' to keep records during  complex searches.<br>
For this purpose I suggest you simply use the NOTE function in <a href="tuttiope.htm">Opera</a>: just highlight the target 
text you are interested in, 
rightclick, and then choose <font color=blue>copy to note</font> (or use the keyboard shortcuts, either
 CTRL+SHIFT+C or CTRL+ALT+E depending on the version of Opera you'r using): 
*the URL* of the page you'r viewing at that moment *and the date* will be automatically stored in your note 
*together with the highlighted text*.<br>
You may want to create ad hoc <font color=blue>note folders</font> (for instance 
"<font color=blue>research_assembly_books_29MAY2006</font>") and, at the 
end of your search, before switching the computer off and go to sleep, just move all your 
related notes inside some correctly named folders. 
<bR>Opera's Notes are just text format, very easy to edit, 
cat, search or prune.<br>
Alternatively use <u>something</u> to take notes, even a pen and a sheet of paper will do. DO NOT rely on your memory alone (or on your 
extraordinary seeking capabilities to re-find at once what you may have lost&nbsp;:-)<br>
If you do, you will regret it. Sooner 
than you believe.<br><br>Once you create some crumbs-paths of well kept records, collating the results will be 
a quick and easy process.<bR>
    <bR>
</lI>

<lI><b>A final note about your "searching environment"</b><bR>  Listening to music while searching   is NOT a good idea,  chatting 
	while searching is NOT a good idea, being interrupted while refining a query is verry, verry bad: 
Always search & seek <font color=blue>in a quiet and relaxed environment</fonT>, 
with as few disturbances as possible. No music, no telephone, no skype, no email distractions, no IRC, no chat 
(and of course no TV, duh). <bR>
A serene, calm atmosphere, will allow you to 
take full advantage of your seeking efforts in an optimal way.  <bR><font color=blue><center>Serenity CREATES serendipity.</center></fonT> 
This does not have to mean soberness, austerity or ascetics, though. 
If you fancy something to drink, have it ready before starting, and always chose excellent products: wines like 
<a target=_top href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomerol">pomerol</a> or <a target=_top href="http://www.sanpellegrino.com/flash_site/articolo.asp?id=997">refosco</a> or  
the most finest teas (<a target=_top href="http://www.thunderbolttea.com/pages/second_flush_darjeeling_tea.html">Darjeeling second flush</a>, for instance). 
<bR>Seekers can often fetch 
such seemingly expensive items <u>for next to nothing</u> using the  old 
usual   <a target=_top href="http://www.totse.com/en/hack/magnetic_stripes_and_other_data_formats/161810.html">barcode tricks</a>. 
<br><bR>Let's cut it short: 
Consider yourself <u><font color=blue>a monk of the early middle ages</fonT></u>, sitting in his  peaceful cell, seeking old forgotten 
knowledge, sipping good wines, while barbarians and zombies are burning everything in sight and torturing each other
 not far from the abbey's walls...  consider yourself a monk of the early middle ages among barbarians

<br>  The various techniques described above can and should be used together with the <a href="quickforms.htm">main</a> 
search engines:       on the ever moving web-quicksands 
it does not make much sense to give a "list of links" to places where you can 
"alternatively search". 
<br>
Of course there are various important <u>non commercial</u> databases, like Infomine (<a target=_top href="http://infomine.ucr.edu">http://infomine.ucr.edu</a>), 
Librarians Internet Index (<a target=_top href="http://lii.org">http://lii.org</a>), The Internet Public Library (<a target=_top href="http://www.ipl.org/">http://www.ipl.org/</a>) Resource Discovery Network (<a target=_top href="http://rdn.ac.uk">http://rdn.ac.uk</a>), 
Academic Info (<a target=_top href="http://www.academicinfo.net/">http://www.academicinfo.net/</a>), The Front (for journals: <a target=_top href="http://www.arxiv.org/multi?group=math&%2Ffind=Search">http://www.arxiv.org/multi?group=math&%2Ffind=Search</a>)
and finally the best one of all: The Open Directory Project (<a target=_top href="http://dmoz.org">http://dmoz.org</a>).<br>
These are of course all  
<font color=blue>possible</font> alternatives to the main search engines approaches.   <br><br>
Yet lists of links are and remain just  lists of links. Bound to decay into 
obsolescence. It is much better to describe the different APPROACHES, 
that will remain  valid for many many years even on our extremely 'quicksandish' web-environment. 
<bR>We have seen some of these approaches during our search for 
assembly books, let's quickly summarize them again:

wget, which  
<a target=_top href="http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/wget.htm">exists for windows as well</a>,  
 is a file retrieval tool that can be used via FTP or via HTTP  (the two most widely used Internet protocols). 
Used mostly in order to mirror websites, it can also be used to find files across the web. 
Wget supports proxy servers, and most of the features are configurable. An invaluable tool for searchers.

<font color=blue size=+4>Two assignments, one easy, one not.</font></center><br>
		<font size=+2>1)</font> For the "lazy occasional searcher" a simple and easy assignment:
(just in order to practices the various techniques explained above):  find <i><font color=blue>Python 2.1 Bible</fonT></i>, by Dave Brueck & Stephen Tanner, 
(Wiley, ISBN: 0764548077, 2001). 
Be careful: around the web there are few "unencrypted" pdf editions and many "encrypted" pdf editions. Obviously 
you  want to copy, use, extract whatever you fancy. 
So find the   "unencrypted" edition of this target. 
This search should take you at most 10 minutes.

<bR><bR>
	<font size=+2>2)</font>
For the "serious seeker warrior" a more complex assignment: Find data to stalk and highlight 
the wrongdoings of <a target=_top href="http://www.scl.cc/article.php?id=31">these dangerous clowns</a>... 
<IMG SRC="images/bulletr.gif" ALT="red" align="bottom" valign="bottom" WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="13">&nbsp;
<br>
You can see how naïvely direct they can -and do- propose to 
sell disinformation services for dictators & dictatorships  to be used 
against democratic media and against citizens at large.<br> 
As usual there's no shortage of scumbags, ready to sell their informatics skills to governments, military establishments 
or private buyers for whatever 
dirty and undemocratic use or purpose.<br>
There's instead, alas, a shortage of reversers that would care countering and denouncing this.  
<br>
Using google AND especially 
using some of the alternative approaches you have seen today,
 this search/stalking exercise can be accomplished in less than one week.
<br><bR>
    And now I'm finished. 
    <bR>Thank-you for your patience. Any questions?
