           <i>Well, searchers are surely  able to check/find/use
any available law,
          even without a specific page.<br>Yet some of the tools
and masks presented here may help many
           'local root organisation' (the so called 'civil
society'), which  most frequently do NOT have the
           privilege of counting capable seekers among their
members, in order to <font color=blue>find quickly and effectively
           their path in the juristic maze</font>, knowing
'against which laws' and 'trough which laws' they will have to
battle
           their way to a better world.<br>    
           <br>As anyone knows, human <font color=blue>"laws" are
often enough just a joke</font>, and their eventual implementation
           depends on  a combination of political will, the right
relation of force
           and the existence of a truly independent magistrature,
conditions that are often amiss in
           our two-tiers world of slaves whose ony task is to
consume, dominated by prepotent oligarchies of commercial
interests sanctified by
           paid media-propagandists and  corrupt political
lackeys.
           <br> <br>
           But laws DO exist, and can at times (especially if
rooted on older traditions and
           gentler society models) even annoy today's
slavemasters, who would rather prefer to keep
           laws (and laws perusing capabilities) hidden in clouds
of boredom, accessible only to the most resolved individuals,
            reserving the hunting grounds to the 'specialists'  of
the sector: lawyers and judges
           that knows
           very well where their career possibilities lie, where
their monetary perspectives thrive
           and, insomma, when to act and when to shut up. 
           <br><br>
           We will use, as an example, some  searches for <font
color=blue>laws relating to noise levels</font>.  This should
allow readers
           to learn the first "basic elements"    of internet law
searching.
                <br><br>
                There are various <font color=blue>other seeking
aspects</font>, that we will address soon or later: <b>1.</b> how
to find a lawyer or  an affordable attorney
                that can handle your legal need
                and/or
                help you with your legal issues, <b>2.</b> how to
                find 'legal forms' (in order to avoid as far as
possible lawyers' and attorneys' costs :-)
               
                        <b>3.</b> how to
                find sofwtare tools, if possible GNU-free, that
will handle your legal need
                and/or
                help you with your legal issues, given the fact
that software may (already and surely will, duh) be MUCH better
than lawyers and attorneys
                in digging out useful jurisprudence for your cases
:-) <br>We begin with the 'meat': where/how o find the TEXTS of
                the laws you may want to use/misuse.
                <br><br>
                Of course, as always, this section will florish if
and only if you yourself will contribute. <font color=blue>Do ut
des, duh</font>.

Although HotBot's paid results on SERPs, HotBot has rich (and sometimes unique:) filters which let you get ride of most commercial crap.

The pages we are trying to find have <font color=blue>a hard edge</font>: they <u>must</u> have a 
box where you can put your search query. In HTML language this means that the page 
must have a form <font color=blue>and HotBot is the only search engine that lets you search

            <br><hr width=50%><br>
     I just read fravia's "Searching laws on the wide web" essay
[http://www.searchlores.org/laws.htm] and I could not grasp the
fact that this is actually advanced searching.
<br>
<br>let me explain.
<br>
<br>
<br>Facts of law
<br>
<br>Laws are country/union specific
<br>Laws are created by official instances/gouvernements
<br>Laws need to be made public for them to be official
<br>Laws need to be studied
<br>
<br>Other facts
<br>
<br>People pay taxes

<br>Students have no money
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>The first approach should thus be:
<br>
<br>Find the official website of the instance responsible for the
judicional system of a country you wich to find a law from.
<br>Since all occupents of that country need to be informed about
the laws they should obey, chances are very large that some sort
of 'law database' is created with the taxpayers money.
<br>
<br>----------
<br>example:
<br>
<br>note:
<br>
<br>you'll need to develop your language skills since laws are
generally only published in the official languages of that
country.
<br>english isn't a very 'official' language outside the US and
UK.
<br>

<br>Belgium -&gt; www.belgium.be -&gt; offici�le belgische sites
-&gt; rechterlijke macht -&gt; www.juridat.be (JURIstic DATabese)
and bingo&#33;
<br>all belgian law on a pile with fulltext search ;-)
<br>----------
<br>
<br>OK, what if you live in a underdevelopped (gouvernement not
online) or crooked (gouvernement online but no law database
created with your tax payments)
<br>
<br>Somebody in your country must be studing law at some (un)known
lawschool(s). Education facilities were amongst the first
occupants of the internet (and have the one fact in common with
official websites : no ads or commercial junk to lead you of your
path)
<br>

<br>what are the chances that
<br>
<br>not one student of the law department has his website
dedicated to law or law resources?
<br>the school has absolutly no law resources at all online?
<br>
<br>I guess none? do you agree?
<br>
<br>Finding the databases concerning your/a countries law isn't
that hard you just need to brush up on your database accessing
techniques.
<br>
<br>Personally, advanced searching is finding something hard to
find, not finding something available aplenty. just my 2 (euro)
cents
<br>

It is possible that database of Russian and Chinese laws are
already online, and even free for anybody to access, but I bet
they are in their national tongue only, and using fonts that you
and me probably do not have on our machines, and even if we had
them... My Chinese is limited to names of restaurant dishes, while
my Russian is even more limited, therefore I, for one, could not
make anything of those sites even if I saw them, except maybe look
at the structures of links (Latin chars). There's a good reason
why countries would not typically translate their legislation in
other languages, and that's the humongous amount of texts in those
databases, increased daily, which would require the coordinated
efforts of an army of good translators. And then, there's no
incentive to do it. Anyway, the first place to look for national
legislation in the national tongue is the site of the country's
parliament, and alternatively the government's site.
<br>
<br>One may find English selections of national legislations on
various topics in other places, and not necessarily for free. If
you are interested in a specific subject-matter of, say, Chinese
legislation, I suggest you search that topic in English and you
may have a chance to find something. There are for instance
organizations interested in human rights, environment, gender
studies etc., or else consulting or financial companies interested
in financial or other matters, that do publish translations of the
acts that are relevant for their purpose. That's why I'm pretty
sure that one can easily find an English copy of the Russian
company tax law, or of the banking law (let's say on the site of
Russia's central bank - not checked, but it's likely), but much
less so that you will be able to find a specific Government Decree
regarding funds allocated to some obscure field of research.
<br>
<br>Another interesting case is that of countries with several
official languages, where the law usually states that everything
is to be published in all of these. That's the case of Canada for
instance, and I know they used to have an excellent and free
database of legislation, in fr & en of course. It might be the
case for Switzerland (a European country not in the EU). I don't
think that it applies to China, unless someone in Hong Kong
thought of it for some good reason. Again, Brazil and Russia would
have no reason to publish their entire legislation in anything
else then their national language. Which leaves us with the
specific selections of legislation I mentioned above.
<br>
<br>Concerning EU law with higher power than national
legislations, for EU countries but also (technically) for acceding
countries, that's entirely true. Many people are not aware of
that, or at least not entirely, and governments are not always
keen to remind it. In fact, governments usually put the blame on
Brussels when a controversial law is issued, but want to take the
credit for themselves whenever a EU law happens to be welcomed by
the public. In both cases, in fact, they have no real choice once
a regulation or other act is passed by either the Commission or
the Council.

IMHO HotBot is the best search engine for this particular task.
<br>
<br>Although HotBot's paid results on SERPs, HotBot has a rich
(and sometimes unique:) filters which let you get ride of most
commercial crap.
<br>
<br>The pages we are trying to find have a hard edge: they
<b>must</b> have to have  a box where you can put your search
query. In HTML language this means that the  page <b>must</b> have
to have a form and HotBot is the only search engine that lets you
search for pages containning forms. The syntax is <font
color=green>feature:form</font>.

<br>
<br>HotBot has other powerful advanced filters which lets you
pinpoint precisely what you want, among them: domain search,
region search, language search, words to include and words to
exclude.
<br>
<br>I'll show you some exemples of how to use it. Lets search for
resources on portuguese laws. In order to do that you can use the
following queries on HotBot:
<br>
<br><ul><li><a

<br>Filters used:
<br>
<br><ul><li><b>Language:</b> Portuguese<li><b>Domain:</b> pt
<li><b>Region:</b> Europe<li><b>Any of the Words, Anywhere in the
Page:</b> lei leis (law laws in portuguese)<li><b>None of the
Words, Anywhere in the Page:</b> murphy Kirchhoff (some false
positives)</ul>

<br>
<br>In your case change the fields <b>Language:</b>,
<b>Domain:</b>, <b>Region:</b> and  <b>Any of the Words, Anywhere
in the Page:</b> to the ones that better  describe your needs.
<br>
<br>Infortunatly HotBot let's you use 'Any of the Words, Anywhere
in the Page' only once, that why I have to search for 'search',
'procurar', 'procure', 'pesquisar' and  'pesquisa' (these words
are semantic sinonyms of 'search' in portuguese) in separated
queries.
<br>
<br>Here are some pointers to portuguese laws:
<br>

<br><blockquote><a
href="http://cr3.cea.ucp.pt/lei/lista.html">http://cr3.cea.ucp.pt/
lei/lista.html</a>
<br><a
href="http://cr3.cea.ucp.pt/leiciv/lista.html">http://cr3.cea.ucp.
pt/leiciv/lista.html</a>
<br><a
href="http://www.oa.pt/">http://www.oa.pt/</a></blockquote>If you
want a more specific subject ask it&#33; Lets say you want some
information about <font color=blue>laws relating to noise
levels</font>, all you have to do is replacing 'search' by 'ruido'
(noise in portuguese):
<br>
<br><a

Hehe, and I just tried:
<br>http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=utf-8&q=lei
+ru%C3%ADdo+site%3Agov.br&btnG=Google+Search

<br>
<br>Btw Google didn't recognize the accented i .. maybe this one
is better:
<br>http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=utf-8&q=lei
+site%3Agov.br+%28ruido+OR+ruidos+OR+ru%C3%ADdo+OR+ru%C3%ADdos%29&
btnG=Google+Search
<br>
<br>You rock&#33; :)
<br>Btw, why do you use feature:form with your keywords (+ruido
+feature:form)?
<br>"+pesquisa +feature:form" (or maybe "lei ambiental
feature:form") I can understand, but in that way you risk ending
up with "Fun portal: directory of best discoteques in Lisabon" or
something.

Nevertheless using the obvious names 'ruido' pays&#33; Btw I
forgot to point out that 'lei', 'leis' are still present in the
required keywords... so the query is still quite focused...
probably you wont find diskos so esely:)
