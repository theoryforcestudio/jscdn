    Slow connections are a nightmare when searching.<br> 



For a billion reasons you may want to check your connection to the web. Anonymity purposes, 
delay problems, suspicions about some site using dirty tricks, and even quick on the fly 
ways to resolve an alphabetical site name into an IP address.
<br>
I'll now explain you how you can do it WITHOUT special programs, simply using what 
your box already has inside it. I bet many readers did not know that you can 
do some of the following ON EVERY PC YOU HAPPEN TO SIT AT, at work, by friends, 
on your own, in a shop...<br>
The main problems you may encounter are lack 
of speed, unexpected disconnections, the impossibility to reach a web site even if you're 
damn sure it is there somewhere.<br> 
What's the reason for those problems? Who knows? Is it your own PC? Your phone line? Your ISP? Is the site 
you are trying to reach at fault? Any or all these factors may play a role: 
how do you narrow down the problem?
<br><bR>Since this is VITAL when searching, I'll now give you some hints. Note that 
there are tons of ad hoc software out there, à la netmedic (vitalsign), that 
has been made to help you locate the problem. But it is most of the time NOT necessary 
to use it. You have already all the necessary software inside your 
own PC. Good old dos box will work wonders: watch my hands.
<br><a name="fast"></a><hR>
<font color=blue><font size=+2>How fast is your connection to the web?</font></fonT><br>
<br>This is not easy to answer. Dial-up networking can give you the initial connection rate:
<br><font color=blue>right click on the DUN icon in system try and select status</fonT><bR>
but this is mostly incorrect. It displays the speed that applied when you FIRST connected to your 
ISP, while the actual transfer-speed can vary with time.<br> 

You may want to test on-line how quick your connection is <font color=blue>[</font>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.computingcentral.com/topics/bandwidth/speedtest50.asp">here</a>&nbsp;<font color=blue>]</font>.
<br>Yet to rely on third parties to check your speed is not the best solution.<bR>
Hence track the speed of your connection the whole time you are connected to your isp.
Enter system monitor. See accessories, system tools. If you don't find it there 
then open add/remove inside control panel and click on windows setup, 
then check system tools, and put ok inside the system monitor box.<br><br>
Once you run system monitors, you'll see a series of blank graphs. Remove all items, we 
want to start from scratch. Click on the top of the entries in the list, hold down shift and then click the bottom 
one, then OK: remove all.<br>Now select edit / add item. Look at all the interesting 
categories you can add and have a graph for.<br>
Click on the dial up adapter then hold down the ctrl key and choose 
bytes received/second & bytes transmitted/second & connection speed from the item column. Then 
click ok and finish.<br>
Setup is done, now connect to your isp, browse the web and look at the system monitor 
to see what is going on.<br>Note that the bytes received/second is not very reliable for
 non-compressed files (zip will give you more accurate results).<br>
Now let's say you remark that your connection speed is much slower as it should be, as you 
probably suspected from the beginning.<br>
Let's see if we can find out the problem:clear everything again then add every ERROR in the 
dial up adapter category (crc, framing, overruns and so on). It is common  to have a couple of these errors showing on when searching, but if you have 
a lot more, that could be the explanation for your slow connection.<bR>
<b>Time out errors</b> mean that your ISP is not responding to your modem as quickly as it 
should. Call tech support and ask what's going on, or change isp.<bR>
    <b>Framing errors</b> indicate communication problems between your modem and the isp. Talk with them and get 
confirmation that you modem is supported.
<b>Other errors</b> will mostly indicate hardware problems, faulty modems, serial cables 
that are not correctly connected if you have an external modem. 
<br><a name="checki"></a><hr>
<font color=blue><font size=+2>Pinging around (checking your connection)</font></fonT><br>
<br>Now your browser is working, you're connected to the web and you have entered the URL 
you are searching for.<br>The browser tells you it cannot find that page, why?<br>
You may try to find out using <i>ping</i>. Like a submarine, you are going to 
ping a server in order to get its echo. To use ping you have to fire a 
dos box (good old dos never dies, eh?). So go start ~ programs ~ ms-dos prompt and open the little black box of wonders.<br>
<bR>ping altavista.com
<font color=blue><prE>
Pinging altavista.com [204.152.190.62] with 32 bytes of data:

Ping statistics for 204.152.190.62:
Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 4, Lost = 0 (0% loss),
Approximate round trip times in milli-seconds:
Minimum = 0ms, Maximum =  0ms, Average =  0ms  
</prE></font>ping  vweb9.phase-one.com.au<font color=blue><prE>
Pinging vweb9.phase-one.com.au [203.21.35.2] with 32 bytes of data:

Ping statistics for 203.21.35.2:
Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 4, Lost = 0 (0% loss),
Approximate round trip times in milli-seconds:
Minimum = 0ms, Maximum =  0ms, Average =  0ms
</prE></fonT>
Note also how quickly you can resolve a name address into its correct IP number
using this trick!         <br>
If you don't get any reply then just use the command<br>
ping -t www.altavista.com<br>instead, and ping continuously, until 
you kill the dos box or nuke the command with Ctrl+C.<br>If you get a reply it 
will look like the following:<font color=blue><pre> insert here
</prE> </fonT>                                
  Use ping to check your own setup as well. Let's say you cannot connect to 
your isp. Then try the command<bR>ping 127.0.0.1<br> which is the 'basement' address, a loopback 
to your own pc. Note that you don't need to be on line to do this.
<font color=blue><pre>
Pinging 127.0.0.1 with 32 bytes of data:

Reply from 127.0.0.1: bytes=32 time<10ms TTL=128
Reply from 127.0.0.1: bytes=32 time<10ms TTL=128
Reply from 127.0.0.1: bytes=32 time<10ms TTL=128
Reply from 127.0.0.1: bytes=32 time<10ms TTL=128

Ping statistics for 127.0.0.1:
Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 4, Lost = 0 (0% loss),
Approximate round trip times in milli-seconds:
Minimum = 0ms, Maximum =  0ms, Average =  0ms</prE> </fonT>  
If this fail then your dial-up networking is not set up correctly. Reinstall TCP/IP, or, 
more simply, reinstall dial up networking completely.<br>
Even better, come to think of it: throw your windoze software out of 
your window and install linux instead, you'll never thank me enough for this advice :-) <br>
Back to pinging: once you ping like this<pre>
ping  searchlores.org</pre>
You'll either get an answer or not. If the server is up and running you'll get back a 
'Reply from' followed by a series of interesting numbers, if the server is down, or 
<u>traffic is too heavy</u> you'll get a 
'Request timed out' and/or a 'Destination net unreachable' message(s).

<br><a name="traci"></a><hr>
<font color=blue><font size=+2>Tracing web-delays</font></fonT><br>
<bR>Every time you select a URL or enter an http://   address in your browser, 
the code and graphic of the selected page has to pass through a lot of servers, 
more than a dozen most of the time, before they can get at your pc.<br>
Traceroute shows you WHERE some delays are happening, how many servers it takes to reach the target site and  so on.
Basically it is just a more powerful ping, and it works in a similar way.<br>
Once more the magical dos box.<br>
Type<br>tracert vweb9.phase-one.com.au<br>    and study the following:
<font color=blue><pre> insert here
</prE> </fonT>               
As you can see, you get a list of every internet server between you and the site you have specified.
Get to know your neighbours!
  

<br><a name="dead"></a><hR>
<font color=blue><font size=+2>Dead connections and IP-addresses</font></fonT><br>
<br>      
 We use memorable domain names for web sites, such as <font color=blue>[</font>"<a href="http://www.searchlores.org">searchlores.org</a>"<font color=blue>]</font> 
but the Internet, as you (should) know uses numeric IP addresses to identify servers (203.26.36.13 for 
searchlores.org). Special computers called DNS (Domain Name System) servers translate between the two.<br>
It is not only web sites that have IP addresses. When you connect to the web your own ISP allocates one to 
you too (in most cases a different one each time: dynamic IP).<br>
When you browse this does not matter much, some internet applications like internet telephones, 
chat programs and on line games) use IP addresses 
to connect directly to your PC.<bR>If you need to give your IP address to someone, just run 
the program winipcfg.exe that you will 
find in your <font color=blue>[</font><a href="file://localhost/c:/windows/">c:\windows</a><font color=blue>]</font> directory, while  
you are on line. This IP configuration utility <font color=blue>WinIPcfg.exe</font> comes
 also handy to diagnose dead connections to the web. Try running it if it looks like you are connected to your ISP 
but no internet application seems to work. An IP address of 0.0.0.0 and/or a blank "Default Gateway" box (The fourth 
box after "Adapter Address", "IP Address" and "Subnet Mask" from the main window 
of WinIPcfg.exe) mean that you are not connected correctly. That could be 
an ISP problem, or maybe your Dial-Up networking 
is faulty.<hr width=44%>
You will be able to find more info about IP addresses (and 
IP-addresses "confusion") in <font color=blue>[</font><a href="obscure.htm">obscure.htm</a><font color=blue>]</font>.

<b>How to disable Cyber Patrol</b>:<br>
Download a program called CPCrack
<a href = "http://www.peacefire.org/download/cpcrack.exe">here</a>.  
If you run this
program on a machine with Cyber Patrol installed, it will
display the Cyber Patrol headquarters password on your screen.
(Please note that CPCrack will not work with versions of Cyber
Patrol downloaded after November 1998; at that point, Cyber Patrol
changed the encryption scheme for their passwords so that CPCrack
would no longer work with their program.  We are working on a
version that also works with the newer version of Cyber Patrol.) 
<bR>Once you have obtained the password, log in to Cyber Patrol by
clicking on the Cyber Patrol icon on the taskbar, and entering
your password for the HQ password.  With Cyber Patrol open, go
to <b>File</b> and pick <b>Deputy Bypass</b>.  The Cyber Patrol
icon on the taskbar will now be marked with a red X to indicate
that Cyber Patrol has been disabled.  To re-enable
Cyber Patrol, go to
<b>File</b> and select <b>Deputy Bypass</b> again (which should
now have a check mark next to it) to turn off the bypass.
<bR>If you're interested in how the Cyber Patrol password cracker works,
you can read
Bennett's <a href = "cpcra2.htm">explanation</a> of
how Cyber Patrol encrypts the master password, and how CPCrack reverses
the decryption to recover it.

<b>How to disable SurfWatch</b>:<br>
<ul>

<li>	Remove the shortcuts to "SurfWatch" (and possibly
"SurfWatch Updater") from the StartUp folder.  </li>
<li>	Open the win.ini file and replace the line<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>load= C:\CO_RO_NT\surfctl.exe</b><br>
with just<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>load=</b><br> </li>
<li>	Run regedit.exe to edit the Windows 95 Registry and
delete the key "GraphicsFilter", which is a subkey of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServices\</b><br>
The value of this key will be "C:\CO_RO_NT\surfctl.exe".  Delete it before
continuing.</li>
<li>	Restart the computer in DOS mode.  Move to the
c:\windows\system\ directory and type:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>attrib -h -r -s system.drv</b><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>move system.drv system.bak</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>move net.drv system.drv</b><br></lI>
<li>	Type "win" to start Windows again.  If it tells you
"Windows is still running one or more MS-DOS based programs..."
try typing "exit".
       </li></uL>


SurfWatch will now be disabled on your computer.  Reverse all
of the steps above to re-enable it.</lI> 
<br>

<lI> <b>How to disable Net Nanny</b>:<br><bR>
     To disable Net Nanny <b>temporarily</b>:

<br><br>

Press CTRL, ALT, and DELETE simultaneously, bringing up the task manager
Highlight "Wnldr32" and click 'End Task'.

<br><br>

This will kill Net Nanny until the next time you restart your computer.
After you restart your computer or restart Windows, Net Nanny will be
running again.

<br><br>

To disable Net Nanny <b>permanently:</b>

<br><br>

Open the file c:\windows\system.ini.  Under the section marked
"[boot]", there should be a line labelled "drivers=" with some stuff
listed after it.  Remove the word "wndrv16.dll" from the "drivers="
line.  (If there are other words listed on the "drivers=" line,
leave them there, just remove "wndrv16.dll".)  Save changes to the
file and restart your computer.
<br><br>
After you restart your computer, Net Nanny should be permanently gone.

<font color=blue><font size=+2>Windoze '95 halves Your Download Speed</font>
</fonT><br>
<br>Did you know that Windoze '95 <b>halves Your Download Speed</b>?<br><br>
If you access the Internet primarily
by dial-up connection, Win95 may
be holding you back... way back!<br>
That's because, by default, Win95
optimizes some of its internal
Internet settings for LANs, and not
for modems. For example, Win95 normally sets an MTU
(Maximum Transmission Unit) packet size of 1500, an
Ethernet standard. But standard dial-up Internet
connections use a packet size of 576 bytes. The
packet-size mismatch can lead to needless slowdowns. If
you use your company's Ethernet LAN, leave MTU and
its related settings alone. But if you access via modem,
grab a free copy of Mike Sutherland's MTU-Speed applet
at <font color=blue>[</font>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mjs.u-net.com/mtuspeed/mtuspeed.htm">http://www.mjs.u-net.com/mtuspeed/mtuspeed.htm</a>&nbsp;<font color=blue>]</font><br>
This nifty little utility lets you easily adjust MTU and
various other Registry settings that can affect dial-up
speed. Some users report their download speeds have
doubled after using the optimizations suggested by
MTU-Speed!<br><br>
Of course this kind of solution leave you still with a slow and buggy operating system... 
the real correct solution is <b>to cross over to Linux!</b>. And I don't know of anybody that 
went back to Windoze after having tried Linux...
