Good day (morning or evening) Fravia+ 
   <br>
I have some information that I think might be of some
interest to you since it involves commercial websites
and payment processing. 
 <br>     <br>
First of all I do not pretend to be a hot-shot hacker
and you will not find me roaming the net under some
cool name like <font color=blue>v33zRd</font> or whatever else. I am just a
developer who worked with web based stuff from quite
some time. I nether got up one morning and decided to
become a hacker, nor have I planned this for years. It
just happened that I was assigned by my employers to
some projects that involved security and coding for
load test. Well enough about me lets get to the meat
of the matter. 
   <br>   <br>
In one of my recent  projects I had to build a payment
processor integration for an eCommerce website. A
decision was made to try out the GeoTrust. GeoTrust
provides SSL certificates for websites and also
resales credit card transactions from SkipJack for the
commercial web. An astonishing discovery GeoTrust
encourages its clients to bounce the credit card
transaction from the buyers browser! Unbelievable
stupid way of clearing a credit card. This opens the
door for anyone with half way programming skill to
compromise the response and order products and
services from the merchant without actually paying for
it. 
     <br><br>
Of cause I have notified GeoTrust about it but they
have buried their head in the sand on this issue. In fact
they do not consider it an issue. I wonder why? It is
either due to the fact that they do not want to admit
to such as stupidity or due to the fact that they do
not want to refund the money for the Quick Payments
account closed by the merchant once I informed the
merchant that the buyer's machine would be the last
link in the credit card transaction chain. 
        <br><br>
As many corporate swines GeoTrust has really pathetic
support and rather poor understanding or web
technology. Just the fact that they are using
Microsoft ASP (Active Server Pages) speaks of it. But
I will not go in to arguments of what technology is
superior or inferior. That is not the point. <br>The point
is that <font color=blue>some so called developers at this organization
are so damn blind that they literally can not see
beyond their noses</font>. Here is how it works:
      <br><br>
A transaction is initiated from the server side by the
merchant and sent to GeoTrust server over secure HTTPS
connection for validation. The transaction contains a
list of parameters and values and acts as an HTTP
post. Here is the example of the string being passed
to the gateway server: 
        <br><br>
(I replaced the serial numbers with Xs and domain name
is changed)
<pre>
szSerialNumber=XXXXXXXXX&amp;
szDeveloperSerialNumber=XXXXXXXXXX&amp;
szOrderNumber=777&amp;
szDesiredStatus=AUTHORIZE&amp;
szAmount=1.45&amp;
szTransactionId=&amp;
szForceSettlement=0&amp;
serialnumber=XXXXXXXXXXX&amp;
orderstring=1%7E1%7E1.45%7E1%7EN%7E%7C%7C&amp;
ordernumber=2&amp;
sjname=Test+Dude&amp;email=null40Ssomewebsite.com&amp;
streetaddress=8320&amp;streetaddress2=&amp;
city=Some+City&amp;
state=FL&amp;
zipcode=85284&amp;
transactionamount=1.45&amp;
accountnumber=4445999922225&amp;
month=09&amp;
year=05&amp;
shiptoname=Test+Dude&amp;
shiptostreetaddress=8320&amp;
shiptostreetaddress2=8320&amp;
shiptocity=85284&amp;
shiptostate=FL&amp;
shiptozipcode=85284&amp;
shiptophone=8005551212&amp;

Simple thing and simple to achieve. Here is a JSP
example of how this can be posted:
     <br><br>
1)      // Define and connect to quickpayments URL <br>
2)      URL u = new URL("<a href="https://developer.quickpayments.com/scripts/evolvcc.dll?Authorize" target=_blank>https://developer.quickpayments.com/scripts/evolvcc.dll?Authorize</a>");
<br>3)      URLConnection uc = u.openConnection();  <br>
4)      uc.setDoOutput(true);<br>
5)      uc.setDoInput(true);<br>
6)     
uc.setRequestProperty("Content-Type","application/x-www-form-urlencoded"); <br>
7) 	  // POST the data <br>
8)      DataOutputStream output = new
DataOutputStream(  <br>
9)      uc.getOutputStream() );  <br>
10)  <br>
11)     // post the query string <br>
12)     // to the server and get the response <br>
13)     output.writeBytes( str.toString() ); <br>
14)     output.close();<br><br>
The query string is the string above. So far so good,
server side and secure, but now we have to get a
response from quickpayments connection: <br>

15) 		// get the response <br>
16) 	BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(  <br>
17) 	new InputStreamReader(    <br>
18) 	uc.getInputStream()) );  <br>
19) 	tags = in.readLine();   <br>
20)   in.close(); <br><br>

and it comes something like this: <br><br>

NOTE:  <br>
I have replaced the &lt; with [ and &gt; with ] since this
mailer acts weird when an HTML snippet is used in the
email.

When I saw that at first I was wondering whether what
I was seeing is really true. Look for yourself. This is
nothing less then a complete simple HTML page with a
form filled with all the values meant to be posted
back to my server via onLoad java script. From
where(?) you might ask. <font color=blue>From the buyer's browser</font>!
               <br><br>
I was not too happy with that and at first I was
convinced that I am just delusional and that this is
not meant to be posted to the user browser. But if so
I would have to parse this garbage. <br>So I have
contacted support at GeoTrust. It was not an easy task
to get some one to talk to. My questions were: Can I
get a response from your transaction server that I can
parse and make the decision to mark the order as paid
or unpaid before displaying my own response page to
the user? <font color=blue>Why do you post my serial numbers in the
transaction that returns back to me</font>? The first four
emails were answered “I do not understand you
question”. But after few futile attempts some bozo
from second level support answered the following:
                   <br><br>
“GeoTrust provides easiest integration... (blah blah
blah) ... the data sent from our server should be
printed in to the user browser and the  javascript
would redirect the client browser back to your server,
so you can have your response page be in any language
you desire...”
           <br><br>
Excuse me?   <br>
Did I read that correctly? You want me to have the
credit card transaction response to bounce off the
buyer's browser? You want me to rely on what the
buyers machine has to say about the validity of the
credit card? 
          <br><br>
Turns out that this is in fact what they mean. 
                                 <br><br>
I am not a hacker but I can write my own browser using
APIs available and change the [input type="hidden"
name="szIsApproved" value="0"] to [input type="hidden"
name="szIsApproved" value="1"] and post that instead.
Simply use apache web browser API and HTMLUNIT code
both are available on the net and really easy to use.
<br><br>
Build a simple class that would walk the website and
gather the goods in to the shopping cart then process
the information and make sure that you parse the
responses for the hidden tag mentioned above. Now replace
the value from 0 to 1 and you would get all kind of free stuff!
          <br><br>
I asked the senior level integration engineer why they
not use XML and the response was “XML does not support
tag/value pairs”. Ok this tells me that this
particular engineer does not know a thing about XML.
May be his boss should buy her a book. Only he would probably 
understand even less himself. 
           <br><br>
GeoTrust does not see this as security hole and
refuses to admit to it's own stupidity. But I know,
that if I can enter so easily, anyone can, and no cookies or
javascritps would save you. The simple command lane
browser can be build from the available APIs. It would
present itself as any browser you want and will
keep the session going and everything else that a
browser does. It would take about a day and a half
to write and debug. The pages coming from the merchant
server are set in to HTMLPage object and all the data
can be accessed and changed on the fly. I have done
that for unit test of HTML on my previous jobs and I
could do that again, only this time in order to get some free stuff. If
I can do that – anyone can.<br><br>

I hope that, publishing this @ <a href="http://www.searchlores.org">searchlores</a>, those "GeoTrust" (nomen est omen) clowns will finally take notice 
of their serious security holes: Lee tried more than once to alarm them, but 
 to no avail.   </i>

                Just a little note to point out that you could also do this stuff 
with <a href="proxy.htm">proxomitron (etc)</a> instead of writing your own custom browser. 

(<a href="http://www.searchlores.org/zipped/ProxN44.zip">proxo</a> changes your browser into a custom browser hehe :)

You don't need proxomitron for  this endeavour (most recent versions of javascript allows DOM 2 access;=) see for instance what bookmarklets can do with <a target=_top href="http://www.squarefree.com/bookmarklets/forms.html">forms</a>... see in particular <a target=_top href="http://www.squarefree.com/bookmarklets/forms.html#show_hiddens">show hiddens</a> bookmarklet...
