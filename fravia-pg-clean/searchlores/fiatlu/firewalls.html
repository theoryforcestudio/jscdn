Simply put, a firewall is a system designed to prevent unauthorized access to or from a private network  Firewalls can be implemented in bothhardware and software, or a combination of both. Firewalls are frequently used to prevent unauthorized Internet users from accessing private networks connected to the Internet.  All messages entering or leaving the computer system pass through the firewall, which examines each message and blocks those that do not meet the specified security criteria. 
Today, firewall soft for PC is a MUST. Every time you access a web site, download a file or juts log online you unwittingly give ton of info 
about yoursef, your system where you have been before ets. Web sites try feeding us cookies, or slip running unwanted java scripts. Worse, script kiddies like to scan ports or probe our PCs while we are using ICQ or IRCs.

  <P> There are several types of firewall techniques: 
<LI><B>Packet filter:</B> Looks at each packetentering or leaving the network and accepts or rejects it based on user-defined rules. Packet filtering is fairly effective and transparent to users, but it is difficult to configure. In addition, it is susceptible to IP spoofing. <LI><B>Application gateway:</B> Applies security mechanisms to specific applications, such as  and Telnet servers. This is very effective, but can impose a performance degradation. 
<LI><B>Circuit-level gateway:</B> Applies security mechanisms when a TCP</A> or UDP connection is established. Once the connection has been made, packets can flow between the hosts without further checking. 
<LI><B>Proxy server:</B> Intercepts all messages entering and leaving the network. The proxy server effectively hides the true network addresses.  <P> In practice, many firewalls use two or more of these techniques in concert. </P> 
A firewall is considered a first line of defense in protecting private information.

Review  of available firewalls for PCs</FONT></H3></CENTER>

Here are several firewall products:<BR>
<BR>
The Firewall from <A HREF="http://www.signal9.com">Signal9</A> is a new software package allowing you to define exactly what communication is allowed to enter and leave your PC. In this way you can filter ICMP packets so you will be immune to the DoS attack that disconnects you from IRC. The Firewall works on a ruleset that is available for you to download here. This ruleset has been built and tested with all of the programs you see on the list below, and it will have minimal impact on your existing Internet activity. Below is the list of applications that have been tested with the Firewall, and conflicts, if any.In the end, extremly well done firewall product but hard to sue because it stops and ask you if you want to allow ALL outgoing and incoming packetges, plus the documentatiion on it is spotty and not complete. Only for the trully paranoid people.<BR>

<font color=red>Proximotron </FONT>from< A HREF=http://www.e>.....</A>
Conclusion: GET IT and get it NOW!

<font color=red>At Guard </FONT>from <A HREF=HTTP://www.atguard.com>AtGuard.com</A>Advantiges: very effective product, but  it cost a bit of money

<font color=red>Guard Dog </FONT>from <A HREF=HTTP://www.atguard.com> nnnnn</A>bla bla
Conclusion: Complelty useless piece of crap, you have been had, delete it off your system.
<font color=red>Lockedown</FONT>from <A HREF=HTTP://www.atguard.com>nnnn
</A>Conclusions the worse of the lot, boy, are you a sucker!
