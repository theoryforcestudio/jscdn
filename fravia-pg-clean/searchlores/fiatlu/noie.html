<CENTER><H2>Why you shouldn't use Internet Explorer</H2></CENTER>
<BR>
Today, Win98 comes with Internet Explorer 5 bundled in. Statistics tell
us over 60% of people on the 'net use some form of IE over 40% of Netscape. (We are going to be introduced to Win 2000 soon, which I suspect will be even worse, but let's go back to IE). Here i will TRY to tell you WHY its not a good idea to use IE and that you are MUCH better off using Netscape (as in one of the lesser evils).<BR>
<BR> 

1. First of all, IE is made by Micro$oft. This fact by itself should be enough to scare you into NEVER EVER using IE again, but if NOT, then please read on...<BR>
<BR>

2. Second, IE is embedded so deep inside Windoze, it will take a blow torch to pry it out and you STILL will never succeed fully. Ol' Bill made sure IE is an essential part of Windoze that it used cross referencing  the most  importiant Windoze files. You will find IE records data of your activities into the following folders(and this is NOT a complete list): 
<LI><FONT COLOR=red>C:\Windows\History</FONT>, <BR>
<LI><FONT COLOR=red>C:\Windows\Temporary Internet Files</FONT><BR>
<LI><FONT COLOR=red>C:\Windows\Temporary Internet Files\Cache</FONT><BR>
<LI><FONT COLOR=red>C:\Windows\Cookies</FONT><BR>
<LI><FONT COLOR=red>C:\Windows\Web</FONT> that contains a file named
ftp htt which when looked at with an HeX editor said proudly on top: This file generated authomatically by internet Explorer <BR>
<BR>

Microsoft's IE also maintains a minimum of 12 user activity databases. These files are known as either 
<FONT COLOR=red>MM256.DAT</FONT>, 
<FONT COLOR=red>MM2048.DAT</FONT> and 
<FONT COLOR=red>Index.dat</FONT COLOR=YELLOW> files. One of each is kept in ALL of the above listed folders- the History, cookies (hidden completely), and in each of your four cache folders (also hidden). The cookies and cache folders are not the only records MSIE keeps on your internet activities. Additionally, if you use MSIE's <FONT COLOR=red>mail</FONT COLOR=YELLOW> and <FONT COLOR=red>news</FONT COLOR=YELLOW>, everything you read and see is also  recorded in other databases within MSIE. A good deal of information is also stored in the registry where your file system cannot get at it. So you will have to think about and cleaning all that information, including the databases and the  information in the registry.

3. Third, when I tried cleaning All those folders and files I ran into problems. <FONT COLOR=red>C:\Windows\History</FONT COLOR=YELLOW> folder. No luck. No matter what i did it STILL had ALL the URL in "today" file.<BR>
<BR>
Yes, <FONT COLOR=red>Windows Washer</FONT COLOR=YELLOW>
 WAS supposed to have cleaned ALL those files and folders. Unfrotunatly, it didnt. I ran <FONT COLOR=red>Dir Snoop</FONT COLOR=YELLOW> aftr it and looked at <FONT COLOR=red>C:\Windows\History</FONT COLOR=YELLOW>, and 
To my surprise, all the info was STLL there I ran Windwos Washer again, with the SAME exact results.<BR>
<BR>
 to get rid of   index.dat that IE creates. I have IE set to use a different drive partition (137MB) for  cache folder and then I just format it and BCWipe it every night. 

Remember that the most problematic aspect of IE cache is that it 
is resident inside IE global memory space and available for download and 
retention by any  site that you visit so maybe you should  set the timer on window washer and to  wipe the cache at regular intervals<BR>
 
If you Do NOT believe me, then run the same tests I did and compare the results. I HOPE THAT will change your mind. No, Netscae is NOT uch better, but at least its lesser than 2 evils, so I would choose it ANYDAY over IE.
