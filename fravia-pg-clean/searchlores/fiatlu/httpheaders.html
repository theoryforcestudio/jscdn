your web browser and ALL the sites you visit. Known as HTTP header messages

 to ANY web site without even being asked. As you will see, some of this 
info you might rather keep to yourself. Some soft like The Proxomitron will
not only lets you view all those messages, but also lets you alter, add, or
 delete them. If security is important to you, make it your business to 
know what your browser is telling the world and have it say only what you 
want!
 The order of the varibles will vary from server to server. 
Of course, Java, Java Script, Active X will gather a lot more info off your 
PC incuding but not limited to IP number, Email addresses, they can look at 
what files you have on your PC, run exes without your permittion, ets<BR>
