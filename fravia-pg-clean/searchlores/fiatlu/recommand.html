Windows cleaning  Tips </H2></center>

<CENTER><H3><font color=red>while "surfing" online</font></H3></CENTER>

1. Make yor browsers refuse  ALL <font color=red>Cookies</font>, 
turn off ALL <font color=red>Java</font>, <font color=red>Java Script</font>,
  <font color=red> ActiveX</font>, <font color=red> Auto 
Install</FONT> on your browsers.  
<BR><BR>

2. ALWAYS USE a <font color=red> PROXY </FONT> while surfing 
for added privacy and protection from snoopers, ad men, ets! For a list 
of proxies go to <A HREF="proxy.html">proxies 
info</A>. When using a proxy, check to see if your proxy is secure: 
<A HREF=http://check.html>proxy checkers</A>  (Start Button/Run/winipcfg to
see your IP).  or here:
<A HREF=http://www.helie.com/BrowserCheck/>helie.com/BrowserCheck</A>If 
you DO NOT know anything about Proxies, read the <A HREF="proxy.html">what's 
a proxy FAQ</A>, then go to<A HREF="https://searchlores.nickifaulk.com/fiatlu/setProxy.html"> how to set your browser 
to use a proxy FAQ </A>,and check the <A HREF="check.html"> proxy page</A>
<BR><BR>

3. Always have a good <font color=red>intrusion detection system</FONT> 
running. In the Windoze world the current favorite would be 
<font color=red>BlackICE Defender</FONT>. 
It will block hacking atempts, and will filter all kinds of junk while you 
are on. 

<A HREF=http://www.clariondeveloper.com/> http://www.clariondeveloper.com</A>has the <font color=red>ClearIce </FONT> freeware which will 
assist you in analyzing the data that <font color=red>BlackICE </FONT>
produces. <BR>
<BR><BR>


4.   Your next step should be a <font color=red>FireWall</FONT>. 
Unfortunatly <font color=red>AtGuard </FONT> has been discontinued, 
but it has the best documentation on how to use it, and you can still 
find copies of it floating around. If you are really paranoid the best 
then will be
  <font color=red>Conseal PC Firewall - Signal 9</FONT>
 Conseal also blocks protocols the other products (currently) ignore. 
You will need to learn a little about ports and protocols but a liitle 
knowledge won't harm  you. Other good ones are 
<font color=red>Proxymitron</FONT>(totally free),  
from <A HREF=http://members.tripod.com/Proxomitron/> http://members.tripod.com/Proxomitron</A>
<BR><BR> 

5. You do NOT want to share ALL your files with everyone on the 'net, do 
you? Well, thats exactly what your silly Windoze allows by default, 
because it assumes that you are connected to shared local area network 
(LAN), so   it has <font color=red>file and printer sharing</FONT>
 option ON by default. It is port 139 which is the NETBIOS Session Service,
 its BOTH udp and tcp.

To disable it, go to 
<font color=red>Control Panel</FONT>+<font color=red>System</FONT >+<font color=red>Performance</FONT>+<font color=red>File System</FONT>+<font color=red>Trouble Shooting folder</FONT>, then choose <font color=red>
Disable new file system and locking semantics</FONT COLOR=red> bullet. The system will then ask you to restart your PC. Do so. You are done. <BR>
<BR>
Its a good idea to shut off  ALL the other ports you have open on your 
connection, 
Do not leave an ftp or telnet or http port open if you are not ACTUALLY 
USING IT. Generally a good firewall will take care of ALL your ports. 
The port numbers are divided into three ranges:
 well known ports 0-1023, registered ports 1024-49151, and dynamic ports 
49152-65535.      The well-known ports are used by your computer for the basic protocols. Numbers are typically "bound" to a specific protocol e.g. port 80 is for HTTP, port 443 is for HTTPS,   etc.
 he other ports are assigned dynamically by your computer as needed starting with port 1024. In other words, if you use a dial-up connection then your first connection to your ISP  will usually be on port 1024. Here is a link for some more information.
 <A HREF=http://www.chebucto.ns.ca/~rakerman/port-table.html>
ttp://www.chebucto.ns.ca/~rakerman/port-table.html</A>
 This page also links to other good  information.<BR>
<BR><BR>

6. <font color=red>DO NOT</FONT> d/l and run any .exe from an unknown 
sources! Thats the ONLY sure way to get viruses or trojans!
  After all, you'd NOT stick your penis in EVERY warm hole you 
meet, right?...well maybe YOU would...
<BR><BR>

Lets review: 1. set your browsers to refuse java, javaScript, cookies, ActiveX, 
2. use a proxy, and 3. use a firewall....<BR>
<BR><BR><BR>







<CENTER><H3><font color=red>after you are done "surfing"</font></H3></CENTER>
here is where the fun starts!..you will need to do some serious cleaning of 
your PC now, so lets get to it!<BR>
<BR>

1. Hope you know that while "surfing", EVERY image you looked at, every web
 page you looked at was saved on your HD in your Browser's cache(s). IE has 4
and netscape has 2. So you definetly wannna clean, wipe, 
empty the following folders/files that have been filled with all sorts of 
info about where you surfed and what you looked at:
<UL>
<LI> browser's<FONT COLOR=red> Caches</FONT> in BOTH <font color=red>
C:\Windows\Temporary Internet Files</FONT>, and your Browser's folders  
<LI>the browser's <FONT COLOR=red> History </FONT> folders that contain the 
URL of every place you visited, <font color=red>IE </FONT> has one 
inside <font color=red>C:\Windows\</FONT>, 
<font color=red>Netcape</FONT> inside it's folder. 
<LI>the <FONT COLOR=red>Cookies </FONT> 
Folders in both <font color=red>C:\WINDOWS</FONT COLOR=red> and<FONT 
COLOR=red> C:\Program FIles\Netscape\Users\Cookies</FONT>
 if you use Netscape </UL><BR>

You can clean all those folders either manually 
(very cumbersome and time consuming), or by using either 
<font color=red>Windows Washer</FONT> 
from<A HREF=http://www.webroot.com or>webroot.com</A> or Evidence 
Eliminator or <font color=red>Eraser </font> other good product. 
<BR>
<BR><BR>

2. clean all the <font color=red>KNOWN hidden files</FONT> in Windoze:<BR> 
<UL>
<LI><font color=red>Index.dat</FONT>
(formerly known as MM256 and MM2045) is hidden in:
C\WINDOWS\COOKIES\, C:\WINDOWS\Temporary Internet Files,
C:\WINDOWS\HISTORY\, C:\WINDOWS\Temporary Internet Files\<BR>
<LI><font color=red>mm256 & mm2048.dat</FONT>
can be found in:<BR>C:\WINDOWS\HISTORY,          
C:\WINDOWS\COOKIES ,       C:\WINDOWS\TEMPOR~1\CACHE1,       
C:\WINDOWS\TEMPOR~1\CACHE2, C:\WINDOWS\TEMPOR~1\CACHE3,      
C:\WINDOWS\TEMPOR~1\CACHE4<BR>
<LI><font color=red>desktop.ini</FONT>
C:\WINDOWS\Temporary Internet Files, 
C:\WINDOWS\HISTORY\,
C:\WINDOWS\HISTORY\History.IE5</UL><BR>

<BR>
<BR><BR>
 
3. NEVER, EVER  delete ANY files to the <font color=red>Trash Bin 
</FONT>because the files are NOT actually deleted, only their headers have
 been modified - marked to be written over. Any techy with a minimum 
knowledge, armed with Norton or some other utilities like <font color=red>DirSnoop</FONT> or <font color=red> Encase </FONT> will be able to find all those "deleted" files in less than 5 minutes  Oh, the shame of those ol' anal pix, eh? Get either<A HREF=http://www.jetico.scf.fi/> BCWipe </A> or  
<font color=red>Eraser </FONT> and and use them.
  Or you can instead, create a folder and make sure you wipe that folder with Eraser or 
create a virtual drive inside RAM and keep the stuff there. The drive will be gone once the PC is shut off.<BR>
 <BR><BR>

4. if you use <font color=red>ICQ</FONT> then you also need to clean your 
chats. The new <font color=red>ICQ99</FONT> keeps 2(!) separate records of all those chats. 
1. first you click on each user's name, go to <font color=red>History</FONT>,
 then <font color=red>View Messages History folder</FONT>. There choose the 
<font color=red>Delete all</FONT> button.<BR>2. second go to <font color=red>ICQ</FONT> logo (main menu) the one with the animated dog or 
cat or whatever it is, and choose the <font color=red>Messages Archive </FONT>Click on the <font color=red>Deleted Items</FONT>(twice), then <font color=red>Messages</FONT>. Choose all
the messages in the right Window with right mouse button+Shift.
Press your delete button on the keyboard. Repeat with <font color=red>Chats</FONT>,
<font color=red>Notes</FONT>. go to <font color=red>Messages next</FONT>(twice). clean all-message dialogs, 
<font color=red>Received</FONT>, go through all the names one by one. Repeat with all the 
rest. You are done.<BR>
<BR><BR>  

Think you are done yet?..hell, NO!...Before shutting down your PC for the day
 you should also clean:<BR>
<BR>


5. <font color=red>C:\WINDOWS\Recent</FONT>  has all the recent looked at 
at files. in <font color=red>NT</FONT> you can find it in 
<font color=red>C:\WINNT\PROFILES\ADMIN~1\RECENT\</FONT>  and 
<font color=red>C:\WINDOWS\QFNONL\RECENT\</FONT> . <font color=red>
Windows Washer</FONT>  and <font color=red>Evidence Eliminator</FONT>
 will take care of those folders by default.<BR> 
<BR><BR>

6. Win95, 98, UNIX, NT use a virtual memory space to keep files there called 
<font color=red>Swap file</FONT>. When a proccess becomes inactive its 
data is copied back into RAM, but the virtusl swap file is never overwriiten. Your data can stay there for days or even months!
Worse some systems liek NT and Win95 have swap fiels that grow and shrink in 
size  dinamically using the empty space on your HD. Thus wiping the file in a shrinken space can leave parts of it in whats now the unused free space.<BR>
<font color=red>Win 95</FONT> & <font color=red>98</FONT> swap file is
 inside <font color=red>C:\Windows</FONT> and is called 
<font color=red>Win386.swp</FONT>.
<font color=red>NT</FONT>'s swap file is called <font color=red>
pagefile.sys</FONT>.  
In <font color=red>UNIX</FONT> you can actually  switch to alternatice 
swap file (Cool, eh?) while erasing the original. Check 
<font color=red>/etc/fstab</FONT> for references to yuor swap partition.<BR> 

If you shut Windoze properly, the file will be gone, but according to some 
people the info can still be read off the HD. You CAN'T clean it while in 
Windoze, so you need to do it in D<font color=red>OS </FONT>mode.<BR> 
Supposedly using <font color=red>scorch</FONT>the program Dr Who talks 
about in <A HREF="https://searchlores.nickifaulk.com/fiatlu/crypfaq11.html">his FAQ</A> or using Windows Washer, or 
<font color=red>Evidence eliminator3.0</FONT> delete the file. I 
have used  With EnCase I found that it was the same as before. I would
 say to be safe use <font color=red> bcwipe </FONT> on the empty 
 space of your HD will clean any remains of that file.<BR>
<BR><BR>

7. DO NOT forget yo also wipe the <FONT COLOR=RED>Free Space</FONT> on your HD that 
Windows uses as a virtual memory space with 
<font color=red>BCWipe</FONT> from 
<A HREF=http://www.jetico.sci.fi/>jetico.sci.fi</A>or <font color=red>
Eraser</FONT COLOR=red>, 
BOTH of which are free. Read the <A HREF="https://searchlores.nickifaulk.com/fiatlu/toolzb.html">Useful toolz FAQ</A>
on where to find them and how to use them.
WARNING: some people report problems with it.They 
have had to reconfigure and re-load Win95 AFTER using BCWipe. So the 
program IS NOT for  everyone<BOLD> off-site</BOLD>There is also <font color=red>Shredder</FONT COLOR=red>.<BR>
<BR><BR>

8. Two VERY revealing files on your PC  are <font color=red>USER.DAT</FONT COLOR=red> and
<font color=red>SYSTEM.DAT</FONT COLOR=red> that
are make <font color=red>Windoze's  
Registery</FONT>. They are inside<font color=red>C:\Windows</FONT>.

 To look at them you must first make all your hidden and 
system files visible by clicking the right mouse button and 
choosing VEIW, OPTIONS, then VIEW foder again and click on the Show all files button.
The problem with them is since they are system files you can't clean
them and even if you did, Windoze will regenerate them right back
up with  exactly the same data  it had before.
It had been suggested to that one way to deal with this two files is to:
 Boot the system in DOS, and while in DOS, use REGEDIT 
to make a backup copy of <font color=red>USER.DAT
 </FONT COLOR=red>and <font color=red>SYSTEM.DAT</FONT COLOR=red> in a 
directory other than Windows. Now,rename the original 

USER.DAT and SYSTEM.DAT to anything else (such as .SAV)
 and copy the backup copies back into the Windows 
directory. This cleans up the registry something 
wonderful, and often results in much smaller -- and 
faster registry files. This only works in DOS; doing it
 in a DOS window   in Windows won't work.<BR>
<BR><BR>



9. <font color=red>Defrag</FONT COLOR=red> your HD weekly if not more
 often. that way all the info in the 
old clusters you had used will be wiped and cleaned . After defragging, 
run eitherBCWipe or Eraser and wipe the free disc space. One time run should
 be
 enough.<BR>
<BR><BR>

10. Win98 has an <font color=red>AppLog</FONT> in <font color=red>C:\WINDOWS\</FONT>
 contains a txt based log file for EACH application I have on my PC, with
 some weird numbers that dont make any sence to me. Go ahead check YOUR PC.
 Now WHY would Windoze keep a log like this? If anybody can tell me what 
those numbers mean, please, DO contact me.<BR>   
<BR><BR>

11. Get rid of the<font color=red>.tmp files</FONT>that are inside 
<font color=red>C:\Windows\Temp.</FONT>
Tempfiles are supposed to be deleted from your computer whenever you shut it
down. However, in certain situations (like when your computer crashes) temp
 files remain on the hard disk. When booting, the stupid OS will also save 
lost clusters as FILE0001.CHK, ets. Delete all those with Windows Washer or Evodence Eliminator.
Or you can do it all in DOs mode(not recommended becase we dont really know if DOS actually deletes
them or just marks the file headers as deleted): 1.Choose Start, Shut Down, Restart in MS-DOS mode.
  2.At the DOS prompt type: cd\windows\temp and press Enter.
      3.Type: del *.tmp to banish all temp files from the
          C:\Windows\Temp folder.
 <BR><BR>



12. Get an email program that uses TEXT. (good one is thebat with the NO HTML 
switch) But pegasus and others work well too. And I find people are touchy
 about this subject. pegasus + PGP is cool and it can use more than one 
mailer is NEAT-O. and can  confuse those that study headers. 
TheBat is good too If you need to be stealth you can use some bouncers
 and pegasus.<BR>
<BR><BR>




13. clean daily:<BR>  

<UL>
<LI><font color=red>nsform??.TMP</FONT COLOR=red> 
contains All the data inside every Netscape form 
you've ever submitted, with and without SSL, when  the submission failed 
or was cancelled.  
<LI> <font color=red>  Inbox, Outbox, Sent, Trash </FONT COLOR=red>  
has a complete copy of all your incoming, outgoing, 
sent, and soon-to-be-deleted email. All in  plain text without 
any encryption. 
<LI> <font color=red>   MsWord, Excel, Access, PowerPoint 
 </FONT COLOR=red> </UL>
   All these programs, as well as windows itself, cache the filenames of the 
most recent  documents you have been working on. This leads any attacker 
directly to your recent work!<BR>
<BR><BR>

14. DO NOT keep anything that can be used against you on your HD, but today, 
it's hard enough to know what that might be. Get a CD-burner if you can spare the 
cash or SEAQUEST drive or IOMEGA zip drive and keep the cartriges. To 
Learn to <font color=red>ENCRIPT</FONT> your data using one of the 
MANY diff encription programs available like
 <font color=red> Best Cript, ScramDisc</FONT> , ets.  
You can get PGP from <A HREF=http://web.mit.edu/network/pgp.html>MIT</A>. 
 PGP Faq is at:<A HREF="https://searchlores.nickifaulk.com/fiatlu/PGP.html">PGP FAQ</A><BR>

<FONT COLOR=red> NOTE:</FONT> Do a string search on 
<font color=red>   SECRING.PGP, Secring.SKR, .ASC  </FONT COLOR=red>, 
etc These will be YOUR secret keyrings, if you do happen to be using PGP! 
These are protected by your  passphrase, so I hope you've got a realllllly 
long one, and it's not something any average cracker will be able to pick, 
and you're not running any keypress macro recorders or typing sniffers, and 
you've not got any Trojan Horses or Password Targeted Viruses busy siphoning 
off your passwords and passphrases, and you trust all the software you run 
on yourPC, <BR>
<BR><BR>
Let's review: clean your Browser's caches, all the Index.dat files, 
temp folders, recent folder, wipe the freespace, the swap file, and the registery!
Don't you feel tired already??<BR>
<BR>

15. Lots of the programs you use daily leave many tracks behind of what you 
did last.So examples include:if you use <font color=red> ACDSEE</FONT>, 
clean the "move" pull down menu under the "move" icon it contains all the 
information about the jpegs you viewed and where they were moved to. Not 
cool.<BR>Did you know <A HREF=http://www.winzip.com>Winzip</A> creates a 
temporary file with the names of all the unzipped files? Look for it on C:\
 root dir. There you will find a neat list of all your extract actions...
There are possibilities to turn off the logging in both programs if you look
 in the  configuration menus, but I think that default is to keep logs, so 
check it out.. ;) Also, remove the "unzipped" file and everything inside.<BR>   
  Keep it clean :)  by WhiteSpider
<BR><BR><BR>Your<font color=red> SBNews</FONT> puts an .ini file 
(Newsbot.ini) in the Windows directory.     It contain plain text info 
about selected groups, host name etc.If you want to clean up your tracks, 
copy it to a safe backup folder after use and use 
<font color=red>BCwipe</FONT> or similar to delete the one in the Windows 
directory.Remember to put it back there before you use SBN the next time..If 
you don't, it will automatically create a new one, but all the info on 
download  directories, hosts etc. will be lost.Also keep in mind that SBN 
saves logfiles of all downloads in its program  Keep it clean :)<BR>   So 
install the program in a safe place.. ;)<BR>by WhiteSpider<BR><BR><BR>

 Did you KNOW that SBnews has a Dup file in its folder? thats how it keeps
 track of all the pix you have  d/ld. I am SURE other news-reader have
  the same folder somewhere in there, too. How to deal with that issue? 
personally, I dont know.Any suggestions? Maybe clean that file and when 
staring SBNEws look over whats there with "headers" and only choose what 
you want. Maybe disable the "dup" fucntion toowill be a good idea.<BR>

<CENTER><H4><font color=red>more Tweaking and cleaning up your Windoze
  tips
</FONT></H4></CENTER>

 Every week a new report hits the news about
 some newly discovered weakness in Windoze or somebody 
discovers something hidden inside. 
That's why I started this FAQ, to share everything I have discovered, 
in hope other people can ALSO benefit<BR>
<BR>



<LI> Perhaps old news for some but new to others...
1. In Windows98 I found a file called 'logfile.log'
It had recorded a LOT of info about activities.
I used Editpad to access file/clicked 'select all'/then hit Backspace/ then       
Re-Saved the file at 0 kb.
 Check it out on your PC's My logfile.log has stayed clean since.<BR>
<BR><BR>


<LI> Evidence Eliminator is rude and it starts up every time I reboot Windoze. 
to stop it I went to START+RUN, typed regedit and looked for this key:
<font color=red>
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SOFTWARE/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/Run
</FONT>. once inside, delete the Evidence Eliminator key. Of course you can
also prevent any other program from starting too while you are there...:-)<BR>

<BR><BR>


<LI>According to an article of the magazine Wired, some <font color=red>
ICQ </FONT>advanced users detected that the automatic mechanism of <font color=red>Update</FONT> installed by <font color=red>Mirabilis</FONT> might be used to obtain information directly from the hard disk of the users. <font color=red>AOL</FONT> just bought <font color=red>Mirabilis</FONT> and the <font color=red>ICQ</FONT> system must be one of the biggest data bank in the whole world.
So, as good safety precaution, these experts urge to turn this 
feature OFF.<BR>
To do that you need to Go to START+RUN
 start-menu and type "regedit" and look for this particular string:<font color=red>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Mirabilis\ICQ\DefaultPrefs</FONT>
Right-clik over the <font color=red>Key Auto Update</FONT>, select 
<font color=red>Modify</FONT> and enter <font color=red>No</FONT> 
That´s all. <BR>
<BR><BR>

<LI> If you REALLy want to remove all the previous installed software off your PC, you again need to edit the Win registery. Go to START+RUN
 start-menu and type "regedit". Go to <font color=red>
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SOFTWARE/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/Uninstall
</FONT>. 

Now you should see all programs that are installed on your computer, 
whether they exist or not. Just delete the ones you  don't have anymore. 
Oh yeah... Try at your own risk. If you delete the wrong thing the computer
 may crash.<BR>
Also, use the FIND option in the registery to find ANy traces of the software
you want removed and then use the delete function.<BR>
<BR><BR>





<LI> Suppose you want to change your name in Windows.
 To Change the Version, in Control Panel and System Properties :<BR>
<UL>
<LI>Open the Registry and collapse all of the branches so that all "Hotkey"
       folders are showing.<BR>
<LI>Find the Hotkey "Local Machine" folder and click the "+" sign in front
       of it.<BR>
<LI>Look for the Software Folder ( Microsoft Folder ) and click the "+" sign         
       in front of it.<BR>
<LI>Look for the Window Folder and click the "+" sign in

 front of it.<BR>

Look for the Current Version Folder and double-click 
on it.<BR>
<LI>On the right-hand side of the screen, look for the 
"Registered Owner File" and right click on it, then, 
then the Modify command.<BR>
<LI>Rename what you want computer to appear as on the 'net, then click OK.<BR>
<LI>Minimize the Registry and double click on System from within the 
       Control Panel.  You can now see the new name in the Version.<BR>
<BR><BR>  HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG
then Software, then MS, then windows, then CurrentVersion</UL><BR>
<BR><BR>

<LI> to look at the name your PC uses on a network, find your 
<font color=red>network neighborhood</FONT> icon, 
select <font color=red>properties</FONT>, then 
select the <font color=red>identification  tab
</FONT COLOR=red>. Right there is your computer's name, which could have been set by
some other piece of software.  Change it to something else, click on ok. 
I believe you'll have to reboot your computer before the change takes affect
<BR><BR>


<LI> Suppose you want to stop the 
CritialUpdate file in Windows 98 from updating Windowze 
without asking you. You need to do this then:
Start+Program+Accessories+System Tools+System Information+
Tools+System Configuration Utilities+Start up
Then uncheck the Critical Update and restart Windows<BR>
<BR><BR>

<LI>. <font color=red>ICQ </FONT COLOR=red>also likes to update itself without your
persmition. To show it who's da boss, do this:
go to Windoze Registry  with START+RUN
 start-menu and type "regedit". then open 
<font color=red>

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Mirabilis\ICQ\DefaultPrefs</FONT COLOR=red>
Auto Update "No" <BR>
<BR><BR>

<LI>.<font color=red>You can use several tricks to make your computer
 start faster.
       </FONT>

 <font color=red>Decrease StartUp items</FONT>: Applications that you
 don't use during a typical computing session may load themselves 
automatically at start-up. To find out which programs are auto-launching
 and stealing your system resources, go
 into Windows Explorer and open the following folder: 
  C:\Windows+Start Menu+Programs+StartUp

   Just right-click  on the ones you don't want to load at start-up and 
choose Delete from the pop-up menu. <BR>
<BR><BR>

<LI>  More sneaky StartUp items: You might have more unwanted stuff 
self-activating at start-up than what's listed in the StartUp folder. 
From the Start menu, choose Run and type MSCONFIG in the text box. 
Click on the StartUp tab. You'll see long list of items. All of those
 marked with an X launch automatically at StartUp. 
   Uncheck non-critical functions such as Tips (unless you like them), Task 
Monitor, and Load Power Profile (don't uncheck it if you use a notebook 
computer). Unchecking  Norton products such as CrashGuard and Anti-Virus 
will expedite the start-up process but will leave you more vulnerable to 
crashes and viruses.<BR>
<BR><BR>

<LI> Did you know that <font color=red>each time Windows 98 boots it 
searches for new floppy drives?</FONT COLOR=red> But when is the last time you installed a 
new floppy drive? To disable the ludicrous floppy drive scan go to: 

  1.Right-click on My Computer and select Properties.
  2.Click on the Performance tab followed by the File  System button.
//8+  3.Choose the Floppy Disk tab and uncheck Search for
   new floppy drives each time your computer starts.<BR> 
<BR><BR>


<LI>. Delete Auto Insert: You can tweak your CD-ROM drive
 to save a few CPU cycles by disabling Auto Insert  Notification-- the 
function that tells your computer to launch, say, your audio CD player 
when you stick that CD into the drive. Auto Insert Notification can be 
particularly annoying if you put a game CD into the CD-ROM drive and the 
Installation Wizard opens even though you've already installed the game 
onto your machine.
       disable Auto Insert Notification: 
 1.Right-click on My Computer and select Properties.
  2.Click on the Device Manager tab.
  3.Double-click on the CD-ROM icon and then double-click on the CD-ROM 
model you're currently  using.
