<H3>Introducing the IP (Internet Protocol)</H3>


What´s the IP? The topic of IP is a complex one, 
and here we can only touch on the basics. The reader is
actively encoureged to research  on their own. For the sake of
simplicity, we will say that the IP number is very much like a phone 
number, identifying EVERY computer ON the Internet with a specific number,  UNIQUE TO that particular computer.  The IP address is to the computer as your fingerprint is to you: it is unique, such that there cannot be two computers with the same IP address.<BR>
<BR>

 IP Internet addresses are 32-bit (4 bytes) long <i> logical</I> numbers,
 normally written as 4 bytes or octets (in decimal form) using the numbers 
0 to 255 and separated by periods, e.g. 128.24.206.18. Althought 8 bits have 256 possible combinations, the 0 and 356 are reserved. Both networks, hosts and clients can only use  0 through 254.<BR>
<BR>
Originally, addresses were broken into classes-A, B, C and the IP addresses
 were assigned by InterNIC (internet Network information Center)
the agency  responcible for Internet addressing and managment, and is 
currently owned by Network Solutions. The class system is no longer in use, 
but it still can provide an easy way to describe the networks. The first
octet or byte is the class. <BR>

Anything sent over the internet needs a 1.
<FONT COLOR=RED>specific origin</FONT COLOR=yellow> and 2. a 
<FONT COLOR=RED>specific destination</FONT COLOR=yellow>. For this 
reason, every computer must have it's own IP address.  The IP information
 is placed in the header of the data being transferred to ensure correct 
forward and return data transmission.<Br>
<Br>



<H3>So Watch your Trail!</H3>


Since your IP is attached every time you request a page, that IP address is 
sent to the page that you are browsing (along with a LOT of other personal 
information). What OTHER personal information?..Just about everything

about your computer- the OS, 
the name of your computer on the Net(from Net BIOS), 
(to check the name of your PC on the Net, do the following:
find your <FONT COLOR=RED>Network Neighborhood </FONT>Icon, 
select <FONT COLOR=RED>Properties</FONT>, 
then the <FONT COLOR=RED>Identification </FONT>tab. Right 
there is your computer's name,
which could have been set by some other piece of software. Change it to 
something else, click on ok. I believe you'll have to reboot your computer 
before the change takes affect) your email adrress,
the Time, the Date, Browser Type, 
Referer from(where you came from or the last web page before 
the current one even silly things like your screewn resolution, ets, ets
For more info on what information  your browser  sends out read the 
<A HREF="httpheaders.html">The Secret Life of your Web Browser Revealed!</A> FAQ . 

 All this info (IP address + everything else)

 can be recorded 
by the host site through Java/Javascript, a counter, 
. The newest idea is to include a counter one pixel
wide hidden inside an image to grab
your IP number.  Some Bulletin Boards even post your 
IP along with your post, making it 
available for anyone to see.  This is why we recommend
 using an anonymizer OR <A HREF="proxy.html">proxy </A>
whenever surfing the web, and 
<B>especially</b> when browsing unknown sites or 
posting to boards. See the next section 
(<A HREF="proxy.html">- Anonymous Surfing</A>) for 
more information on using anonymizers.

Hotmail and other "anonymous" mailers send your 
IP in the header of your message.  We suggest that 
you use an anonymous Remailer to send e-mail, and 
include your hotmail address (or other mail address 
not associated with your own ISP) in the message if 
you want a reply.  One good Remailer can be found at: 



<A HREF="http://www.gilc.org/speech/anonymous/remailer.html">

http://www.gilc.org/speech/anonymous/remailer.html</A>.<Br><Br>

For more Remailers, ideas, read <A HREF="check.html">Proxies and where to 
find them</A>,

Remember that its best too err on the side of 
caution.  The fewer that see your IP, the better.<Br>

<H3>Static vs. Dynamic IP's</H3>

The IP may be Static or Dynamic.  

A static connection means that your computer has one specific IP address 
assigned to it, and keeps that number irregardless of whether you are logged
 on or off the local network or the internet.  A dynamic IP means that when
 you log onto the network, your ISP (Internet Service Provider) assigns you
 the next available IP address from its bank of available addresses.  That
 address remains assigned to your computer until you log off.  The next time
 you log on to your ISP, you will most likely have a different IP number. 
 The ISP computer writes in its internal log file "at hour xxxx date xxx 
the user xxx is using the xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx account".
<Br>


Dynamic IP's are used by nearly every ISP.  The reasons for this are simple. 
 First, with more and more people accessing the internet, many with multiple
 accounts, there would be a shortage of available IP addresses if everyone 
had there own.  Also, assigning each computer a static IP would tend to make
 a mess for the backbone routing systems, causing fragmentation, and a great
 loss of efficiency of routing, resulting in longer transfer times.<Br>
<Br>



<H3>DNS (Domain Name System)</H3>

You know how you can just type <A HREF=http://www.microsoft.com>
www.microsoft.com</A> for example and you will be connected to them. Well 
this is accomplished with the <FONT COLOR=RED>Domain Name System </FONT 
COLOR=yellow>- DNS where an name is mapped to a particular IP address, since 
it is easier for us humans to rememeber a name than a string of numbers. 
This adress name sets itself together from all other names. 

As an example IP adress <FONT COLOR=RED>129.206.100.126</FONT> this is the
 combination for the <FONT COLOR=RED>ftp.urz.uni-heidelberg.de</FONT>
(university - heidelberg - germany)
On the left site ever stands the PC name in this example it is "ftp"
this name could be any other name too.The administrator sets it up.
The next is "urz" this keeps all the PC's in the calculating mashine center 
together.  Followed by the domain "uni-heidelberg" that keeps all the PC's 
from the whole university together.
And at last "de" it's the "top or level" domain for all PC's in Germany.<Br>
 <Br>




<H3> What about the ISP logs?</H3>
Okay, so now your ISP has a log of who 
is logged in under which IP number at any particular 
time.  They also maintain a log of data transfers, logging each 
transfer of information, the originating IP, and the destination IP. 
 So it might seem a routing process to do a search of the logs and 
find any illegal activity, and associate it with the exact computers 
involved.
<Br>


So why do the ISP's maintain logs of all internet activity?  Mostly for the
 purpose of debugging.  If the ISP servers develop a problem or they crash, 
technicians may scan the logs to determine if a particular transfer was 
involved with the problem.
<Br>




Now consider a normal day surfing the web.  In a normal day I can 
download/upload 2000 or 3000 files (the gifs of the pages, the wallpapers, 
etc. etc.).  Now if the ISP has 10000 or more clients (normally an ISP 
needs at least 10000 users to survive)that results in: 10000 x 3000 = 
30,000,000 operations in a day.  Every line has 128 lines (or bytes) =
 3.840.000.000 bytes...  wow!  The logs takes 3 Gigas from the disk !!! :) 
and I dont know an ISP who will waste this much memory for more 3 days. 
 Consider also the amount of time and money it takes to go through those 
logs looking for something that the ISP doesn't want to find in the first
 place.<Br>
<Br>









<H3>The Dangers...</H3>
However, if a federal agency has a 
search warrant with probable cause, they have the 
authority to demand a search of the logs.  If the logs for that time 
period are available, they can trace that data transfer to you.
  If almost anyone else gets your IP address and tries to identify 
you, they have practically no chance of doing so.<Br>


<Br>







Your biggest danger is if you are using a computer at 
work, at school, or in a public library.  They keep 
their own logs, which are usually much smaller than 
a regular ISP.  They also have more incentive to 
search their logs, to keep their image clean, and 
keep an eye on the activities of their 
employees/students.  We recommend that you do not use such computers for 
any questionable activity.
