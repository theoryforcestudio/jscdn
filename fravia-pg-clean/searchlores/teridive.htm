<br>Teri diver, a nice redheaded goddess, see 
if you can find this one specific pic on the web, and you 
will see that performing such a query you are in for a Rimbaudian "voyage a l'enfer"<br>Note that 
the "epoque" of this pic could also be of importance. Can you locate 
the year?<hr width=44%>
Also note that she is somehow "dick", and that legs - look at the silly shoes: her big feet 
protrude :-) and 
belly - too soft - are both somehow 
far from what I would call "redheaded goddess perfection". Nice piece of meat nevertheless, 
if you'll 
excuse my matter-of-fact language :-)</td><td width="20"></td><td width="280"><IMG align=center valign=top width=280
