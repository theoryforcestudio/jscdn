<FONT SIZE=+2> Getting da mp3 beef
<br>by TheLearner_<BR></FONT>published at fravia's searchlores in
february 2000<br>
<hr width=44%>Slightly edited by fravia+<hr width=44%><i>This  is useful 
for beginners, and some of the 'discard' logic used by TheLearner_ could indeed 
be of some use for all kind of searches -  
not only in order to find mp3 files. Enjoy!</i><hr></center>
  <font size=+1>
<P> Fravia.. looking
at your new searching site has   inspired me to actually write
down how I have searched   for something. I do not think I am a
great searcher,   the trade is just too easy to be elitist! But
 I had already chewed much of   the material found on your site 
(or is there an 'experienced' section?).<bR>So, I assume this little 'lesson' may be   beneficial
to those new at searching. <P> I'm sure you would never search for
my particular target, but I   was looking for a place to download mp3s
from a little   known heavy metal/techno band MDFMK. I did what
you   suggested which was to write down what I am looking  
for and time myself a maximum amount of 15 minutes. I completed this   search in
9:54 minutes! <P> Searching for mp3s is nowadays one of the most
common   searches. Normally, I don't even consider this kind of retrieval 
a real  
"search": I just logon to <font color=blue>[</fonT><a href="http://www.napster.com/">Napster</a><font color=blue>]</fonT>, and look for the   songs,
which *normally* are always there. But, this   time I had no luck: out of over
200,000 songs, and 1 terabyte of other   songs.. I could not find any
MDFMK songs at all! :( <P> Well I have now found napster, which I
recommend! You get there   around <u>a terabyte</u> (or 1000GBs) of songs all
the time: no more broken links, no more slow downloads, and no more busy, 
disorganized FTP sites... Anyway, before Napster 
I   looked for music either on IRC, or Homemade FTPs.<bR>
I DO   NOT RECCOMEND GETTING SONGS THROUGH THESE TWO PATHS!! They can
  be used only as a last resort.<bR>On IRC, simply go into one   of
the huge mp3 channels (cablemp3) and use @locator  
&lt;song/band/ect.&gt;, then follow the bots instructions.  
For the ftps, I recommend you use CuteFTP or another   FTP
program, search for the song/band at one of those   mp3 FTP
depositories (such as mp3.box.sk,   mp3search.lycos.com,
www.audiogalaxy.com, www.oth.net,   and I suppose  <A
HREF="http://ftpsearch.lycos.com)" TARGET="_new"><FONT
COLOR="BLUE">http://ftpsearch.lycos.com)</FONT></A> from there,
  it's a guessing game normally, to see which FTPs are   not
busy, have ratios, have been taken down, need you to survive 
a   barrage of
banner clicking... its a hell out there! So, go there as a LAST resort!! Ok..
this is how I started out.. <P> Naspter's search for MDFMK gave me... 
nothing!! Now I had   to actually work for something, this is
when I started   the clock :) <P> I searched for 'MDFMK mp3
download' at google.com. Good ole google   returned a whopping 14 results 
    <br>You may want to quickly scan with your eyes the following block.

<P> I totally disregarded all of these.<bR>MP3.com has
  nothing<bR>Undernet is IRC, and that's the LAST thing to  
do<bR>MobiusB - Music Links &lt;-- said MP3.com
<bR>Bookmarks   for
Jason &lt;-- No personal pages, they always have   nothing<br>uf
nimmerwierdersehen &lt;-- My first instinct   was 'english
please?' then the caption said garbage   about NIN, and a
personal site isn't going to have   those two on it<bR>| m | d |
f | m | k | &lt;-- I   recognized this, this is from the
official mdfmk site,   they sure as hell aren't going to have
their mp3's!   :)<bR> Wicked Land - News Archive &lt;-- more
MP3.com BS<bR> Northwest Underground &lt;-- 'download songs'
caught my   eye, and I clicked on this, but alas, it's been
taken   down, the cached web page won't help me coz I want the
  mp3s.<bR>Re: Genre busting (was Re: Re: Re: babble in  
pews) &lt;-- this is another one I clicked on, the   message
board caught my eye, and It could have a link   to the songs,
but it didn't and the listing was over. <P> I thought about what I
had read on fravia's site, and   I came up with ..USENET!! A
fast deja.com search led   me to alt.music.mdfmk. Now .. if the
band has it's own   alt.music.place, let's leave deja to its crap advertisements and 
let's go directly to the beef. So I loaded up
netscape   to peruse there. And I came across a pretty little thread...

:) <P>    So my final results for the MDFMK album is  <P>  <A
HREF="http://mp3.freediskspace.com/Folders/649292/">http://mp3.freediskspace.com/Folders/649292/</A>
   with the shared folder password of 'mdfmk'  <bR> And the
stopped clock is at 5:06, so this search took   a total 9:54.<hr>
<P> This is my recommendation for finding a song in MP3   form:
<P><ul><li> 1) Search in Napster. </li><li>  2) Look in the bands USENET forum.
  (alt.music.&lt;bandhere&gt;)   </li><li>  3) Search the engines.  
 </li><li> 4) Look in the 'homemade FTPs' </li><li>    5) Look in IRC <P> and also,
Note that I am sure that ICQ has stuff like that as well, 
but I'm   not into it, so at eventual 
6th place, search inside ICQ :) <P> I hoped this has helped anyone to find mp3s,
remember   as always, to buy the CD after, if you like the
band,   support them!
