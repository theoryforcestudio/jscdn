Subject: Lab 1 fun

Hello Fravia

Here's my solutions to Lab 1:

#1 Aqua Barbie

Hmm google query &quot;Aqua Barbie&quot; finds lyrics, so we can asume it's a song
or band name, a further google seeking of '&quot;Aqua Barbie&quot; +.mp3'
</pRE><font size=-1>
http://www.google.com/search?num=30&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22Aqua+Barbie%22+.mp3&amp;btnG=Google+Search
</font><pre>
Result #1 ( hehe ):

http://gnute.com/search/s=aqua/type=1/offset2/index.html

and from there to the file somewhere on someone's Gnutella net:

http://dy-www.sc.cninfo.net/xxyl/music/mp3/english/Barbie_Girl.mp3

Time elapsed: &lt; 1 minute

#2 Ovid's Amore III

An easy one, thanks to google. The query string: &quot;Ingenium quondam fuerat&quot;:
</pRE><font size=-1>
http://www.google.com/search?num=30&amp;meta=hl%3D%26lr%3D&amp;q=%22Ingenium+quondam+fuerat%22
</font><pre>
and result #5 (after 4 pointing to you :-P) is:

http://pot-pourri.fltr.ucl.ac.be/files/AClassFTP/TEXTES/Ovide/ovid_amor3.txt

Time elapsed: however long it takes to copy+paste into new google window
(+/-3 seconds)

#3 Web plagarism:

A tricky one, in that the phrase was changed though the idea still
remains, it is not a bitwise copy of the original, hence the 'plagiarism':


A search for a modified phrase:

&quot;The industry standard remains&quot; on FAST
</pRE><font size=-1>
http://www.alltheweb.com/cgi-bin/search?type=all&amp;query=%22The+industry+standard+remains%22&amp;exec=FAST+Search
</font><pre>
yelds 8 results the eighth of which has a title &quot;Digital Images&quot;... 
looks promising :-)

http://www.freenetpages.co.uk/hp/paulbroad/18digit.htm (mind that you
don't let fast snarf your URL going through it, cut the URL out of their
referrer link)

The text on this page reads:

&quot;There are an increasing number of image manipulation programs available
of which the industry standard remains PHOTOSHOP. However, this is very
expensive and has a steep learning curve. I have tried a number of
programs, and they all have their strong and weak points.

I always come back to Paintshop Pro, which is reasonably priced shareware.
The old version 3 was excellent and the newer version 4 and now 5 are even
more so. There is little point entering the field of digital imaging
without adequate software and a suitable printer.&quot;

Time elapsed: 5-6 minutes trying various length and snippits until finally
I dropped the word &quot;professional&quot; then it was one search away...

#4 Submarine Badge:

A Soviet Diesel submarine with the numeral 300 below it. 300 may be a Unit
number, but we'll see. A google search for:

http://www.google.com/search?num=30&amp;meta=hl%3D%26lr%3D&amp;q=soviet+naval+medals

and the _first link_ is: http://www.collectrussia.com/ (ooh pictures...
seem to be heading true)

&gt;From there we look for Navy-related links, the fovea picks this one first:

http://www.collectrussia.com/showcat.htm?cat=NAVAL

... no dice, but then there's:

http://www.collectrussia.com/showcat.htm?cat=COMMNAVAL

and we find Aha! the number '300'

click!: http://www.collectrussia.com/DISPITEM.HTM?ITEM=618

and there it is!

http://www.collectrussia.com/images/300navy.jpg

Time elapsed: 2 minutes. (if that)

#5 'PATH-FINDer&quot; seeking quest:

Well, I must say that your sentance &quot;[Files] Old files elementary
searching - perusing old alleys of the web&quot; gave it away instantly, so off
to simtel I went, ( http://www.simtel.net/pub/pd/45290.shtml ) and there
it was. Then a quick click on to ftp-search ( nee Trondheim, alas the
server isn't _there_ anymore ) with the query of 'pathfind.zip' est
voilla: ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/.1/garbo/garbo_pc/filefind/pathfind.zip .

Time elapsed: 2-3 minutes (pesky auto download didn't work (java and
j-script off) went to ftp-search, hence extra minute... :)

---

I did this lab in reverse order, from 5-1, as I thought I'd just have a
poke at the last one for kicks, but then went on to the rest after I found
the path, eheh...

This was fun, and I think that while I wrote each description after each
search, there is a lot of heuristics left out, internalized reliances on
memory ( like knowing of simtelnet for years and years...) and other
seeking feelings and mysticism that has no words really...
