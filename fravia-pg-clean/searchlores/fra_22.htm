The aureate scam... and how to scam aureate<br>

by fravia+
</font><br><br><font size=+1>This isn't a "real" reversing essay, I'm just presenting a funny 
(yet working) easy trick... <i>non semper ea sunt quae videntur</i>
<hr width=66% align=left>
<br>
It's almost Xmas, eh, supermarkets, malls and virtual e-shops 
are full 7/7 and 24/24 of people "consuming" themselves black and blue... 
and who am I to avoid our societal "obligation" to make 
presents on command? <br>
I would like to offer as my own first Xmas present to 
all readers (yep, not only reversers) a simple yet effective method to get rid of 
advertisement banners inside "free" (or after all "not so free") software.<br><br>
Some days ago I was investigating the aureate spysystem<br>
This sniffing approach 
    consists of various dll-libraries and executable files, that are run every time
you connect to the Web.
    Aureate seems to collect quite a lot of info... your name (an entry in the 
    system registry), 
    a listing of the software that
is installed on your system
    (entries in the system registry) and "your web
surfing habits", i.e. what sites you have
    visited and what "banners" you have clicked onto (assuming that someone 
     really clicks on banners, 
    which I fail to believe).<br><br>
Now, in a world where even small commercial firms can now offer on sale 
aerial fotographs with
 <font color=blue>[</font><a href="http://www.eurimage.com/cities/index.shtml">1 meter resolution</a><font color=blue>]</font>  such attacks on 
our privacy are almost irrelevant  
(frightening eh?  And it's a five years old technology...  
think what any average secret agency could do now), but I'm digressing. Back to Aureate.
    <br><br>
You can easily check if you already have 
this Aureate sniffing system inside 
your own  
 windoze box right now (and, oh-boy, chances are that you indeed have it without even 
 noticing it): <font color=blue>[</font><a href="file://localhost/c:/Windows/system/">click here with the right mouse button</a><font color=blue>]</font> and 
choose "open in new window", now scroll a little and see if you have a dll called 
"<font color=blue>advert.dll</font>" (yes you most prolly do&nbsp;:-).<br><br>
I wont go now into the intricacies of advertisement-based statistical methods... 
basically, 
as anyone knows nowadays, the commercial bastards are ready to tramp over your dead kids' bodies 
in order to fetch some of your personal data in order to stuff 
their databases (so that they can re-sell them to other similar 
bastards). Some of the aureate DLLs set (mostly trough port 1749) a "plug" into your box. Each user is given a unique user ID by the Aureate system, 
thus allowing quite complex spying activities. Note also that the Aureate system actively sends 
and receives data over the web even when the advertising-trojan program is not running or <u>has been 
deleted or deinstalled</u>!<br>
You'll find all the necessary explanations 
<font color=blue>[</font><a href="http://www.altavista.com/cgi-bin/query?pg=q&text=yes&kl=XX&q=%2Baureate+%2Bspy%2A&act=search">here</a><font color=blue>]</font>. 
<br><br>Keep in mind 
that in the silly world we are living in, a lot is due to 'user inattention': many 
tricks are allowed and blessed by a social system that encourages fraud and 
discourages (or even punishes) "reversing frauds": when accepting "free
software", lusers often blithely skip through the
fine print that displays
across their monitors. The fact that more and more people are installing 
&quot;always-on&quot; broadband
connections to the
Internet is a godsend for all kind of advertisement bastards: a friend of mine was 
scared to hell after I suggested him to install blackICE (network ice aka "blackice", see 
<font color=blue>[</font><a href="http://www.altavista.com/cgi-bin/query?sc=on&hl=on&q=%2Bfosi+%2Bblackice&kl=XX&pg=q&Translate=on&text=yes&search=Search">fosi</a><font color=blue>]</font>   if 
you don't have the money to pay it):  you'r most probably <u>thoroughly</u> 
sniffed at least a dozen 
times during each one of your Internet sessions (again, if you don't believe it, <font color=blue>[</font><a href="http://www.altavista.com/cgi-bin/query?sc=on&hl=on&q=%2Bsniffing+%2B%28blackice+OR+adsl%29+&kl=XX&pg=q&Translate=on&text=yes&search=Search">check</a><font color=blue>]</font>   it).
<br><br>Chances are that you have Aureate sitting in the guts of your system 
 if you have installed just one single application out of a 
<font color=blue>[</font><a href="http://www.altavista.com/cgi-bin/query?sc=on&hl=on&q=%2B%22advert.dll%22&kl=XX&pg=q&Translate=on&text=yes&search=Search">growing
 number</A><font color=blue>]</font>   of 
so-called "free" applications that compel you to slurp advertisements "in exchange" of their 
graciously being oh so free..<BR>
<BR>
Among other "aureatish" spysoftware there are CuteFTP, Crystal FTP, Go!Zilla and many 
other wide used 
programs (most of them, for obvious reasons, being FTP or URL-gathering applications,
 see <font color=blue>[</font><a href="http://www.altavista.com/cgi-bin/query?sc=on&hl=on&q=%2B%22advert.dll%22&kl=XX&pg=q&Translate=on&text=yes&search=Search">this 
list</A><font color=blue>]</font> or the link  above to fetch various more or less 
"complete" lists of them).
<br><br>
Now I know that most readers are NOT reversing savvy experts, and therefore I'll show you a very 
simple method of disabling both the eyes-irritating ads inside the software and destroying 
the "validity" of 
the whole aureate's  
spying system bazar through a trick so easy to apply that even the aunt of 
your girl-friend will be able to 
do it by herself (and you'r girl-friend will thank you for it)... <br><br>So, without no longer ado... here is what you can do to heal 
your box (if you'r 
really so unhappy that you have to use windoze instead of GNU/Linux... but beware the appearence of 
Linux aureate programs).
This approach is moreover so straightforward and 
easy that anyone will be able to apply it on the fly&nbsp;:-) How nice...<br>
<br>Pass auf reader! Now we come to the interesting Xmas present... 
in order to 
screw (back)  black and blue ALL SOFTWARE with embedded sniffing functions made by 
these Aureate clowns, simply go to your windows/system subdirectory 
and boldly and quietly <u>RENAME</u> following files:
<pre>AMSTREAM DLL ---> AMSTREAM FRV  81,920  23/04/99  22:22 amstream.frv
ADVPACK  DLL ---> ADVPACK  FRV  89,360  03/12/99  06:08 advpack.frv
AMCOMPAT TLB ---> AMCOMPAT FRV  16,832  27/10/00  19:20 amcompat.frv
AMCIS    DLL ---> AMCIS    FRV  45,056  01/04/99  14:52 amcis.frv
</pre><hr>Nachtrag March 2001<br><font size=-1>
<i>Josh pointed out that AMSTREAM.DLL, ADVPACK.DLL and AMCOMPAT.TBL are not real Aureate files, 
and are used respectively for MS multimedia functions, MS installations, and ActiveMovie 
components, and suggested that only AMCIS.DLL needs to be renamed. However, 
field experimentations still seem to prove that all four the above files must be renamed in 
order to kill Aureate fully. Further observations on these matters would be <a href="http://www.searchlores.org/info.htm#write">welcome</a>. 
</i></fonT>
<hR>
<font size=+1>
Note that datestamps and hourstamps often betray WHICH trojan "free" software did install 
these bugs-files... anyway, renaming these four dll (of course not necessarily to *.frv... be inventive) should be enough to cover 
<u>all</u> aureate snooping trojan on your system. Should you have some kind of funny 
problems (you wont, but one never knows: <i>in doubt always disclaim</i>&nbsp;:-) just 
rename them back to their original *.dll extension. At that point it 
would be nice if you could - if possible and capable -
start a little research 
on your own and try to pinpoint the culprit application, or even better, the parts of the code 
that are doing it, 
and then (if after having worked a while on such matters you deem such info important) send your findings over to me...<br><br>ACHTUNG: 
Do not, I repeat DO NOT, rename <font color=blue>advert.dll</fonT>, leave that library ALONE.<br> 
Rest assured that this "trojan dll" wont "work" for aureate 
without its  dll-syblings (that you renamed into the void), so don't worry. On the other hand, 
if you directly attack it and 
rename it, it will -alas- 
screw your "oh so free" applications after you have nuked it (on purpose: these people are evil).
<br>
<br>Once you have renamed the four files I have listed above, you'll be free from aureate 
sniffing AND from compelled advertisement banners! You don't believe me? 
Just have a look at the wondrous new "post-fravian eingriff" 
developments through a given target: start, for 
instance, 
Crystal FTP 2000, a nice ftp-program but, alas, aureate-advertisement infested 
(if you don't have nor use Crystal FTP, 
 start whatever other Aureate-pushing application you wish)... woah... the program runs fine and... no more ads... 
 yep, that's it... commercial bastards annihilated through windoze's RENAME function, 
 ahah... <i>quod erat demonstrandum...</i> <br><br>
 Merry Xmas to all of you, enjoy some nice <font color=blue>[</font><a href="http://www.alltheweb.com/cgi-bin/asearch?type=all&query=%2Bpanettone+%2B%22tre+marie%22">Tre Marie</a><font color=blue>]</font> Panettone ("buono e basso") if you 
 manage to find it...
