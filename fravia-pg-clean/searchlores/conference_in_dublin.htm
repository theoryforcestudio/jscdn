<br>
Excuse my English, please, which is my third language, 
and please note that I'm not sure I'll always be able to be politically correct.
 (That's one among the many reasons why I prefer to use a pseudonym instead of my "real" name)<br>
 With this talk I hope to show you how to search effectively the web, and hence 
 give you <font color=blue>cosmic power</font>, no more and no less.  
<br>
 
 Once you know how to search the web, 
 the entire human knowledge will become available, at your disposal.<br>
 To give you a silly example, using google, we will see how a simple "moronical" query like
 <br>
 <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&q=%22index+of%22+warez&btnG=Search">"index of" warez</a> 
 has your target 
 signal 
 submerged under such a heavy commercial noise to be next to useless.
 <br>
 So what should you use instead? (In the rather unlikely event  you would look for software on the web&nbsp;:-)<br>
 Well, a query like the following should cut more mustard:
 <br>
 <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&hl=en&lr=&q=%28%22wares%22+OR+%22warez%22+OR+%22appz%22+OR+%22gamez%22+OR+%22abandoned%22+OR+%22pirate%22+OR+%22war3z%22%29+%28%22download%22+OR+%22ftp%22+OR+%22index+of%22+OR+%22cracked%22+OR+%22release%22+OR+%22full%22%29+%28%22nfo%22+OR+%22rar%22+OR+%22zip%22+OR+%22ace%22%29&btnG=Search">("wares" OR "warez" OR "appz" OR "gamez" OR "abandoned" OR "pirate" OR "war3z") ("download" OR "ftp" OR "index of" OR "cracked" OR "release" OR "full") ("nfo" OR "rar" OR "zip" OR "ace")</a>

<br>
This is just an example, and using just one of the <a href="main.htm">main</a> search engines. Always remember that 
the main search engines (at the moment the most important ones are google, yahoo, msn and teoma) cover -at best- just a third 
of the whole web... <IMG SRC="images/bulletr.gif" ALT="red" align="bottom" valign="bottom" WIDTH="13"
HEIGHT="13">&nbsp;
<br><br>
So the problem is to wade  through the slimy commercial morasses of the web, which were 
made specifically "ad captandum vulgus", and to quickly "cut" 
this useless ballast in order to find our targets.
<br>
<br>We'll use google a lot as an example, but 
we'll see today various different ways to fetch "by hand" your targets. I say "by hand" because real seekers try to 
automate the process as much as possible and usually employ ad hoc <a href="bots.htm">bots</a> to do the gritty digging. But that's 
for later, first the basic.<br><br>
Let's first have a short look at what  <a href="conference_in_dublin.htm#structure">the web looks like from a searcher's point of view</a>.
<br>
<font color=blue>Outside linkers</font> are fetched through klebing (and stalking and social engineering), 
<font color=blue>the bulk</font> and the <font color=blue>outside linked </font> 
through combing and short and long term seeking, the hidden and commercial databases through 
password breaking or <a href="magicfi.htm">guessing</a>, social engineering or, more simply, just seeking 
databases' 
hardcoded passwords  (ï¿½ la 
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&safe=off&as_qdr=all&q=borland+%22politically+correct%22+interbase&btnG=Search">Borland Interbase's 
"politically correct"</a>) on the web. <br>Here for instance one of these lists: 

  <a href="http://www.searchlores.org/defpasslist1.htm">defpasslist1.htm</a>
<br><br>
In fact the web was made for SHARING information, not for "hoarding" nor for "selling" it. And 
it was made quite solid: its structure was made 
in order to resist a possible nuclear attack. It will resist even the commercial beasts that 
have tried to bury real useful information under tons of commercial crap, aggressive commercial 
porn sites and an avalanche of silly and useless advertisements.<br>
Learning how to search, you'll be able to "cut" through the commercial pudding and morasses and 
fetch quickly (or relatively quickly) your target jewels.<br>
<br>

But to "cut" the Web you'll need first of all  a SWORD with a sharp blade: a capable and quick browser. 
That's the first and foremost 
step. MSIE, Microsoft Internet explorer is a no-no-no, too buggy, bloated and prone to all sort of nasty attacks. The 
two current "philosophical  schools" are either Firefox or Opera... which is the one I am using now.<br><br>
Whatever of the two "real" browsers you use, no sword will be enough without a SHIELD. And your shield, 
and a mighty one, is <font color=blue>proxomitron</font>. <br>
Proxomitron is a very powerful tool. Its power lies 
in its ability to <font color=blue>rewrite webpages on the fly</font>, <font color=blue>filter communications between 
your computer and the web servers of the sites you visit</font>, and to <font color=blue>allow easy management of external proxy use</font>.
<br>
Here a 
link to an old, but very good essay about proxomitron basic installation: <a href="anony_8.htm">anony_8.htm</a>, and a link 
to 
another essay, <a href="proxopro_1.html">Oncle Faf goes inside proxomitron</a> about further finetuning.... Let's sum it up: 
<i>"Only morons 'just do it' without <a target=_top href="http://www.searchlores.org/zipped/ProxN44.zip">Proxomitron</a>."</i>



<br><br>
<font color=blue>A word of warning</font>: You'll most probably forget most of the things you'll learn today rather quickly, since most 
young people (and many elder ones as well) after having been heavily bombarded by advertisements 
from their birth onwards, have nowadays an attention span of just a few minutes and a memory as weak 
as an autumn leaf. But  -I hope- you'll know more or less the basic of searching correctly the web. 
<br>So, should you forget, 
for instance, how to quickly find mp3s, you'll be able to use your <font color=blue>combing</font> knowledge to quickly find on the web 
those that will teach you how to find mp3 quickly. Or maybe even <b>their</b> teachers&nbsp;:-)

<br>
You'll find more about "free" email in the <a href="freemail.htm">ad hoc section</a> of my site, the 
 most important things is to NEVER give out real data on the web unless you are really compelled to do so (and 
 even in that case there are many ways to avoid it). 
 <br><br>
 Always choose the first option, whatever it is, 
when you (have to) "choose" some options from a menu ("Your income", "Your profession", Your "State" and so on): 
State=Afganistan, Income=less than 15 euro per year and so on... 
If you want to play, there are some funny logistical options like "American Samoa" "Fortune and Wallys 
 Islands" and so on.<br> The option "other" that you often find on these  menus is also great, because you will get 
 the wannabye sniffers thinking hard about updating their long palette of options, adding even more  crap to their possible choices.
 
 <br><br>
 Do not feel bad while feeding  only lies to anyone asking for your data on line: such people 
 are just scum that will use EVERYTHING you will tell them for profit the very moment you do, 
 and they don't even have the decency to admit it. Screw them black and blue, such 
 clowns deserve far worse than that: never believe for a minute that their 'privacy - 
 pleads' about how they will "never use your data" could be anything else than cheap sarcasm.
 <br>
 The 
 very reason they did set up such "free" email addresses sites (and such "free" search engines and 
 "free" file repositories) is -of course- to 
 READ everything you write and to have a copy of everything you upload or create.<br> 
 Of course, klaro, no human being will ever read what you write, but their bots and grepping 
 algos will do it for the owners of the "free" email services 
 (or of the "free" search engines), presenting them 
 nice tables built on your private data as a result.
 <br>
 This brings us to a very interesting contradiction: on one site "echelon" and 
 the total big broterish control, on the other "wardriving" and pretty good anonymity... <IMG SRC="images/bulletr.gif" ALT="red" align="bottom" valign="bottom" WIDTH="13"

<br>Well, I'll try my hand at it, at risk of being ridiculous in your eyes... In fact it is often very dangerous -for any seeker- 
to claim that he can really find things on the fly&nbsp;:-)<br> 
Let's see together, in front of a competent professional crowd, the results of a seeker's attempt to 
find "<font color=blue>the best Guinness in Dublin</font>" BEFORE coming here... <br>The didactical aspect will be evident once we examine, 
at the end, the simple querystrings I have used.<br><br> 
Some insist that Guinness at its best can only be had in Ireland, and more specificaly in Dublin. "It doesn't travel well", they say.<br> 
Furthermore, as every beer lover knows, a pint drawn in a pub is always far superior to the bottled version. 
And it takes an expert bartender to 
"pull a pint" just right, so that it finishes off with a head of creamy foam so thick you can 
carve your initials in it.
<br><br>Well, this is what I have found...<br>

<ol><li>
<font color=blue>The Guinness brewery</font> (guinness, but they won't give away the source code). &nbsp;&nbsp;
 The former Guinness Hop Store on Crane Street houses an exhibition centre and the gravity bar 
 where you can taste (according to them) "<font color=blue>the best Guinness in Dublin</font>". 
 </li><li>
<font color=blue>Mulligans</font> off Tara Street & not far from the Screen Cinema, in Poolbeg Street. 
Another institution and home 
to "<font color=blue>the best Guinness in Dublin</font>".
</li><li>
<font color=blue>Porterhouse</font> on Parliament street (street opposite Dublin Castle).<br> 
The beer on offer - from the session beer Porterhouse Red to the 7% BrainBlasta, and 
the hundreds of bottled beers from around the world, is second to none.<br>
If you bring them a beer they don't have, they give you a free beer (in the old days - free beers all evening!)<br>


</li><li>
<font color=blue>Nesbits</font> on Baggot Street (beyond Merrion Square - go to the top of Merrion Street & turn left) 
a beautiful Victorian exterior and wood-panelled interior. Alas -they say- frequented by boring, money-oriented, zombies.<br>
Or, rather, in the same Baggot street, with  a nicer and less pretentious fauna:<br> 
 <font color=blue>Toners</font> on Baggot Street, a very small bar, 
  fairly packed most nights... in the afternoons this is the best bar in Dublin, particularly if you manage 
  to take possession of the wonderful window snug, 
  which can be easily defended against invaders.<br>
  Has  arguably "<font color=blue>the best Guinness in Dublin</font>".


</li><li>
<font color=blue>The Brazen Head</font>, 
20 Bridge Street,<br>

The oldest pub in Dublin, and a must for every pub-lover. The only pub in Dublin with a courtyard. 
"<font color=blue>The Guinness is among the best you will find in Dublin</font>"
</li><li>
<font color=blue>O'Neills</font> on Pearse Street (near one of the back gates to Trinity).
</li><li>
...or get out of town, take the Dart to Booterstown & try <font color=blue>the Punch Bowl</font> 
(near the station). Otherwise, there are <font color=blue>lots of pubs in Blackrock</font> (the following Dart station). 
</li></ol>
So, as you can see, there seem to be no lack of places where you can taste "<font color=blue>the best Guinness in Dublin</font>". 
How can you (quickly) evaluate which one(s)
 you should really visit?<br>There seem to be some simple rules:
<br>
1)  Generally, the farther away from Dublin you are, the worse the Guinness gets.
<br>
2) Generally, the farther away from Ireland you are, the worse the Guinness gets.
<br>
(It doesn't travel well...)
<br><br>So I would go for <font color=blue>Mulligans</font> and  for <font color=blue>Toners</font> and I would
 forget the bad frequented Nesbit and the "Gravity" guinness' brewery bar, despite its probably good stout. Yes, despite! While 
 substance is always king, <font color=blue>form</font> cannot be ignored, especially when -reversing it- 
 you note that it gives you <font color=blue>negative vibes</font>.<br> 
Judging from the images the Gravity place seems shrill and "made like a Macdonald", a sterile and "anti-cosy" place 
with the obvious express purpose of pushing people quickly away and 
increment its turnover... get lost. Seekers usually love "slow food" places, 
where they can concentrate on their next queries&nbsp;:-)
<br>
<br>
Now it is up to you to judge if these <font color=blue>guinness' conclusions of mine</font>, pulled from air-searchstrings, are indeed correct or 
rather off the mark...
<br>
...this said, all these Guinness' stouts looks to me like being served everywhere a tag too cold nowadays&nbsp;:-)
<br><br>
And here are the strings I have used:<br>

<br>As you can see the three strings  may look quite straightforward to all of you now...<br><br>
<font color=blue size=+2>Microsoft sliders, the anti-google weapon?</font>
<br>
Please take your time to 
investigate the first (microsoft) searchstring used in the above guiness' example. 
<br>Use the three <font color=blue>sliders</font>  by yourself!<br> (Note how the morons at microsoft hide them instead of 
being proud of them: click onto <a href="http://search.msn.com/advanced.asp?qb=1">http://search.msn.com/advanced.asp?qb=1</a> 
and then click "result ranking")
<br> Would Microsoft implement MORE sliders, they 
would probably beat google (provided Microsoft increments its poor database and learn to be less americanocentric). These SLIDERS 
give THE USER the possibility to finetune (correctly) the searching algo. Basically, instead of 
trusting some idiot in Arizona to know what's good for your search, you decide that -say- "<font color=blue>less popular</font>" 
is a better choice BECAUSE "popular" searches are what peasants in Idaho are searching for&nbsp;:-)
<br><br>
Finally note that I haven't used any <a href="regional.htm">regional</a> irish search engine, 
because -alas- there are no real useful local search engines in Ireland: the few existing ones:<br> 
www.niceone.com, 
www.irishsearch.net, 
www.browseireland.com,
www.indexireland.com, 
www.whoisireland.com and
www.irishsites.com<br>  have all  very little content and very little traffic. Yep, sometime you just cannot go regional enough&nbsp;:-(

<br>
There's a whole section regarding <a href="books.htm">books</a> at searchlores, so I won't get 
into these simple targets much. Suffice to say that all books mankind has written are mostly already on the web somewhere, 
and that while we are sitting here, hic et nunc, hundreds of fully scanned <font color=blue>libraries</font> are going on line... if you'r attentive enough, 
and if your searching scripts are good, you can 
even hear the clincking "thud" of those huge databases going on line...  
<IMG SRC="images/bulletr.gif" ALT="red" align="bottom" valign="bottom" WIDTH="13"
HEIGHT="13">&nbsp;<br><br>In order to fetch books you just need some correct strings.<br>

A simple trick is to use <a href="http://a9.com/-/search/advSearch">the powerful A9 engine</a>, 
for instance, for conan doyle,
 <a href="http://a9.com/conan%20doyle?a=obooks">http://a9.com/conan%20doyle?a=obooks</a> 
 and then fetch <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0553328255/ref=sib_rdr_next3_ex17/102-1260521-5632156?%5Fencoding=UTF8&p=S00P&ns=1#reader-page">the 
 study 
 in scarlet</a>.
 <br>
 Of course once we have <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22He+is+sure+to+be+at+the+laboratory%22+%22returned+my+companion.%22&num=100&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8">some arrows</a>, it is 
 relatively easy to fetch whole copies of a book all over the web...
<br><br>
Of course this is also true for all kind of copyrighted books... let's see:
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22I+have+no+fitting+gifts+to+give+you+at+our+parting,%22&hl=en&lr=&filter=0">"I have no fitting gifts to give you at our parting,"</a>...
<br>
and we land here, for instance: <a href="http://bbs5.xilubbs.com/cgi-bin/bbs/view?forum=wlqbq&message=564"> 'I  have no fitting  gifts  to  give you at our parting,' said Faramir;
`but take these staves...</a> 

<br>
<br>A typical example of the joys of good web-fishing: 
<a href="ftp://ftp.cdut.edu.cn/">ftp://ftp.cdut.edu.cn/</a> let's see if you can imagine, "a ritroso" the querystrings you may use to fetch such a site
 (this kind of approach is 
 a useful seekers' exercise as well).

</center>
<br>
A completely new wave of music searching has opened through the relatively recent 
<a href="musicblogs.htm">mp3 blogs</a> phenomenon, but usually it is MUCH  simpler to just fetch the music you 
need from the web any time you need it.
<br>
Most simple trick:<br>
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&q=m4a+%22index+of%22+dylan&btnG=Search">m4a "index of" dylan</a>
For instance:<br>
<a href="http://www.stud.ntnu.no/~nikgol/21-11-2004/">http://www.stud.ntnu.no/~nikgol/21-11-2004/</a>
<br>
Or even this, found with the previous query, so big that it may crash our browsers...
<br>
<a href="http://24.91.184.80/jserver/files/music/">http://24.91.184.80/jserver/files/music/</a>

<br><br>
A more complex webbit:<br>
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22icons/sound2.gif%22+%22index+of%22+mp3&sourceid=opera&num=0&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8">"icons/sound2.gif" "index of" mp3</a>

Consider this your "assignement" from this talk.<br>
Play with the following strings THIS EVENING OR TOMORROW and you may (may) even remember some of this stuff 
despite your probably poor memory and attention span&nbsp;:-)

<br>For instance:<br>
<a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=U&start=6&q=http://barnes.bloomu.edu/bb/&e=10094">http://www.google.com/url?sa=U&start=6&q=http://barnes.bloomu.edu/bb/&e=10094</a>


<br><br>

Here, for those of you that want to flex their seeking muscles, another assignment for the next days<br>
Try these (old and already overused) arrows <font color=blue>on various</font> search engines. 
Each one of them should give you plenty of interesting searching paths to follow&nbsp;:-)

<a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=25&hl=en&q=synecdoche+term+rhetoric&btnG=Google+Search&sourceid=fravia" target="_blank">Synecdoche</a> ("sin-EK-doh-kee") is the rhetorical or metaphorical
substitution of a part for the whole, or vice versa. This approach is widely used in searching, 
because it allows you to get at your signal 'from the bottom', eliminating part 
of the noise.<br><br>
For some specific examples see <a href="synecdoc.htm">synecdoc.htm</a>. 
<br>
Here let's just have "a visual look" at a search:
<br><br>
The red cylinder below represents the TOTALITY of accessible web sites that 
could be of interest to you -in the context of your current search. The small 
rings depict four different specific <SPAN STYLE="color: black; background: yellow">clusters</span> of interesting sites. 
<br>Please remember that <u>inside</u> the cylinder the 'void' is only APPARENT! 
That's the part 
of the internet you cannot reach through the main search engines. There are interesting sites 
there as well (as a matter of fact MUCH more than on the 'accessible' outside), but to grab them you'll have to use 
more advanced techniques than commercial engines&nbsp;:-)
<br><br>
<IMG SRC="images/synecd2.jpg"  
ALT="latilongi" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH="402" HEIGHT="441" BORDER="0" VSPACE=0 HSPACE=0>
<br>

<b>1</b>&nbsp;You land first time to an interesting cluster of sites trough your 'clean cut'<br>
<b>2</b>&nbsp;You have 'synecdochically' moved horizontally, modifying your original clean-cut<br>
<b>3</b>&nbsp;These sites will be relatively easy to find, they are both on an horizontal and on a 
vertical synecdoche. Note that the signal width of the vertical synecdoches 
(e.g. the yellow one on the right side of the image) may vary quite a lot, 
while horizontal synecdoches' width seems more costant.<br>
<b>4</b>&nbsp;You'll never find this cluster 
with your current synecdochical approaches, you'll have to 
devise a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT cut.

<a href="http://www.rikai.com/perl/Home.pl">http://www.rikai.com/perl/Home.pl</a>
<br>Try it for instance onto http://www.shirofan.com/ See? It   "massages" WWW pages and
 places "popup translations" from the EDICT database behind the Japanese text!
<br><br>

for instance<br>
http://www.rikai.com/perl/LangMediator.En.pl?mediate_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.shirofan.com%2F

<br>See?<br>
   You can use this tool to "guess" the meaning of many a japanese page or -and especially- japanese search engine options, 
   even if you do not know Japanese :-)<br>
   You can easily understand how, in this way, you can -with the proper tools- explore the wealth of results that the 
   japanese, chinese, korean... you name them... search engines may (and probably will) give you.

<br><font size=+2>Ode to the seekers</font><br></center>
<br><font size=+1>

Like a skilled native, the able seeker has become <font color=blue>part of the web</font>. He knows the smell of 
his forest: the foul-smelling  mud of the popups, the slime of 
a rotting commercial javascript. He knows the sounds of the web: the gentle rustling of the <font color=blue>jpg</font>s,  
the cries of the brightly colored 
<font color=blue>mp3</font>s that chase one another among the trees, singing as they go; 
the dark snuffling of the <font color=blue>m4a</font>s, the mechanical, monotone clincking
 of the huge, blind databases, the pathetic cry of the common user: 
a plaintive cooing that slides from one useless page down to the next until 
it dies away in a sad, little moan. In fact, to all 
those who do not understand it,
today's Internet looks more and more 
like a closed, hostile and terribly boring commercial world.<br>Yet if you 
stop and 
hear attentively, you may be able to hear the seekers, deep into the shadows,  
singing
a lusty chorus of praise to this wonderful world of theirs -- a world that gives them everything they want.<br>
<font color=blue>The web is the habitat of the seeker, and in return for his knowledge and skill 
it satisfies all his needs.</font><br>
<br>The seeker 
does not even need any more to hoard on his hard 
disks whatever he has found: all the various images, 
musics, films, books and whatsnot that he  fetches from the web... 
he can just <font color = blue>taste  and leave  there</font> what he finds, without even copying it, because he knows that nothing 
can disappear any more: 
once anything lands on the web, it will always be 
there, available for the eternity to all those that possess its secret <a href="nomomen.htm">name</a>... <br><br>
<font size=+2>
 <font color=blue>The web-quicksand moves all the time, yet nothing can sink</font>.</font>
 <br><br>
In order to fetch all kinds of delicious fruits,  the seeker just needs to raise his sharp searchstrings.<br><br>
In perfect 
armony with the sourronding internet forest, he can fetch again and again, at will, any  target he fancies, 
 wherever it may have been "hidden". The seeker
  moves unseen among sites and backbones,
using his anonymity skills, his powerful proxomitron shield and his mighty HOST file. <br>
If need be, he can quickly hide among the zombies, mimicking their behaviour and thus disappearing into the mass.



<br><br>
Moving silently along the cornucopial forest of his web, picking his fruits and digging his juwels, 
the seeker avoids easily the many vicious traps that have been set to catch
 all the furry, sad little animals that happily use MSIE (and outlook),  that use only 
 one-word google "searches",
 and that 
browse and chat around all the time without proxies, bouncing against trackers and web-bugs 
and smearing all their personal data around. 
<br><br>
Moreover the seeker is armed: 
his sharp browser will quickly cut to pieces any slimy javascript 
 or rotting advertisement  that the 
commercial beasts may have put on his way. His  bots' jaws will tear apart any database defense, his powerful 
scripts will send 
 perfectly balanced searchstrings  far into the forest.
