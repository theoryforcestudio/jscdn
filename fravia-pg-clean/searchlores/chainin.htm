<hR><font size=+2> Proxomitron and Junkbuster chaining, an important lore</fonT>
<hr width=44%>
<i>There is an interesting short snippet by NME <a href="chainin.htm#below">below</a>, that you'll appreciate 
after having read the following 'teamwork' presented by 'threestars' proxy-cooks Iefaf and Bone Digger (I 
have collected it 
on
my old  <a href="http://www.insidetheweb.com/messageboard/mbs.cgi?acct=mb155985&MyNum=952057226&P=No&TL=952057226">msgbrd</a> 
 in March 2000).<bR>The thread is meant as an answer thread to vgb's question below:</i>
</center><prE>
OK - I've got Proxomitron and Junkbuster configured and running
with apparently no problems. I've gone to a few of the proxy
checking sites and all they get is an IP and my provider. Since
the IP is assigned each time I call in can I assume a *bit* of
anonymity? I'm not paranoid about it but I really don't want
anyone tracking my browsing habits if I can help it.
Would it be overkill if I used proxomitron and junkbuster and then
connected to an external proxy?

Pardon the newbie questions but I've only become concerned with
what I'm sending out lately - my education is sadly lacking.

I've read some FAQ's on proxy's but I don't understand the
distinction between something like virtualave proxy and
proxomitron other than one resides on *my* system.

Thanx for the help,

vgb

<BR>iefaf gave you very good advice. I hope I don't offend him by
following up his response to you. I am only responding because it
appears to me that you have failed to understand that you must
input an open proxy in Proxomitron. Proxomitron is not a proxy in
and of itself. Nor is Junkbuster. They are best thought of as
filters.<BR><BR>To proxy (used as a verb) you must find & then
input in Proxomitron one or more open proxies in the
format<BR><BR>proxyname:port <BR><BR>by selecting Proxy->Add->OK.
Then open the log window and select Test to verify that your proxy
is working and to examine the headers. <BR><BR>When you visit a
test page or any web page for that matter the REMOTE_ADDR ENV
should display the IP number of your newly added open proxy and
not your dynamically assigned (static if you connect by cable) ISP
connection IP number. A proxy acts as a re-performer on your
behalf. One that is commonly referred to as "anonymous" (sometimes
the term "nontransparent" is misused to convey the same concept)
will act on your behalf in retrieving the requested web resource
but will not pass your real IP number (or resolved host name) in
any ENV header. Please note that if you run a server on your
machine to act as a proxy your real IP number will still be passed
unless your requests are sent onward via a second external proxy.
Junkbuster & Proxomitron are often called proxies but they are not
sufficient to protect your privacy BECAUSE THEY RESIDE ON YOUR
LOCAL MACHINE. That is why Proxomitron will filter your headers
(as you have configured it) but then send your request onward to
the external open proxy you have entered and
selected.<BR><BR>External websites that you might find at say
Anonymizer run a proxy server that acts by undefining the
important ENV headers that are passed by you before sending your
request onward. The website from which a resource has been
requested should only see the proxy's IP number (not yours) and
thus respond by sending  the requested resource to the exteral
proxy which will in turn send it onward to you. The proxy again is
simply a re-performer; I might add a re-performer that must
understand the underlying protocol of your request.<BR><BR>I hope
this helps. I apologize to iefaf if I offended by adding my own
two cents.<BR><BR>- Bone Digger<BR><BR><BR><BR>

Iefaf & Bone Digger -

Thanx for the explanation. Combined ( team work ) you gave me what
I needed to understand the difference between a *filter* and a
*proxy*.

Iefaf - one question however - the browser connects to :8000 which
is JB which is forwarded to :8080 which is Prox which uses
external :xxxx.
In your example you indicate browser->Prox->JB->proxyserver->URL.
Is that correct or should it be
Browser->JB->Prox->proxyServer->Url?
                  
Iefaf - Correction - you didn't say to connect JB on :8000,
I read that in another post.
You indicate to connect *browser* to :8080 AND forward JB to
:8080?

Am I misunderstanding or is it a typo?


Thanx again for the help.

<BR><center><font size=+2>Chaining the Proxomitron and
Junkbuster<br></font>(snatched on my messageboard by myself)</center><br>You can reverse the order and have the Proxomitron listen to port
8000, entering your proxy into the Junkbuster's configuration. You 
can thus set your browser's proxy
configuration to localhost:8080 (for HTTP) and have all the
filtering of both the Proxomitron and Junkbuster in effect, while
your browser can be configured for a Security proxy of
localhost:8000 to allow Junkbuster to act as a Security
filter for HTTPS. Since you can more easily
fine tune Junkbuster's ad filtering capacities for the specific sites you 
frequent, you can kill more ads (and more easily) in this way, speeding 
up your browsing. The disadvantage is that Proxomitron's
excellent proxy administration features will be disabled.<BR><BR>
Those that prefer not to chain Junkbuster and
Proxomitron locally, but still wish the advantages of doing so,
can alternatively use the Proxomitron as a local proxy, 
entering the external Junkbuster proxies into its proxy list. For a couple of interesting 
lists see <font color=blue>[</font><a href="pxylist1.txt">pxylist1.txt</a><font color=blue>]</font>
 & <font color=blue>[</font><a href="pxylist2.txt">pxylist2.txt</a><font color=blue>]</font>

<bR>by NME, February 2000<br>    </center>
<br>Proxomitron is not really efficient at blocking a long list of
banner gif URL's. Junkbuster, however, was born for this task.
Download and install Junkbuster. Enter your GIF-kill list in the
sblock.ini file and save. For a good kill list to get you started
you can go to waldherr.org You may see some of the same URL's that
you have, maybe even more.
                       <br><br>
You then have to include Junkbuster in your local proxy chain to
get the benefits of both JB and Proxo. You could set your browser
to proxy to localhost:8000 to forward to JB. In JB's sforward.ini
file enter:           <pre>
*(TAB)localhost:8080(TAB).(TAB).
                              </pre>
except (TAB) should be replaced by actually hitting the tab key. <bR>
JB will now forward to Proxomitron.
