Well... it is very important to use feedback to ameliorate &
change... I believe
 that "awards" are
less important than "critics", since you can better use the latter
to ameliorate your
work and -maybe-
develop... yet some awards are sweet and anyway

Fravia, inspired by among other things the teachings of "the Old Red Cracker", +ORC, created the HCU (the Higher 
Cracking University) and a huge website mirrored in part and full all over the web containing teachings and 
research papers on cracking. The crackers, or reversers as they mostly preferred to be called, involved with 
his pages did not limit themselves to software cracking, they also performed society analysis they called 
"reality cracking" which has close ties to the analysis of "subvertising"; advertising aimed at people's 
unconsciousness. Without a doubt I can say his pages are the most important influence on (at least windows) 
cracking in the latter half of the 1990s. Some time ago he asked that all mirrors of his site be taken down, 
and shifted his focus to his new "searchlores" pages. What is left are many incomplete and discontinued mirrors, 
but still the wealth of knowledge on these pages is immense, although more specific to one and one case than general. 
The link is in fravia's spirit.
Fravia is now busy with his <a target=_top href="http://www.searchlores.org">Searchlores</a>.</i>

Fravia is a leader in the world of computer self-empowerment. If
you have any experience with programming or are just curious about
how things work on the web, you MUST look at this site. His site
used to be all about software reverse engineering, which is how to
look at the raw assembly of a program and modify it so the program
registers itself. Recently, fravia+ has taken his site in a new
direction, focusing on how to find information hidden on the web.
(The reversing essays are still there too, you just have to search
for them :).<br>
Includes priceless essays on everything related to internet self
defence and user empowerment. I only wish i had the skills needed
to join the HCU+...

you won't find any advertisements whatsoever on this site...
The site makes use of Latin verbiage & sparse but interesting

  <a target=_top href="http://www.searchlores.org/">Fravia+'s Searching
Lores</a><br>

Fravia+ may well claim to be one of the first and most prominent
civil rights' activists of the internet, promoting its intelligent
use against insipid commercial abuse. His first page,
www.fravia.net, served the net for almost five years and offered
25+ MB of security related material, including Micro$oft bashing,
Javascript tricks, Anonymity and the famous Academy of Reverse
Engineering. In addition, it transported with charm the radically
anti- commercial spirit which used to prevail in the hackers and
crackers of old, and which is mostly extinct nowadays, as it
seems. Still one of my all-time- favourites, it was, alas,
completely withdrawn from the web. Following the author's express
wish, most of the mirrors closed down as well.
<br><br>
So I offer you Fravia+'s new pages instead, which specialize in
advanced means and methods of searching the internet and grabbing
hold of virtually ANYthing knowable (well, that's what he claims,
at least). It is by far the best in-depth introduction to the less
commonly known aspects of the web that you can get and, on top of
that, it's extremely amusing to watch him stalk some of those
self-declared experts who make use of anonymization techniques and
faked identities just in order to spam shamelessly, play bad
tricks on newbies or initiate undignified flame wars etc.
<br><br>
We need more non-conformists of his like, if we wish to prevent
the web from sharing TV's sad fate!

Well well well, I see we have not been idle :)
<br><br>
The site is well laid out [style sheets ?!? ;) ]. I
see you have not totally
abandoned cracking-style stuff ['other stuff'], but
have moved it far into
the background where it will be unobtrusive. This is,
in my opinion, a good
move ... the cracking nature of the previous site
tended to hold it back
from plunging whole-heartedly in a new direction. It
seemed people thought
you owed them the right to publish their essays on
your site...
<br><br>
Lots of stuff to read, though thankfully you do not
yet have it all written.
I assume you will cover all the archie/ftpsearch/usual
channels, but are you
going to move into the MP3/warez/p0rn world with
discussions of Hotline,
Napster, and other such 'undernet' protocols? They are
proprietary in a
certain sense, but are reversed and re-implemented on
a daily basis. <font color=red>The
reversals themselves --documented in many places, e.g.
with Napster -- would
make excellent advanced lessons</font>. Also,
Perl/Tcl/Java[ugh] -- some perl
examples of ferrets etc would be good to throw into
the intermediate
section. I started a perl search-engine writing
tutorial for Jeff awhile
back ... if you are pressed for content [right! ;) ] I
can finish it. I
think it is still at
<br><a
href="https://searchlores.nickifaulk.com/www.eccentrica.org/Mammon/sprawl/jeff.doc">www.eccentrica.or
g/Mammon/sprawl/jeff.doc</a>
<br>in rough
form. Then there is the whole server-side Javascript
mess, and servlets, and
jhtml, and  Dynamo/JavaApp servers, and DBIs, and ASP
[remember the ? trick?
:) ], and a host of other web-related junk I now have
to deal with at
work...
<br><br>
http://www.searchlores.org/evaluate.htm
I like it :)
<br><br>
http://www.searchlores.org/trolls.htm
...I'll wait for you to finish it
<br><br>
well, enough page-by=page. It looks good. I don't know
if you are planning
to touch on the hacker end of the spectrum, vis-a-vis
host scanning and
such. Check TLC and PSS if you do.
<br><br>
Some tools you may want to check: Biew [a hex editor,
like hiew, for dos and
linux, with source, free], GoVest [a debugger for
win32], and perhaps Qweb
if it is ever finished [supposedly an ISO compiant web
browser]. And I
believe you know already proxyhunter, a win32 tool for
finding proxies.
Perhaps a lesson on using range [multi-IP target] port
scanners to find
proxies would be good. Much easier on unix than
windows, natch, though Perl
enables this to be implemented anywhere.
<br><br>
One more of my back-burner projects is playing with
neural networks for
unconventional applications [specifically, for
decompiling and for
web/archive/file searching]. The idea of a NN or
expert system is that it
can be trained to mimic human decisions -- thus, you
'train' it to mimic
your own decision making process, whether that
decision id whether a webpage
is worth looking at, whether a block of code is a
switch statement or a
while statement, etc.
<br><br>
Knotty is looking into NNets as well for school, so
I'll have to bug him for
info :) But these projects will have to wait until I
am a little more
settled in , and for the linux debugger to get
somewhat functional.

Fravia+,<br>
no, it's rarely important to reply in cases like this e-mail;
consider
it a message-in-a-bottle found on the beach. you may even spit
into it and toss it back ;) <br><br>


firstly: you have quite a beautiful study at searchlores.com, my
compliments.
<br><br>
secondly: and perhaps useful, did you see the (non-technical)
article written
in the Feb. 2000 of Wired (perhaps an awful publication)...
nevertheless the
article may interest you (as a potential line of inquiry).

The world's smartest search engine took 250 years to build.
Autonomy is here.<br>
By Steve Silberman <br><br>

Possible Keywords: Michael Lynch (founder)<br>
Reverand Thomas Bayes (CF Bayes Formula:  Probability) <br>
Autonomy/University of Cambridge ... <br><br>

PS: I was going to try an idea on your old mb, i.e., to speak of
searching
and writing (how
one is limited as you say in their tools), and also how one is
limited by
the problem of
needing a descriptor/description --for example trying to descrive
a texture (or
even to find a few relevent words about it--these to me are most
difficult). <br>
The natural approach to writing seems to be quite similar to the
natural
approach to searching... (at
its most sophisticated)
or perhaps I am muddled.
<br><br>
anyway, i've got to ...

Fravia+,<br>
I am delighted to find your new site and endeavor since searching
became
my first love of the web. As I have time I will try to assemble
some
essays for you or at least pass on useful snippets of info for you
to
use as you see fit.<br><br>
Having found your new site and some reference to the useful
methods of
searching with altavista, I did not see a reference to scooter's
manual
at<br>
<a target=_top href="http://altavista.software.digital.com/docs/search/reference_
manual.pdf">http://altavista.software.digital.com/docs/search/refe
rence_manual.pdf</a>
<br>All serious searchers <font color=red>should</font> obtain and
<font color=red>read this
manual</font>, particularly
those sections on searching the indexes built by scooter since
they
apply to using altavista's public search engine. While much of the
text
is related to using scooter to build indexes and making the
required
settings, quite a bit is about using the search and programming
scooter's API. Those sections of building indexes and programming
will
help some searchers to better understand the spider
itself.<br><br>
One example of the knowledge in searching they will learn is the
variety
of wildcards allowed, ie *, ? and ** While many may be familiar
with the
* which can be used after 3 leading characters to represent up to
5
characters they will also learn they may use the ? with the same
restrictions to represent a single character which will sometimes
help
to filter the results. They will also learn of the double ** which
can
be used to represent an unlimited number of characters instead of
the 5
represented by * alone.<br><br>
Students of the art will also find much more about boolean
queries,
literal searches, ranking, filtering and more. Feel free to use
this
snippet if desired without credit if you wish. Pass along the url
of the
manual directly or test the students to find it if they can. <font
color=red>Perhaps
this url may be given with a challenge to the students to find the
links
of manuals for the other spiders of the web</font> :-)<br>

one</a> . Essentially, a dirty little trick that one such as I
will usually hold no truck with...but, in the case of this fellow,
I think I'll let the half-a-meg wordpile at the bottom of that
page which serves as "the very 'net' (a list of words and
'angles') I have used to fish you out of the web..." What's more,
he even attempts to warn you to hit the stop button and halt its
loading to help you save time and mind-bits.
<br>
<br>The site is called Searchlores and it's a sprawling hodgepodge
of a compendium on search engine magic, lovingly pulled together
by a dilletante of sorts by the name of Fravia . Dilletante, but a
lovable sort of dilletante. Essentially, he's put together
something like a two-semester college course in Finding Neat Stuff
On The Web.
<br>
<br>He is dedicated to the Old Ways of the Net, the sort of place
it was (that I got to see a couple years or so of myself) before
the influx of web economy buzzword-spewing idiots yapping about
"leveraging best-of-breed branding solutions". He steadfastly
refuses to charge fees or have any advertising on his site at all.
Which I am very supportive of, in this disappointing and
disheartening age of ever-increasing fee-requisite content.
<br>
<br>I do find his fanaticism for the Opera browser a little
wearing (from a guy who doesn't like ads, Opera has just about as
many planted in its bookmark files as I would imagine there are in
the AOL web browser) - I use MSIE (most of the time, anyway)
because despite all its other problems it Just Plain Does CSS
Right and this has the effect of Making Pages Look Good. I can
ignore the things about it I dun' like, but bad CSS management in
other browsers is harder for me to ignore.
<br>
<br>I get the feeling Fravia sees the Web as primarily an
information conglomeration. Which it - of course, is . But I also
see the aesthetics of design and information organization in it.
And well, I refuse to entertain the notion that either one of
these things should have to be sacrificed to preserve the
integrity of the other. Mostly, I guess, it's Because That's What
I Do. I write AND design web pages. I am no fan of Microsoft,
though, ESPECIALLY with this blight on the face of the net called
WINDOWS XP that it's unloading on all of us. Frankly, I would
continually choose to use Mozilla and maybe even Opera every so
often if it didn't have just a few aggravating CSS bugs still
mucking up things (justified text, for example, still only looks
good in MSIE 4.* .) Opera also drives me nuts because while a page
is downloading it comes down at 70% of the page size instead of
100%. I have not the slightest idea WHY it does this either, but
it's annoying as hell.
<br>
<br>I am pretty good at ignoring the aspects of the Big
Bloatasaurus Browsers that are no good in favour of the parts of
them that are precious nuggets of goodness. As for the data mining
they always seem to be doing from me, that's a no-brainer: I just
fill up all my data forms with FAKE CRAP anyway so that's all
Micro$shafft's data miners (and all the OTHER data miners) are
getting. Good old "Morgana Gondwanaland" will answer any questions
you have about the Trend Towards Faking Form Data that's Sweeping
the Land. (Aggregate THIS, demographic pigeonholers and "targeted"
merchantizers...)
<br>
<br>Getting back to Searchlores: the site's not all about using
search engines. Nestled within it are globules of Other Things. Of
particular interest to me - and perhaps you - is Reality Cracking,
a super-sub-metaversive collection of tracts on resisting
konsumer-kultura and living a juicy life in spite of its enforced
dryness of mind. It'll take a while to get through this
material...but it's definitely bookmark-worthy.
<br>
<br>I'm also going to grab-and-save the textfile of "capture net
list" of words, as I was looking at them and I dunno if it's just
me and my Weird Brain seeing things that Aren't There, but it
just...seems to me...that these words were specifically chosen for
inclusion in the "net trap" to draw in the adventurous and
intelligent among us. It got me, that it did, so draw your own
conclusions. Maybe this bunch of words will help me forge through
a bout of writer's block sometime.
<br>
<br>Now, I've been webbing since 1995. Surely there's nothing more
I could learn about search engines. But one never knows. I do know
I've been terribly amiss with attention to the META tags of
Involution's pages as of late: even the front door page has...none
at all&#33; Egad&#33;
<br>
<br>Oh blast. I...Must META-stasize&#33;"

<br>
Hello Fravia,<br><br>
 
I thought i'd send you a note to thank you for your site. I have been reading it for many years, from when it was on geocities 
and was moved from place to place and onwards. :)     <br><br>


I used to do some cracking but my real interest has always been the "<a href="realicra/realicra.htm">reality cracking</a>" side of things. I have, after reading your suggestions, 
spent much time learning the techniques of classical rhetoric. Of course I have had to do this privately, since universities are in a state 
of such degeneracy that are neither taught nor understood. :) You might be interested to see <a href="https://searchlores.nickifaulk.com/www.textkit.com">www.textkit.com</a>, 
a site that provides many older (and therefore superior, as you'd say ;) greek and latin textbooks for free. <br>
There is also a decent forum for people learning the immortal languages. 

                 <br><br>
Are you familiar with the writings of Julius Evola, such as Men Among the ruins? I feel that you'd find his works interesting, if a 
little too mystical. 

           <br><br>
Anyway, I notice a touch of despair in your discussions of exegesis and reality cracking. Fear not, because many of us are privately and secretly 
studying - and teaching - such things, in spite of the decadence of our educational systems :) 

           <br><br>
By the way, some interesting things are happening politically, especially in france and russia with the rise 
of the right there, and at the same time the rejection of certain destructive forces... any opinions about that? 

 <br><br>
Regards, <br>
Tristan.

Fravia+, <P> I was just now reading your pages when I realized how
beneficial it has
   been to me to re-read the many sections and essays therein.
While each
   initial reading provides tools to take out into the world to
reverse it, (I remember going to the market after reading +ORC's
supermarket
<font color=blue>[</font><a
href="realicra/slaves.htm">essay</a><font color=blue>]</font>,
what a
   scene!) re-reading is even more helpful. <P> Amidst the chaos
of my life, I find bits of knowledge and experience
   coming to light to aid my works at the most opportune moments,
a constant
   mixing of 'now' and experience mingling to provide a path and a
solution.
   Surely I am not alone in this, but new information and
situations often
   obscure or resist reversing by their 'newness'. Just as
listening again to
   a favorite piece of music or re-reading a favorite book or
watching a
   favorite film will place me in a reflective mindset, so does
re-reading
   the essays and tips and tools of our reversing lores. Then a
bit of info
   picked up in a new email or read in the paper suddenly fits
into a puzzle
   I was not aware of on the edge of my mind, and a new
understanding
   happens. &quot;If your life does not seem strange to
you...&quot; A constant stream
   of reversing matters present and re-present opportunities to
understand
   and learn. <P> I think you too realize this, and re-read things
almost unconsciously as a
   linguist, and of course as a wanderer in the codewoods. Yet
perhaps this
   intuition is so deep you have not mentioned it 'out loud' so
often in your
   writings. Of course the 'lores' pages are quite back to a state
of '<font color=blue>you'll
   never be able to count them all</font>' or maybe it's been
staring me down
   through my electron gun the whole time :) but I think it's
<font color=red>easy to
   underestimate reviewing and re-reading as valuable
practices</font>, <P>
A most important 'tip' for beginners and ~S~ alike: <P> <font
color=red>Read, comprehend,
   go away and live,
   then re-read and know</font>. <P>
   wisdom and life
   met on the road

Fravia+,<bR>I saw your searchlores site and it is wonderful!<br>
It fills a much-needed gap, you know the web passed
the 1 billion mark a few months ago, according to news
reports, although how this figure was arrived at is
anybody's guess. you may remember it had already been
established by the same News Lords some time before
that the search engines only have a fraction of it in
their databases. (altavista was the winner, with 16%,
<font color=red>but that was before they got bought, changed their
algorithm, and apparently discarded 60 or 70% of
whatever they did have</font>).<bR><bR>

It is enlightening and frightening to see search
techniques so all grown up and quantified. I continue
to rely on the tried and true psi tracking factor, and
plain old fashioned Voodoo; I believe the latter is
used extensively by the search engines themselves.
<bR>

<br>
If I had any money I would come to Europe tomorrow. I
am becoming less optimistic about the US as an
appropriate home for people who do not see Rwanda as
the societal ideal to which we all should aspire.
<bR><bR>
On behalf of earth, thank you for existing and sharing
yourself.

Hi  Readers...<br>  ...our research task
is
daunting. I thought that you would be interested in the website,
searchlores by
Fravia.  The site will inform and amuse you about the World Wide
Web.<br>
It
includes beautiful illustrations along with in depth articles.
It's an
intelligent and sophisticated approach to searching the web.  I've
learned
so much... from researching, surfing, cookies, to reading headers
<font color=red>and
some
pitfalls to avoid when meeting folks from the underbelly of
cyberspace</font>.<br>
One warning though...you will be glued to your computer.
<br>
 The URL is: http://www.searchlores.org So who is this "guy"?
 In cyberspace sometimes you never know. Fravia
is
Finnish, lectures in many languages, is witty...exudes lots of
savoir
faire... And knows his stuff.  If you click on the URL below, it
features
some of his recent lectures. Am I a fan? You bet.
I pass on his name and knowledge to you.

<hr width=44% align=left>
<br>
Author's Note: Obviously, much of the text, syntax, 
and gramatical structure you'll find here is borrowed from Searchlores.
<br> 
My thanks goes to Fravia+ for providing such a wonderful resource.
<br> 
For this assignment, I used The Yoyo Wand, a lesser known searching 
tool and not an engine in its own right. I asked it to querry Google 
with the string <a href="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=%2B%22search+engines%22+%2B%22how+to+search%22&num=50&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&btnG=Google+Search&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&lr=&as_ft=i&as_filetype=&as_qdr=all&as_occt=any&as_dt=i&as_sitesearch=&safe=images">+"search engines" +"how to search"</a>. 
<br>
These are the results:<br> 
Search Engine Watch came first, which is not surprising in the least, 
since the golden rule still applies to the commercialized corners of the Web. 
A Searchlores reference did not come up until link number 257, which I 
found slightly odd as I had structured my querry with the idea of targeting 
Fravia+'s pages. Still, three of Fravia's pages appeared at links 257, 
752, and 761. Of these, I found number 761, Hints & Tips, to be the most useful. 
Fravia+'s sixteen points, while not a primer on web searching per se, are useful 
for those who have already searched Altavista and are looking for better results. 
His page loads quickly and cleanly, is easy to navigate, and it's printer friendly 
too. 
<br>
Search Engine Watch on the other paw, is a commercialized bastardization that 
makes me more than greatful for The Proxomitron and Junkbuster. The headlines 
and articles on the left side of Search Engine Watch caught my eye, but I soon 
realized that I'd seen that same information before on Ebenezer's, and it 
didn't have ads attached. 
<br><br><u>Of interesting note</u> is that a search for 
"searchlores", "fravia", or "yoyo" on the Search Engine Watch site wide 
search engine turned up nothing.

 Searchlores: Way more than you'll ever need to know for finding common information like what we want. But the "Basics" section is still very useful. 
 <br>Advanced topics will allow you to find on the Internet things that you wouldn't think are on the Net, or things that shouldn't be on the Net, or even things that aren't legally publicly accessible on the Net. 
Pretty anti-consumerism, anti-commercial, anti-corporate; and the webmaster tends to think of himself as something of a guru sometimes (himself still a student of his own "guru" though), so he can get a little cocky sometimes. 
<br>Also goes into things like "reality cracking", anonymity, reverse-engineering if you're interested. 
This webmaster's views have somewhat shaped my own, since his reverse-engineering site (now down) was one of my earliest web obsessions... 1997 or so?

Yesterday I managed to get sucked into a 'search trap': a page
packed with thousands
of keywords designed to draw in users searching for other things.
Normally,
I think the technique stinks, as it dilutes the usefulness of
search engines,
and sites that use it tend to be garbage anyway. However, this one
led to Fravia's
<b>Web Searchlores</b> (Advanced Internet searching strategies &
advices), which is packed
with interesting stuff. Despite a tendency to lapse into
Tolkienesque metaphor -
can't people just admit they're computer techies, not elven
warriors? - Searchlores
contains high-quality guidance on how to use the Web to find what
you want.
A particular gem is a new search engine, WebTop.com, that I'd
never encountered.
     Furthermore, along with hacking stuff that doesn't interest
me, there's a
lot of intelligent material about 'Reality Cracking', which takes
the premise
that if you can understand, crack and subvert computer code, you
can do the
same with the codes that underly culture, such as body language,
the symbols of
advertising, marketing propaganda, newspaper bias, and so on.
(This is arguably
memetics - see below - in another guise). It also covers exegesis
('text-cracking'):
an important skill, when the Internet contains as much
misinformation as information.
Searchlore gives valuable tips on how to raise your critical level
above the level
of being hoaxed, to the point where you can use the medium of the
hoax to a purpose.

+ORC was a genius, and I am sure he will appear on history books soon or later.
I owe him (and fravia+) more than one: my job among many other thingsâ¦

Fravia is a legend, but his site is consciously designed not to give up 
its deepest secrets without the reader putting some effort into it. Ironic considering it's mostly about searching.

Dear Mr. Fravia.

   I have been pouring over your site ever since I stumbled upon it
very, very early in the morning two days ago. I am amazed at what you
have created, and have helped others to create! Your website is a forum
for some of the most interesting discussions (about programming,
politics, ethics, life, language, etc) that I have seen in a while. I am
literally blown away.

   I had always considered myself quite the master of the "little black
box", but now I see that I know nothing. Thank you for publishing this
website. This is the most useful place I've ever been on the internet.

   Please don't ever give this up! We really need people like you out
there. I have a sad feeling that there are not nearly enough... I think
I know what I want to do when I grow up!

Well fravia+,<br>
in the off chance that you still recall "who" i am i feel it
necessary to write (also it has been a long
time). The recent events have pressed hard on my mind - and i feel
your words more than ever. <br>As the
media giant looms i can hardly deny anymore that it will (has!)
conquered humanity and bled the minds
out of our friends and family. There is no longer any doubt that
the media's tactics render familiar
minds confused and barren. <br>I see it even now around me - and
it is
simply horrible. sometimes i feel it
is better to forget all.<br>
I write also (since i will inevitably fail to make it a public) -
i am flying off on a holyday which may
be permanent. <br>It seems appropriate to address a few words to a
you, a web presence i have "followed" for
many years now (hard to believe that i was a child, more or less,
when i first found myself transported
into your labyrinths via Escher ;)<br> I simply wish to extend my
feelings: i have admired your work and it
has for me (and countless others) been a wind of freedom
ordinarily so difficult to believe in these
days. <br>I want to say; however i may have spoken in the past and
in
various quarters, i consider the last
sentiment to be the worthiest. <br>And i say with certainty that
however much my weaknesses courted
insanity, and however much indignation has brought my talents to
necessary ruin: i can still recognize
beauties, i can never be indifferent to beauties. And to that end
i will bid you a farewell.<br> One day,
who knows? Even these hardships will be grand things to look back
on. ;)<br></font>
kuririn.
