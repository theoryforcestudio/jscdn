<hr width=44%>Slightly edited by fravia+<hr width=44%><i>This trick is useful 
when you are captured inside all those 
horrible (and vulgar) "Pandora-boxes" commercial warez and porn sites that 
spring a thousand silly 
windows out and lure you with false "enter here" links onto entering other 
- similarly useless - sites. The ratio signal to noise of such sites 
is next to zilch and therefore you should never approach them in the 
first time - whatever kind of warez or even porn you may be looking for.<bR>Let's not forget, also, that seekers travelling

and  moreover <u>without</u> <font color=blue>any active java or javascript</font> inside their browser wont need these instructions that badly... 
and yet what is explained here could come quite handy for every 
seeker... Thanks Rumsteack! Let's hope to have more feedback on this by 
whoever will research further into it.</I>

<br><Font size=+3>GetRight lores</font><br><br>


Fravia+,<bR> please keep in mind   that english is NOT my native
language -  I'm very pleased you
made an   entire new site on this subject. It gives me courage
to use my keyboard (I'm   a win-mouse user)... <P>    So,
what will I talk about ? I've read all the searching section of
your old   site (or - at least - all the "public" pages) and I realised
  that you like bots. Bot-mailing, bot-constructing,
bot-reversing (!!), bot-everything. So, I'm going to talk
about a bot,
and to be more   precise, a multi-fonction bot (yeah, they are
like all things in life, they   become
multifunctional... bot-wars).<br>This "bot" is GetRight. <P> You
surely have heard about it. Its MAIN function is to allow the user
to   resume broken downloads and to download files from  
different servers at a time. There are other programs like it, but
I only   use this one since I find it useful for download purposes 
(and as we will see, for other things as well).
  
<bR>Nevertheless,
since you seem to dislike  &quot;online downloading&quot;
(and prefer accmail style mail-bots), I've shorten the 
parts which deal with the   "simple" 
retrival of files.<P><hr width=44%><bR>So.. 
<font color=blue>[</font><a href="http://www.getright.com/">Getright</a><font color=blue>]</font>... 
How can this program
help us when searching upstream the wild deep web? In several ways :   site-mapping, pop-ups
avoiding, links-visualising,   HTML source exploitation,
anonimity (this point should be further cleared),   and so on....
  It's for these reasons that I think Getright is a magnificent
tool for any   searcher : it keeps us concentrate on what we're
searching. <P> Now, it's explanation time ! <P> The primary use of
Getright is, as previously said, to help downloading   files.
Imagine, you're surfing (what an horrible "lazy" term! We are SEARCHING!)   and you
discover a useful program called Winzip (I'll explain later why I
  choose this one..But when I say later, that's later. I mean,
  in another short essay of mine, provided that you find this one useful). You
download it   online (this would not happen with a mailbot, of course, but 
let's keep along my online downloading example for this paper) and Bam!,
  connection is resetted... After 3 or 4 times, you begin -rightly- to
become a little   upset. So... you fetch and run Getright. So far, 
so good, now, when you
click on   the link of the download, the program takes control of the the
download itself, and starts doing what it has been
created for... downloading (duh)  and resuming when disconnected. Woah! 
Useful! But Getright <font color=blue>can do many   other things</font>. 
It's sad to
constate that many searchers don't   even know the existence of these
other functionalities (which are <font color=blue>far more impressive</font>   
IMHO than the simple download functions of this "bot"). <P> So, we
have arrived to the real utility of this beast. Let's take a first
  example. A common guy is seeking for a warez prog, or a  
mp3, or an image,or  a zip, anything you may be looking for, 
this is of no importance, but
I prefer to choose   a warez for this paper in order 
to demonstrate the useful <font color=blue>anti-advertisement  
function</font> of Getright, since warez sites are INFESTED with useless 
advertisement (these people not only steal software, but make also 
money out of this theft). After a search, this poor fellow comes to a site :   
<A HREF="http://www.supermegagigawarez.com"><FONT
COLOR="BLUE">http://www.supermegagigawarez.com</FONT></A>  (I hope
this does not exist irl, since I just   imagined it !). This site is his
last hope, cause all other links were dead...   So, he opens the
site full of hope and... Aaaarggg ! 5 windows have   opened, &quot;Vote for
me&quot; links everywhere. When he closes one window, 10 more spring up: 
A Pandora box site!... And when he want to progress in the site,   looking for
what he was searching, he doesn't find any entrance, click this, enter that... 
all the ususal bogus cram . After some  
time, he's discouraged. <P> Now, imagine that a Getright master (you yourself after 
having read this, eheh) is making the
same research. When he sees the name of   the site (names, once
more the importance of   the names, as always), he thinks &quot;Hum, a
commercial site, which is going to eat my   system
resources...Getright, where are you? I command you: <font color=blue>go and fetch</font>!&quot;.Once   launched, he
passes the URL in Getright to download. But, download what ?  
There's no file to download ! Well, this little bot   behaved
hisself quite well : he obeys to the standard rules. So, it's
going   to download the &quot;index.htm&quot; file of the
targeted   site. Once downloaded, the GetRight Browser Windows
opens, and our searcher   sees ALL the links of the page in
this windows !!! With the   knowledge he has of the file he
wants (superprogram.zip), which is a warez   one, he just has
to look at the links on the   browser window, and he gets it...
  For example, I've tried this on a warez site, and the
directory structure   was something like that :  
/warez/appz/downloadz/warez/filez/linkz. How could a human being
finds his   way up to this mess (a part from zen? :-)<P> We have approached here
the <u>site-mapping utility</u> of Getright. Now imagine   something else.
If a site is a terrible mess (like, with   no offense, Fravia's old
one)..The webmaster is likely to -ahem- &quot;forget&quot; link
  to some pages he doesn't want all people to be able   to
see...With Getright, we can use these errors for our purposes :
the links   appear immediatly.. This is similar to the agora
  command -l, but much more powerful I think. And this is also
similar to the   &quot;View Source&quot; command, but,
personnaly, I don't   like to read  sources in order to fetch
links when my bot can do it... Getright   is therefore also a
<u>link-viewing bot</u>.   We have also approached the
anti-advertising utility of Getright... Given   that we don't
see any crap-page at all (only the links), 
it means no ads, no pop-ups,   no banners, no
windows, no sounds, no musics, <u>NOTHING but the links</u>. Our 
holy  
bandwidth is saved...   What else ? The anonimity matters. We
left - I believe, but corrections would be welcome - almost no traces 
with Getright: We accept no   cookies, we leave no history behind,
we don't use    cache. Is it another possible form of "Safe browsing" ? 
There's just the IP
problem, but with a proxy it can be solved. Please  tell me if I am
making a mistake with this assumption. 
<P> But it's not finished yet. There's one
more functionality I want to talk   about. The &quot;Process
Web Page File&quot; option. With   Getright, you could easily
find the links you want on a site. But imagine   once more that
the site is a <u>real</u> unstructured mess.   Dealing with 300 links in the
browser window is not a nice task. So, let's   process the
adresses of the targeted page.   For example, I recently searched
some basic sites dealing with Javascipt   (I'm learning this "branch of ours" 
right now). I
found a really useful site,   with a georgous page with many
download links : .zip, .txt, .htm, .doc.   Nevertheless, I was
only interested in PDF files.   So, I passed the adress of the
site to the &quot;Process&quot; option of Getright. A   new
window opened, with all the links of my site.   But here, we
are no more stuck inside a "site-mapping" logic, we're now in a "download" logic.
  So, there are boxes where you can select which 
files   to download. Of
course, we can select all files of a certain extension :   .pdf
in my case. Then &quot;OK&quot; and that is. With the number  
of links, if I would have sorted them out through ultreadit macros (or, 
even worse, manually), I think I would have
been busy for quite some time. <P>    I think there are many
other possibilities offered by Getright. If I find   new ones,
I'll report them here.   The few that I reported above, are,
IMHO, the most important ones for   searchers. We can  - at least!-
concentrate on the files we are looking for (when seeking files, that is). 
We are   no more disturbed by thousand irrelevant 
other things. <P> I hope this little essay can teach 
something to other readers.   Take it as my first re-pay for what fravia's site has
learned to me (and continues   to teach, as I continue to learn). 
<P> I hope I'll read   more and more from 
you soon. <P>    Rumsteack from France <P>
