<font color="#191970">Dear fravia,
Do you remember coming to Ravensbourne college in South London last year? I was among the
students you talked to in ilab1. Having spent a lot of time reading various things on <a href="http://www.fravia.net">fravia.net</a>,
(still not enough) I have a few questions. I am writing my dissertation on 'Freedom On The Web'
and any reply would be greatly appreciated.
<pre>"knowledge is now free at last, everything should be free from now on, enjoy knowledge and life
and work for everybody else" +ORC</pre>
Is knowledge free? How do I pay for my hardware on which to exchange this knowledge?
</font><hr width=33% align=left>
Yep, knowledge is now free at last. Image being an university student in Tanzania, say, instead of
London. The hardware question is irrelevant. Hardware will be there and you will be potentially
able to access THE SAME degree of knowledge of a student in New York, Berlin or London.
Knowing how to search is another matter of course, but there is no reason to believe that the
fellow students in New York, Berlin etcetera know more than you in Tanzania :-)<br>
So, for the first time in the history of humankind, your location is irrelevant. The only important
thing is what you know, and what you do with your knowledge.
Hardware paying? C'mon, be serious. Hardware is de facto free.
A old 486 or pentium 1 with a good linux distro will cost any jobless moron less than a 12-pack
beer box, if ever.<br>
And who said you need a pentium 4 to find good knowledge?
<br>
<bR> <bR>
<font color="#191970">I had some other questions, but then I found the answers on your site. I'm supposed to get
primary research, but with good searching technique. web or traditional texts, it seems there is
no question that cannot be answered.</font><hr width=33% align=left>
True. Many people do not realize it, though. For the kick of it, try doing those 'competitions' they
publish on some newspapers/magazines: what is this mysterious object? Who said this? And so
on... you know how to search and you'll find those answers in three seconds flat... and get a lot of
fountain pens and other gadgets and assorted crap for free :-)

<br>
 <br><br>
<font color="#191970">But is your approach to information a consequence of being a linguist, being used to conducting
research within texts? 

</font><hr width=33% align=left> I have been teached, for more than 13 years, exegesis of early middle ages sources :-)


<br>
<br><br>
<font color="#191970">Or to put it onto the form of a criticism, what about the unrepresented data of human

interactions that doesn't make it to the web? Why worry about information and power structures
and so on when they are only the inevitable transformations of symbols? When do we step away
from our screens, or books, and make a difference?</font>
<hr width=33% align=left>
We make a difference -mostly- exactly because we DO NOT step away from our books or screens
so much. Our books and screens are connected with the whole planet. The nice guy distributing
leaflets in the street -may he triumph- wont get the attention of more than 20 local zombies.<br>
You can change (small) portions of the world, like a snow ball that will be avalanche, only if you
find the right slopes.
 <br>
<br><br>
<font color="#191970">I agree that there is a need to protect our privacy, but you can never be totally private or totally
anonymous. When striving to protect your privacy do you not make yourself suspicious to
another set of snoopers who have better tools, better tracking devices, more resources?</font><hr width=33% align=left>
  Yes of course. So what? They do not invent resources, they just use what we produce. Moreover,
many of "them" do and did join us when understanding took control of their reflexes. We have
some competitive advantages, like vampires infecting non vampires, do not ever forget it.
 <br><br><br>
<font color="#191970">So is it worth making yourself an enemy on the battleground of information gatherers? What are
we trying to hide?</font><hr width=33% align=left>
An alternative society, a very delicate concoction, should be handled with care when still in its
infancy.
