<br>  
<br>I. A Brief History of the eBook Scene. 
<br>  
<br>This is in no way complete or authoritative, nor does it pretend to be.  
<br>In fact, we would like this to be used as a springboard by others in the 
<br>creation of an official eBook scene history. Our apologies to any groups  
<br>if you were left out or if the dates were incorrectly referenced, we tried  
<br>our best with limited deep dupecheck resources :-) 
<br>  
<br>This history focuses on the Ebook scene, thus ignoring 'bookware' or other  
<br>knowledgeware, usually grouped into the apps/iso scene. This will also not  
<br>include certification, comics, etc. Just eBooks and Mags :-) 
<br>  
<br>Late 90's: The independent ebook 'scene', existing on certain IRC channels  
<br>and newsgroups, 'sprung up' in the late 90's with what became hundreds of  
<br>various books, with an emphasis on fiction (particularly sci-fi), and the  
<br>scanning thereof. While not released officially in the 'scene' as we know it,  
<br>these networks continue to blossom to this day, with many fine books that  
<br>unfortunately go overlooked, or are even snubbed by some in the 'scene.'  
<br>  
<br>2000: The earliest ebook release we could scrounge up was ActiveX and VBS 
<br>Web Workshop by JGT from February (however, we believe there may have been  
<br>some official releases as early as '99). And so began (however unknowingly)  
<br>the eBook scene saga.  
<br>  
<br>2001: The eBook waters remain calm, with only JGT forging bravely ahead,  
<br>with many-a-IT release. 
<br>  
<br>2002: In March ROR begins releasing IT books. Two months later EEn joins the  
<br>fray for knowledge, becoming the first group to release magazines and non-IT  
<br>literature. Various 'one-shot', unfortunately shortlived groups such as OXiDE  
<br>also begin sporadically releasing ebooks. A hint of things to come in the  
<br>following years. 
<br>  
<br>2003: LiBrary is Here&#33; LiB arrives in April and instantly begins releasing  
<br>absurdly large amounts of IT literature :-P Various other short-lived groups  
<br>(LM, META, and so forth) also begin increasing in numbers, once again  
<br>foreshadowing the following year. (Groups with a focus in other areas, also  
<br>begin trying the waters of the eBook scene, EAT, and so forth :-)  In late '03,  
<br>DEMENTiA appears with some awesome magazine & comic scans, and eventually eBooks ;- 
<br>  
<br>2004: In January DDU appears, with the amounts of IT releases rivaling LiB. By now, 
<br>the eBook scene has reached at least some maturity, with five full-time English     
<br>groups (JGT, EEn, LiB, DEMENTiA, & DDU) working hard to bring a cornucopia of ebook 
<br>  to the scene. More groups pop-up devoted to periodical distribution, including  
<br>iNFOSEC, NEWSTAND, iNTENSiTY, and so forth. Towards the late first quarter of '04,  
<br>DEMENTiA unfortunately retires, and a sprinkling of groups with sub par releases  
<br>appear: bibliophile immediately come to mind. Deciding to exploit the title appenda 
<br>of '.eBook' these morons begin releasing individual articles marked as ebooks, and  
<br>engage in other such douchebaggery. However, with more and more sites accepting eBo 
<br>  (even though a large number still only accept IT material--you idiots) the eBook  
<br>scene continues to grow, and online book mills begin adding 'due to apparent copyri 
<br>violations we've been forced to change policy' notices to their databases :-P. In l 
<br>August, EEn takes an indefinite hiatus from the scene, wishing everyone out there l 
<br>and with nothing but gerontological optimism for the future :-)  
<br>  
<br>II. Notes to Groups & Thanks: 
<br>  
<br>JGT: Thanks for introducing ebooks into the scene. You guys were the  
<br>  first ones to release ebooks. You paved the way for all of us to come :-) 
<br>  
<br>DDU/LiB/CAUDEX/ROR: Thanks for your millions of IT books :-D, we're sure an  
<br>  exuberant amount of folk have benefited.  
<br>  
<br>DEMENTiA: Thanks for your kickass variety&#33; Who else can release  
<br>  Harold.Schechter.The.Serial.Killer.Files.The.Worlds.Most.Terrifying.Murderers.200 
<br>  ;-) Terrific stuff&#33; 
<br>  
<br>MEDiSO: Thanks for bringing something completely original to the scene. You're the  
<br>  perfect example of what's needed more in the scene: KNOWLEDGEware. Never stop  
<br>  what you're doing, and don't get discouraged from dumbfuck nukers/siteops who  
<br>  think they have the fucking right to control the flow of information. 
<br>  
<br>Bibliophile: Thanks for embarrassing yourselves with your shitass article rips  
<br>  posin' as ebooks, your weak zno releases, dupes, or any of your other shit.  
<br>  The '.eBook' tag is a privilege not a right. May mighty Cthulhu smite thee,  
<br>  you foul sheep-stomach byproducts. Fuck off and die.  
<br>  
<br>Nukers: And to all the sites that nuked our releases: what the fuck are you  
<br>  cunts doing? Who the fuck are to say what's acceptable and what's not? What,  
<br>  'cause most of our material wasn't IT related, or a few years old it's  
<br>  suddenly not good enough? Fuck off and die. 
<br>  
<br>Suppliers: Thanks for all your hard work, especially the scanners/coders, ya'll  
<br>  know who ya are, no names, no names :-P 
<br>  
<br>Affils: Thanks for taking a chance with us, and helping to spread information.  
<br>  To all sites that accept knowledge: you keep the essence of free information  
<br>  alive&#33;  
<br>  
<br>Fans & Moral Supporters: Thank /you/ for all your thanks :-), your kind words  
<br>  have always kept our spirits up.  
<br>  
<br>Everyone Else: Thanks to everyone else who has ever released quality KNOWLEDGEware&#33; 
<br>  Too many to mention :-) 
<br>  
<br>III. Reflections 
<br>  
<br>What a long, strange trip it's been.  We like to think we've come a long way 
<br>since we first started back in 2002.  Truly it's been very good to see so 
<br>much interest in the ebook scene as of late.  Sadly, we as a group have come 
<br>to the mutal conclusion that we can no longer continue to provide ebooks 
<br>to the scene.  We hope that our releases have inspired others to follow in 
<br>our footsteps.  Looking back it's been an interesting 2 years.  If we've 
<br>provided just one person somewhere with knowledge they used to become a  
<br>better person, then we like to think our work is done.  Hopefully we've 
<br>done a lot more.   
<br>  
<br>Shortly after our debut release in 2002 we discovered many sites didn't 
<br>want us because we were doing non-IT releases.  It was us, you see, that 
<br>introduced magazine piracy to the scene (search waxy.org for EEn). We 
<br>also introduced non-IT books into the mainstream scene.  Early on there 
<br>were a few affils who were willing to take a chance on us, and we sincerely      
<br>thank them.  We became the spurn spores that grew on the scene.  No one 
<br>else was, or /is/ for that matter, providing you with releases such as 
<br>Thornhill.and.Palmer.A.Natural.History.of.Rape.eBook-EEn, 
<br>Coryell.Jazz.Guitar.Creative.Comping.Soloing.and.Improv.eBook-EEn, 
<br>or Dark.Object.The.Worlds.Only.Documented.UFO.Crash.eBook-EEn.  Non-IT 
<br>releases were simply non-existant. 
<br>  
<br>We'll no doubt be lurking in the dark corners of the internet, 
<br>scouring the its depths for ebooks, and when we do, we expect to find some good 
<br>ones&#33;  
<br>  
<br>  * We were like a fungi growing on the scene; unwanted by mainstream siteops, 
<br>    but beloved by the witchdoctors, yay those superstitions peasants with faith, 
<br>    untamed and freespirted as the winds of gentle Lemuria. For the fungi that grow 
<br>    on the land are beneficial, with many a breed posessing hallucinogenic properti 
<br>  
<br>Iv. Recommendations for Scene Rules 
<br>  
<br>One of the pitfalls of the eBook scene is it's lack 
<br>of standardization.  Nukers don't know what's acceptable 
<br>and what's not.  Moreover, book groups seem to think 
<br>they can get away with whatever they want.  EEn 
<br>has tried to live up to it's own (high) quality 
<br>standards, so of course we were upset time and time 
<br>again when we saw groups releasing poor quality rips. 
<br>  
<br>With that in mind we would like to propose some  
<br>rules for future book release groups.  We hope 
<br>the scene takes our recommendations to heart. 
<br>  
<br>  1. 0-day packing rules apply, 1.44mb, 3.00mb, 
<br>     5.00mb, 15mb disk sizes. 
<br>  
<br>  2. No freeware unless marked as FREE.READ.NFO with 
<br>     an explanation as to why you're releasing freeware. 
<br>     Presstexts, press books (see www.movieweb.com),  
<br>     and books that are no longer under copyright (e.g.  
<br>     Kama Sutra) are all considered freeware. 
<br>  
<br>  3. No incomplete journal articles. 
<br>  
<br>  4. No max eBook size. 
<br>  
<br>  5. Publisher.Author.Title.eBook-GRP and Publisher.Title.eBook-GRP 
<br>     are usually too long.  We recommend Title.eBook-GRP as a  
<br>     naming convention. 
<br>  
<br>  6. Publication date doesn't matter, as long as it doesn't conflict 
<br>     with (2).  
<br>  
<br>V. Complete Release History 
<br>  
<br>This is the only official EEn release history. It's taken directly from 
<br>our archives, which we've been keeping since day one.
