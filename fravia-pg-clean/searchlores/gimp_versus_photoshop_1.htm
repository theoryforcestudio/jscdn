Be warned: since I am not a digital graphic expert, some of the assertions on this section 
need to be taken <i>cum grano salis</i>. But I know how to search, and I can quickly spot, find 
and evaluate data, problems and trends on this web-netherworld of ours. Besides, <a href="http://www.searchlores.org">searchlores</a> 
has always had a rich "pictorial" aspect, and we have an interesting section, and many "challenges",  
about  <a href="images.htm">searching images</a> on the web.
<br> <br>
In fact this could be useful for the many, like me, that try to master  a wondrous piece of software 
like the <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">Gimp</a>, the GNU Image Manipulation Program, in order to avoid 
to be chained to proprietary (and expensive, unless you steal it) software like 
photoshop.
<br>
Note that Gimp exists "<font color="blue">native</font>"  both in windows and 
 in GNU/Linux, while  Photoshop itself can run in GNU/Linux through wine. So your Operating 
 system choice does not limit you to the one or the other. I have used both programs 
 for a long time, but I have only recently realized that, with very few exceptions, you can 
 indeed, 99% of the times, use the Gimp for ALL your graphical needs.<br>
<br>
Photoshop has been used for so long, especially during the prehistoric times, 
when commercial and proprietary software was still roaming the earth, 
that it is hailed around as THE photo-retouching and digital imaging tool <i>par excellence</i>, while 
in fact posessing -for those same "historical" reasons- a clunky and obsolete GUI.
<br><br>
For many people, the Gimp offers all the image manipulation tools they need: 
most of Photoshop's functions are present, and, even more 
important, Gimp's functionalities are being expanded all the time. This is a point 
worth underlining: since free applications (and free operating systems à la <a href="linux.htm">GNU/Linux</a>) 
are being developed continuously, the future <font color="blue">belongs to them</font>, with 
<i>bona pace</i> of the obsolete commercial models.
<br>
It is worth recalling again that <font color="blue">with the exception of features that depend 
on patented algorithms</font>, Gimp is already now 99% on par with Photoshop in capabilities.
<br><br>
This said, the Gimp has indeed some missing features (coz proprietary and patented), 
but it does not matter much, for the reasons explained above: 
<i>if Gimp does not do it already, then there is probably someone coding away furiously 
to make it happen</i>, that's the power of open source. Note also 
that you can nowadays load up  directly in Gimp any Photoshop plugin.
<br><br>

Besides, there are even things that Gimp does already now BETTER than Photoshop: Gimp's ability with retouching 
old photographs is extremely good, its handling of PNG is superior, its new screen 
grabber rocks.
<br><br>

A classical example  of Gimp's shortcomings is the "bit depth problem" (lack of 
bit depths higher than 8-bit). Altough you can use 
the free Gimp fork <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CinePaint">cinepaint</a>, and 
notwithstanding the fact that Gimp itself is now catching up, fact is that there is (yet) 
no CMYK support in Gimp, only RGB.<br>
This topic is more important for DTP professionals than for other users (photographers, web artists, home users) 
<font color="blue">because the graphics for print need to be delivered in TIFF CMYK format</font>.
Still, the lack of CMYK support in Gimp does indeed mean that 
for SOME (few) users, Photoshop remains a <i>sine qua non</i>.
<br>Note that the Gimp has already a "<a href="http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/CMYK_support_in_The_GIMP#CMYK_color_and_The_GIMP">separate</a> 
plugin that allows some CMYK work to be done. Also 
the current revitalization of GEGL is a big step forward... maybe Gimp 2.6 or 3.0 will have CMYK and 
spot colors.
<br><br>
<center><table border="0" width=93%><tr><td><font size=+1>In short, if we would attempt a (rather useless) 
comparison: the 
<font color="blue">Gimp would win in web graphics</font>, because it's born for the web: more effective compression, higher quality, 
more web related operations.<br>
<font color="blue">Photoshop would win in big pictures management</font>: its ad hoc 
algos are 10 times faster, as you notice 
when using -say- a 50,000*20,000 pixels image, and its CMYK support is intended 
for high end "gigantic" paper publishing.<br>
Conclusion: They are  not quite comparable, because of their different targets. In other words: 
<font color="blue">The Gimp will do everything outside of commercial printing. 
 If you're not producing 
a print publication... use the Gimp. Unless you want to pirate software, 
there is no reason to use Photoshop.</font>.
</font></td></tr></table></center>

<br><br>
Our aim, here, is to quickly demonstrate to the unwashed some interesting things 
they can accomplish with Gimp.<bR>
Some -almost obvious- warnings for beginners:<br>
You should always work on a copy, 
never on your original image. And it is a good idea to create first of all, 
just in case, a Duplicate Layer.
<br>Note that 
 most file types lose information every time you save them. So avoid saving 
and re-saving in jpg or png. <br> 
If you are not completely done with your image use <font color="blue">.xcf</font> which is 
the Gimp format, that will save all information, including all your layers.<br> 
Save your work as a jpg (or tiff or gif) <b>ONLY</b> when you are finished and ready.

<i>Most photographers use sharpening techiques as the LAST step.
Sharpening will enhance the overall realism. 
Sharpening is a "destructive" process - that is, while it will bring back the realism, 
once sharpening has been performed, there is rarely any way to further modify the image 
with a satisfactory result. 
<br>
Normally, all images, or specific areas within images, need some amount of sharpening due to the 
way a camera dulls the edges of objects during the capture process to 
help avoid moire-patterns or other artifacts. Foliage in particular seems to "pop" to life after 
you've applied a small amount of sharpening yourself.

<center><i>Now that Unsharp Mask has been introduced, we can 
use it with grossly exaggerated values to achieve a favorite effect:  <font color="blue">local contrast</font>  
(that has little to do with sharpening). It can cut down fog, 
haze, smog, and/or provide that "edge" of realism that can give your image 
some 3D look. Used tastefully, 
it is something that can push your images into 
the "man, there's something about your pictures I can't describe that just make them stand out." 
<br>
Applying local contrast is very easy. Just bring up Unsharp Mask Code:
and set the RADIUS value to a ridiculous value of 60 (sixty),  
set the Threshold value to 0 (zero) and 
 change the AMOUNT to anwhere from 0.07 to 0.15 (or maybe a little more) according to your 
tastes.</i></center>

the slices will have a built-in unity of color and texture, allowing
them to work easily together<br>
Up close, an ordinary image is a surprising potpourri of lines, shapes, colors, curves,
corners and edges.<br>
<br>In the example note how you can geometrically relate (or even combine) totally different 
parts of the same image using its 
own colors and textures.

<i>The one reason many are tempted to (pirate and) use photoshop 
instead of the Gimp is that there are a gazillion tutorials and support for photoshop that 
they have not been able to find for its open-source alternative.<br> It is a vicious circle: 
photoshop has a massive user base and for that reason, is far 
easier to find help, addons and support for Adobe's proprietary software than for programs like 
the GIMP.
<br>This is gonna change, because more and more people are now using GNU/Linux and therefore, eo ipso, the GIMP.
<br> 
Let's help: here 
is our small crumb of contribution...</i>
