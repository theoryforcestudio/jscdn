Yep, I have said and repeated that "everything is on the web", but I have always added: 
"somewhere", 
and -as we all know very well- this "somewhere" may at times be 
hard... or next to impossible... to find, alas!<br>
We have decided to 
begin a special section: <u>When your search fails</u>: we hope that it could be of some 
use for the many friends that 'get stuck' during a search. 

As you'll easily realize, 
METHODOLOGY ("qualitative", not "quantitative" nor "haphazardous" seeking) is the alpha 
and omega of searching effectively!<br>If you browse around fluttering like a butterfly, 
instead of clearly CUTTING through the web, you'll never find what you wanted! As stated <a href="toworsh1.htm">elsewhere</a>, you should THINK thoroughly about your 
search approaches and querystrings BEFORE ever shooting a salve of broad simple searches   
on google, like any zombie  - or MBA graduate - would do :-)<br>
<br>Batbin writes: 
"<font color=blue>And others who lose out the search and the battle should get up and admit it. 
Otherwise it's time that is lost most, and time pays.</font>". He's right of course, 
yet, as these 
essays demonstrate, even when he DOES NOT find exactly what he originally wanted, a ~S~eeker
will always 
find ALMOST what he wanted :P)

(but Dejavu ver.3.0.20 is)
<br>by <u>batbin</u>

<font size=+1>

Dear Friends,
<br><br>
I have something to share with you. Though it's most of the times
more than common sense, sometimes people neglect what otherwise
would seem the most natural thing to do (pardon my poor English).
<br><br>
I have found <a href="http://www.searchlores.org">Fravia's site</a> a month ago. Never before on the web
there have been such a detailed account of the ins and outs of
searching (in general) and of things that most people would not
even dream of being done. It deals almost with every aspect of
software engineering, not just reverse cracking but also of the
intricacies of how a software rules our world, and sometimes our
lives. I was delighted, like many of you and sometimes amazed as I
browsed through <a href="http://www.searchlore.org">Fravia's site</a>. There seemed to be an endless
amount of resources available herein.
<br><br>
I have been on the web sometime now, and have found almost
anything that I wanted. It started with a very popular appz that I
was using, and knowing nothing about cracks, etc. (even not
hearing their names), took nearly 7 days to search to find a way
to unlock the appz that I was using. The site that I found to be
most resourceful at that time was <a href="http://www.cracks.am/main.html">cracks.am</a>. Even today most of
the cracks that I need resides there.
<br><br>
The point of all this. Sorry for boring you experts with trivia of
my life thus. I am a translator and my client wanted me to use a
software called Dejavu. It's the dongle dejavu that most of you
have heard of, and it's from www.atril.com. It costs USD900.00. I
will not go through the usual chore of "I don't have the money,"
or "I don't think that I should pay them that much," but will just
say, that I don't want to "buy" the software. "Didn't" want to,
that is (again, sorry for the poor English). Now I searched and
searched and searched. All I could find in the web for Dejavu was
a crack for ver. 3.0.18 and ver. 3.0.21. There was an essay by
+Mad on <a href="http://linux20368.dn.net/fravia/madlas1.htm">how to crack a dongle</a> (you have to be an expert to figure
out what he means). But nowhere that I could find, a crack for
ver. 3.0.26. And now they have the ver. 3.0.28 out, I don't think
anyone cracked it yet. All I had to do was to find ver.3.0.21 and
maybe I could crack it with Amok's code.
<br><br>
Thus I landed to <a href="http://www.fravia.net">+Fravia's site</a>. 
I tried everything that he has
suggested (for searching "Dejavu ver.3.0.21"), as far as I could
afford to understand. Sometimes the language went far beyond my
understanding, and I did not understand things. I went on to try
the next thing. I tried all "Main" search Engines, then "local,"
then "regional". All the underground, and the FTP search engines.
I did find ver. 3.0.20. though, through all this. I tried accmail,
Usenet, MIRC. But of course I skipped some things like "trolling"
"combing". I did not much understand them (yeah, maybe I am a
crack myself).
<br><br>
And I did not want to ask you people, thinking that you might not
have the time to answer (it generally does not work, asking
someone, however politely, to search for something which is
irrelevant for that person).
<br><br>
The lesson that I want to share with all of you, is that if you
need a software very much, and you set yourself searching, first
thing you should do is set a deadline. Say, take about 7 days to
search and search and search. When you have tried everywhere
(especially read <a href="http://www.searchlores.org">+Fravia's website</a>), and you can't find it, give
up the search. <br><br><u>Buy the damn thing, if you require it.</u><br><br> Don't
believe in sayings like, <a href="http://www.searchlores.org/fosdem.htm">it's out there, everything is on the
web</a>". It might be, and most probably is, but it does need someone
smarter than you to get it. Believe me, I have lost a month and a
half, just for that, "it's out there," and I repeatedly did not
admit myself that yeah, it sure is, but I am not the best guy to
get it out of there. It's out there for real cool searchers,
really smart people, not ordinary folks like me. I refused to give
up and give in to the fact that I am an ordinary man (I have found
every software that I needed till now, and my God, I needed a
lot). I refused to believe that it's beyond me. I could not admit
defeat.
<br><br>
I have talked much. Thank you for listening. To Fravia+, you are
great!! You bring in the light, and you open everyone's eyes. But
I think you should tell others too, what I said. Someone has to
wake up and admit that he is unable to find it, and at that time,
they should give it up. "Don't give up" will ruin some of us. I
think you should warn your visitors about that. "Statutory
Warning: If after trying everything here, you don't find what you
are looking for, give up you dumb nutcase. It's out there, but you
have to have more vision to find it."
<br><br>
Please don't think this is an irony, I won't dare. I respect you,
and adore what you are doing. You are a real hero. I just wanted
to share with you this, that I am giving up. I lost. And others
who lose out the search and the battle should get up and admit it.
Otherwise it's time that is lost most, and time pays.

<center><font size=+2>Sound forge ver.6 is not 'out there'</font><br>
(but Sound forge ver.5 is)
<br>by <u>Dza Stalinskouyou Konstitoutsiyou</u>
</center><br><font size=+1>
I think the following could be useful to explain how
complicated even a simple search can be.<br><br>
For reasons that you will understand if you try to identify the
<a href="http://www.searchlores.org/fravia/909.wav">909.wav</a>
file,
like the guys on the ~S~ <a
href="http://fravia.2113.ch/phplab/mbs.php3/mb001?num=1031177711&t
hread=1031177711">messageboard</a>
are <a
href="http://fravia.2113.ch/phplab/mbs.php3/mb001?num=-1&thread=10
29933088#1029933088">trying</a> to do, I wanted to have a
working -complete- copy of Sonic foundry's soundforge.
<br><br>
This appz is a complete
hard disk-based digital sound editor for Windoze, compatible with
any sound card, that allows you to record, edit <u>compare</U> and play
mono or
stereo files, Re-edit songs by looping, reversing, stuttering and
also adding hundreds of more effects.<br>
Note that this is a <a href="malware.htm">spyware</a> appz, and 
will call home to sonic foundry as soon as you install it. (it <u>does not</u> ask, 
it just calls home, as programmed by the wankers at sonic foundry). But I guess that 
if you are reading an essay on this site you'r anyway clever enough to protect 
yourself against these cheap tricks. Sound forge's misbeahviour does not 
matter much. On my copy I have inserted the string '<font color=blue>screw you wankers</font>' and 
it will report -trough a russian proxy- as originating address an IP from nsa.gov :P)
<br>
Anyway: since this program is also useful in order to COMPARE sound
tracks,
I decided I needed it in order to tackle the 909.wav challenge.
Unfortunately it costs more than 400 euro, and I am not ready to
give out such an amount of money for a program that I will only 
use sporadically (I
am
not a music buff, actually I need it only to solve riddles :P)
<br><br>
So, off I go, in search of a soundforge 'free' copy.
<br><br>
Very soon I discovered (september 2002) some facts:
<br><br>
1. Sonic foundry has a version 6 out. This version is free for 30
days, but does not
allow you to save files and has other crippled features. So I need
a complete version.
So I need a crack or a serial to have a complete working version
for free.
<br><br>
2. The cracks for this programs abound <u>for previous
versions</u>, but
are quite rare for version 6 (at the moment, I bet you'll be able
to find tons of keygens 
in a couple of months).
<br><br>
3. The registration system, both for version 6 and 5, is a "two
phases" verification routine:
<br><br>
3.1 You need first of all a valid registration number<br>
3.2 Your computer has a specific ID, that will be taken into
account<br>
3.3 You need as a final step also a verification number, which is in turn based on a
simple algo regnum &lt;-> specific PC-ID<br><br>

As any moron knows, it is easy to find registration numbers on the web. And I quickly 
gathered
a dozen of different registration
numbers, but they wont allow you to unlock this specific software unless you
have also a valid
verification number, <u>which depends on your PC specific  ID
number</u>.
<br><br>
4. Unfortunately I am a poor software reverser myself, and anyway do not
have the time to
examine this software with Softice until I eventually I'll find and disable its 
verification routine. Yet I am,
on the other hand, a fairly good seeker (at least I like to  believe this :P)
<br>So I knew I needed to search for a key generator (not just a
serial number) for such a registration/verification double key protection.
<br><br>

I tried <a href="http://www.openfind.com/cgi-bin/gaisweb.cgi?q=sound+forge+%22version+6%22+keygen&p=1&m=100&g=1&submit=Search">sound forge "version 6" keygen</a>... 
no good.
<br><br>
5. I decided to seek for a previous version (version 5) and to use
one of the many
available keygens (key generators) for this version.
<br><br>
6. So my task is clear: First: find an older sound forge version
5; second, find a keygen for this version.
<br><br>
First of all I tried (wrongly)
<a
href="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=sound+forge+5+download&num
=10&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&btnG=Google+Search&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_e
q=&lr=&as_ft=i&as_filetype=&as_qdr=all&as_occt=any&as_dt=i&as_site
search=&safe=images">http://www.google.com/search?as_q=sound+forge
+5+download&num=10&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&btnG=Google+Search&as_e
pq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&lr=&as_ft=i&as_filetype=&as_qdr=all&as_occt=any&
as_dt=i&as_sitesearch=&safe=images</a>
but i realized that this is a mistake: many "version 5" links
correspond nowadays to the more recent "version 6" that
we could not find a keygen for).
<br><br>
So I tried first 
<a href="http://www.filesearching.com/cgi-bin/s?q=soundforge&t=f&d=&l=en&x=22&y=16">http://www.filesearching.com/cgi-bin/s?q=soundforge&t=f&d=&l=en&x=22&y=16</a>
<br> but here many ftp are offline during the day, so I went, even more
directly to:<br>

<a
href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&as_
qdr=all&q=soundforge5.zip&btnG=Google+Search">http://www.google.co
m/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&as_qdr=all&q=soundforge5.zip&
btnG=Google+Search</a>
only two references -as per today- but Bingo nevertheless :P)
<br><br>
and that was it, a fish 18656 kylobites heavy :P)
<br><br>We still need to crack this baby, though.
<br><br>
Henceforth I went:
<a
href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&as_
qdr=all&q=sound+forge+5+keygen&spell=1">sound forge 5 keygen</a>

<br><br>
So what did I learn?<br><ul><li>
I was not able to find a keygen for version 6</li><li>
I decided to go for the PREVIOUS version, hehe</li><li>
I had to find it, it requires some finetuning of the searches</li><li>
I learned that the mostcommon keygen for version 5 has been made
by 'damn' in june 2001</li><li>
I found it easily.</li><li>
I have now a working copy of sound forge 5 that i can use to (try to)
solve the 909.mp3 riddle (of course I'll delete it as soon as I have solved it, it would be illegal 
to keep it more than 30 days anyway).</li></ul>
<br><br>
All this took me two hours. I still have to solve the 909.wav thinghy, though :*(<br>Thanks for reading these quick notes
