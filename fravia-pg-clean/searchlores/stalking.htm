Enemy tracking, a  difficult art, can be divided into various lore: stalking, <a href="lanpat.htm">reversing 
language patterns</a> and <a href="luring.htm">luring</a>. In order to 
stalk people (especially <a href="http://redwing.hutman.net/~mreed/">messageboards' characters</a>) you  need a 
thorough knowledge of <a href="usenet.htm">Usenet</a> spamming (and war) techniques like flaming, 
<a href="trolls.htm">trolling</a>, avatar mobbing (socketpuppets) and crossposting. 
<br>A good reverser can moreover try to 'reconstruct' (part of) the 
snailtrail of his 
enemies and defeat their smoke curtains  
applying some  semantical reverse engineering tricks.<br>Finally the reverser will 
<a href="luring.htm">lure</a> his targets into the open web and identify them. <a href="http://fravia.2113.ch/phplab/mbs.php3/mb001?num=-1&thread=1070503464#1070503464">Slowbombing</a> them,
or applying <a href="trolls.htm#pingode">other sort of web-attacks</a> may follow.

Identity plays a key role on the web. The Internet offers instant communication with people 
all over the world through a plethora of channels: messageboards, email, chat rooms. In communication, 
which is the primary scope of any web-related activity, knowing the identity of those with
whom you communicate is essential for understanding and evaluating an 
interaction. Yet in the disembodied world of the virtual
community, identity is extremely ambiguous. The recipients are provided  only with 
the information the sender wants them to see. Many of the basic visual and aural 
cues about personality and social role we are accustomed to in the physical
world are absent. And we regularly use exactly such cues -though often not consciounsly aware of it-
 to make attributions.  Other cues are present on the web, yet difficult to interpret. 
 <br>If you receive an email from 
a guy whose address is Bill.Olderson@yahoo.com with an attached image 
of a middle aged man sitting comfortably on the patio of his house, you may be fooled 
into thinking that you have to do with a guy named Bill Olderson. It could be, yet you'll 
never have any real proof of it. One can have, on the web, as many electronic
personas as one has time and energy to create (and memory to recall&nbsp;:-)
<br><br>

Even more complicated pranks are possible on the web. You could create a complete faked university with 
little work. The web is full of  
 <font color=blue>NON EXISTING</font> universities, insitutions, groups and associations. 
You may easily 
 create <i>ex novo</i> a totally bogus university, with nice name, good looking seals, imaginary list of professors.
 <br>Each one of them would of course be you, and yet answer to any inquiry with ad hoc pre-prepared 
 emails: <font color=blue>John W. Krasnjewsky, University of Salsaparilla, Department of Advanced Internet Studies, Dean</font>. 
 <br> 
Just build a "professional website", foresee adequate fees for entrance, courses and examinations, and offer "accredited" MBAs and diploms 
for money (create an "accrediting entity" ad hoc if needs be). 
<br>You think I am kidding? Think again: many people do just that already. 
<br>The web is full of gullible morons, and -what's even worse- the real 
world is full of administrative idiots 
that would trust <a href="http://cio-certification-ccio.net/">such MBAs</a>:  
 ("<font color=blue>Distance Online MBA Certification for who </font>(sic)<font color=blue> are studing a MBA or for who already did </font>(sic)
 <font color=blue> a MBA</font>") in your curriculum vitae. You want a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&as_qdr=all&q=%22mba+online%22+accredited+quick&btnG=Search">MBA for 150 euro</a>?
<br><br>Hence the importance of stalking, also in order to bust pranks and prankers.
<br><br>
Yet, while it is true that a single person can create multiple electronic identities that are
linked only by their common progenitor, that link, almost invisible in the virtual 
world, is of great significance, and can  often be quickly individuated.
<br><br> That is the weak point of any virtual created identity. It's easy 
to say that your avatars should have 'coherent' personalities , i.e. if you create a 'lorry driver' 
personality and a 'university professor' personality, the two should have COMPLETELY different 
<font color=blue>speech patterns</font>, yet this is very difficult to implement. 
<br>Stalkers should be very versatile 
experts, ready to read and recognize voluntarily altered write patterns.
<br><br>
<a href="usenet.htm">Usenet</a>, for obvious reason 
is the field you should peruse to learn the first elements of the stalking art. These you'll be able to apply, later, 
to any messageboard or email exchange. See, 
once again: the basic premise is that the users are who they 
claim to be. There are, however variances between the different newsgroups 
as to what constitutes a real or "legitimate" identity. And there are numerous cases of 
identity deception, from the pseudo-naive trolls to the shills and kooks and board spammers.<br>
<br>See for a more detailed explanation the ad hoc related sections of searchlores: <a href="usenet.htm">Usenet Lore</a> and <a href="trolls.htm">Trolling Lore</a>

<p><font size=+1>Boring 
as most of these little silly wars are, there are GREAT lessons in stalking hidden in there. That's why you too will 
have to deal with this. Actually, as usual in the Web, many of our techniques cross and merge reciprocally: 
<a href="noanon.htm">Anonymity techniques</a>, <a href="basic.htm">how to search general knowledge</a>, 
<a href="realicra/realicra.htm">reality cracking tricks</a>, <a href="usenet.htm">usenet techniques</a>, 
<a href="antiadve.htm">anti-spamming and anti-advertisement knowledge</a> are ALL required to tackle some of the tasks that you'll have 
to perform if you really intend to master what you are trying to learn now. Let's, moreover not 
forget how useful will be our holy <a href="softreve.htm">software reversing</a> skills each time we'll decide to 
use some of the <u>many tools</u> that the Web offers to track down our targets (tools that are 
unfortunately at times crippled or simply too short-lived :-)
<bR><br>
If you are an experienced 'global' reverser you'll have more survival 
chances that many others, but only your own complementary work, and your own experience, 
will keep you 
<u>acting as a hunter</u> while keeping at the same time <u>your target acting as a game</u> and not the other way round.
<br><br>
Some professional spammers may turn quite nasty AGAINST you, when you'r chasing them, if you're not careful -and powerful- enough.<bR>
<br>
In order to gather more material, just search for 'avoiding flaming' and 'trolls flames' on 
any good search engine or follow some of the links provided here. As you'll see 
there are plenty of documents and faqs on these subjects all over the web.  
<br><br>
<a href="trolls.htm">Trolling</a>, in the stalking 	context, deserves a special mention: the verb denotes, originally, a style of fishing 
in which one <font color=blue>trails bait</font> through a likely spot, hoping for a byte. Real, able and powerful, 
Master trolls have a double audience: 
the idiots (newbies and flamers) that bait the bait and 
the 'trolls-savy' (often silent) that enjoy the troll.  It is indeed possible, albeit difficult, to 
identify and track down experienced trollers. They are in fact among the most interesting game out 
there (together with 
professional spammers on rogue ISP) for any 'professional' stalker.
<br><bR>

So, as said, the basic premise is actually, often enough, that the counterpart, on the web, is NOT who he/she 
claims to be... the danger is that the 
limited identity cues of the netherworld may make people accept at face value 
a writer's claims of
credibility: it may take a long time - and a history of dubious postings - until 
people start to wonder about the actual knowledge of a
self-proclaimed expert. 
<br><br>
This said it is also true that - for web related 
matters - 'official' experts are often FAR inferior to clever autodidacts, so you never 
know&nbsp;:-)
<br><br>When examining  communications, 
it is important to try to distinguish between the 
'expressions given' and the
'expressions given off'. The former are the deliberately stated 
messages indicating how one wishes to be perceived; the latter are
the much more subtle - and sometimes unintentional - messages 
communicated via action and nuance in the real world. Both forms of
expression are subject to deliberate manipulation, but the "expression given off" 
is much harder to control. This is true for the cyber world as well, even if we lack, here, 
the many clues offered by "real world" body language. One can write "I am
female", but sustaining a mind set and reactions that are 
convincingly a woman's may prove to be quite difficult for a man.
<br><br>
Writing style can identify the author of an posting. A known and notorious net personality hoping to appear online under a fresh name
may have an easier time disguising his or her header ID than the identity revealed in the text. The introduction to the cypherpunks
newsgroup includes this warning:<font color=purple>
<prE>
The cypherpunks list has its very own net.loon, a fellow named L. Detweiler. 
The history is too long for here, but he thinks that cypherpunks are evil 
incarnate. If you see a densely worded rant featuring characteristic words 
such as ``medusa'', ``pseudospoofing'', ``treachery'', ``poison'', or ``black lies'', 
it's probably him, no matter what the From: line says. 
							- Cypherpunks mailing list</pre>
							</fonT>
							In 
this case, where the usual assessment signal - the name in the header - is believed to be false, language is used as a more reliable
signal of individual identity. See also 
 how spammers use multiple identities on the very nice 
"<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22kook+of+the+month%22&hl=en&as_qdr=all&start=10&sa=N">Kook of the Month</a>" site.
<br><br>
One newsgroup that contains many business-card signatures is comp.security.unix. The discussion here
is about how to make unix systems secure - and about known system flaws. Many of the
participants are system administrators of major institutions, others are just learning 
how to set up a
system in a fledgling company and some other, of course, are just hoping to learn how to break 
into systems&nbsp;:-)
<br><br>
A posting suggesting
that administrators improve their sites by changing this or that line of code in 
the system software could
be a furtive attempt get novice administrators to introduce security 
holes. Identity deception is a big concern of the participants in
this group, and this makes it VERY interesting for any advanced studiosus of these 
matters, to try  soon or later his luring abilities in this group. (When you'll do 
it, if you want to be taken seriously (and you'll probably don't go very far even so :-) 
first create 'really' your own company, say 'Software Alternative Limited', then name 
yourself 'Director of Software Development', create your domain 
and sign with something like "Director@SALSoft.com".
<p>
Many varieties of identity deception can be found within the Usenet newsgroup. Some are quite harmful
to individuals or to the community; others are innocuous, benefitting the performer without injuring the
group. Some are clearly deceptions, meant to provide a false impression; others are more subtle identity
manipulations, similar to the adjustments in self-presentation we make in many real world situations.
<p>
Until recently, header information was quite reliable. Most people accessed Usenet with software that
inserted the account name automatically - one had to be quite knowledgeable to change the default data.
Today, many programs simply let the writer fill in the name and address to be used, making posting with a
false name and site is much easier. The astute observer may detect suspicious anomalies in the routing
data (the record of how the letter passed through the net) that can expose a posting from a falsified
location. Yet few people are likely to look that closely at a posting unless they have reason to be
suspicious about its provenance.<p>
It is useful to distinguish between pseudonymity and pure anonymity. In the 
virtual world, many degrees
of identification are possible. Full anonymity is one extreme of a continuum 
that runs from the totally
anonymous to the thoroughly named. A pseudonym, though it may be untraceable 
to a real-world person,
may have a well-established reputation in the virtual domain; a pseudonymous 
message may thus come
with a wealth of contextual information about the sender. A purely anonymous 
message, on the other
hand, stands alone.<p>
There are some useful tricks to narrow down the number of suspected targets in 
order to stalk a pseudonym user. One of the best ones I know of is the time trick, but 
in order to understand it you mist first know the elementary elements of an email header.

              <p>It may look confusing, but there are some patterns that tell you everything you need to

<b>Time pattern matters</b> (fravia's trick)<bR>
Now, all the above can be easily faked, what could be really important is that you may be able  
(unfortunately NOT always :-) to discern the TIMES of the day "patterns" when these operations have been 
performed that you can read above. See: if your target 
updates his web page, or mails letters to usenet, he will mostly 
tend to do it on a REGULAR basis. Even if 
he uses automated dynamic providers like Compuserve or AOL (which is always a good idea), 
and even if he writes to the usenet groups through an 
anonymous remailer, or DejaNew itself or whatever, he will tend to do it at FIXED TIMES. It is sometime incredibly 
easy to find out in which part of the world a target lives just studying his timing patterns!.<br>
Most of the people work on Internet in the evening hours, say between 21 and 24:00 local time.<bR>
A common used 'luring' techniques consists in publishing or emailing to your target some 'luring baits' (in order to get the target to react) indicating a (faked and bogus) page of yours on some 
free server, where you have -supposedly- put something that 
the target badly needs or is interested into. Examining the loggings for that page 
you'll be able to see WHEN the target has accessed it. Many targets will access it 
anonymously just in case, yet few targets are careful enough to do that at an "abnormal" hour of the 
day.<hR>
<b>Deleted postings</b> (<a href="stalking.htm#balin">Balif</a>'s trick)<bR>
It may at times be useful to check which <u>cancel messages</u> have been sent to 
the newsgroups.<p>
  As Balif pointed out in a famous posting on alt.2600:  
to examine all <i>the cancel messages</i>, you can use Dejanews, which does
 not honor them but actually archives them. Do a power search on group
 alt.2600, for "control cancel", sorted by date. You can see there all cancel
 messages coming from a given address.
<p>
   Unfortunately Dejanews strips important headers. On your news server,
 cancel messages do not appear in the newsgroup, and are unseen to you.
 However you can view them by looking in the group "control.cancel". Beware,
 this group will most likely be enormous. It contains every cancel message
 your news server has received for all groups. Mine had 75,000 some messages.
 Here you can examine the headers of the cancel message. Yet it takes feeling and 
time to stalk information in this way.
<hR>
<b>Sharp edges</b> (<a href="http://www.sputum.com/sputools.html" tppabs="http://www.sputum.com/sputools.html">SPUTUM</a>'s trick)<bR>
Say you have as your target your balooney@enemy.com; do Altavista and 
Dejanews searches for balooney@enemy.com looking for eventual postings where 
you may find his real name.  Especially check all various  alt.test.whatever 
groups,  as these may contain at least one instance of 'rough' preparatory 
postings, when the target fine-tuned her newsreader's configuration.
<p>
Do Altavista and Dejanews searches on any "sharp edge" that sticks out.<br>"<font color=blue>Sharp 
edges</fonT>" are, 
according to SPUTUM "unique characteristics which can lead one to the real poster". 
Example:  balooney@enemy.com may use as Organization: "balooney inc." on all his 
Usenet posts. Maybe he forgot to remove this info when posting later. 
You search for "Organization: balooney inc." (as well as for posts 
containing his sig), and maybe find all his fatuous 
posts to alt.fetish.threelegs, and from thence 
you will find (if you'r lucky) his narcissistic website  chock full of juicy 
personal information (or at least of many more "sharp edges").
<p>
Other promising "sharp edges": trailing user name in path 
(...!news.foo.com!imamoron), funky newsreaders (ZippityDooDah News Alpha 
0.9), unique signature components.<br>You may add signature patterns, and even particular 
emoticons like &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :-->  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :*) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8-[<br>Look hard. 
Be clever. Reverse your target.<p><font size=+2>
There is a whole section of mine, about sharp edges:<br>read my 
<a href="lanpat.htm" tppabs="http://fravia.net/lanpat.htm">Language patterns and the stalking tablet</a> section.
</fonT><p>
3) What if the target used "X-No-Archive: yes" in her headers and all previous 
steps fail?  You may get lucky, and find <u>a follow-up</u> to a previous post 
which was posted without the "no-archive" clause.  Otherwise, the 
old fashioned 'heavy' way might work: go to the relevant Usenet newsgroup, sort the 
posters by author name, and look for your target "by hand".  Yes the task 
can be extremely tedious...which is why real stalking is for the patient hunter.

An interesting example: the &quot;Bokler guy&quot; identification

This is an old 'historical' example, yet it will quickly show you the power of Dejanew stalking: was one of the links on my 
old links.htm page: an &quot;enemy&quot; wich I described  
as &quot;worth investigating&quot;. In reality this guy is not an &quot;enemy&quot; of 
anybody (he only produces in visual basic 
 pretty simple encryption software) and his &quot;cracker page&quot; is not so bad at all, he use it 
 as &quot;scarecrow&quot; for the 
potential buyer of his software. Hope he will not grudge me if I use him as  an ideal subject 
for this lesson... anyway he makes money
 scaring people with our work, I'll scare him for free showing him what I 
know about him :-)<hr> Here is the original link to his
 page if you want to visit it:<br>

 MMM.. Sounds good: Do we have here the real guy and his pal?
 Let's first check out something else: using whowhere

<font COLOR="#405040">
<pre>
Bokler Software Corp
Santa Fe, New Mexico

<br>
good! So the Bokler company is actually registered in 
 New Mexico, who answers the Alabama telephon? (Four11 search)<br><font COLOR="#405040">
<pre>
Jim Moore 
Alabama,
United States Of America 
E-Mail Address: bockler_1@HIWAAY.NET 
</pre></font><br>
So is simply his HIWAAY provider, rerouting email. Telephon may also
be rerouted in the same way.<br>
 Anyway if we use Infospace we get the address and
the real provider of the web space the other way round:<br><font COLOR="#405040">
<pre>
CompanyName:  Bokler Software Corp 
Address:      1570 Pacheco, Suite E-4 
City:         Santa Fe 
State:        New Mexico 
Contact:      bockler_1@HIWAAY.NET 
Domains:      BOKLER.COM 
</pre></font>
<i><center>
There it is: the company is registered in Santa Fe, the provider is in Alabama. 
 Obviously such a small
 thing does not have a real server, and is hosted by somebody, in this case
 everything on the Bokler page comes through the &quot;hiwaay&quot; business spider, so we can now 
 definitely narrow in on and confirm New Mexico.<br>
 Now we started with almost nothing and we found two names, two addresses, two private telephon
 numbers. Brocklehurst should be the
 real identity only if the &quot;James Moore&quot; name is just an Avatar (which I do not really
 believe given the &quot;Visualbasicality&quot; of these guys). &quot;Darren Brocklehurst&quot; is more probably a co-worker at Bokler
 or a good friend of James Moore and this is the guy we searched for... all in all a pretty good &quot;counter intelligence&quot; 
 work!</i></center>

You'll be able to find interesting examples about Dejanews itself <font color=blue>[</font>on some pages written long ago<font color=blue>]</font>
<p>
Well, yes, Dejanew, as you'll learn on <font color=blue>[</font><a href="usenet.htm">this</a><font color=blue>]</font> page is a very powerful stalking tool 
indeed, and the question "who hides behind dejanew?" is therefore particularly legitime.

<hr size="2">
<center><font size=+3><font COLOR="blue">__Enemy investigation__</font></font><br>


An EXTREMELY interesting example  (now disappeared) was 
 "Balif's debunking".<p>
You need a little background information about this: back in the nineties   
alt.2600 (an old Usenet hacking group) was heavily spammed by a guy known as 
'Archangel', that 
used some of the most widespread techniques: flaming, trolling, crossposting, faked avatars and 
gang emailing, in order 
to gain some dubious personal fame. Of course, in the eyes of 
any reverser worth is weight, Archangel's claims (on an Usenet group!) of 
having worked for the CIA and his 'attention seeking' activities 
did disqualify him immediately (no really competent person would ever 'seek 
attention' on Usenet), yet hundred 
of lusers and newbyes believed  the whole archangelology 
to be "cool and interesting stuff". It is amazingly easy, on the web, to 
brag about things you do not know nothing about. Until some years ago it was still possible
to peruse the results of Balif's stalking activity. Balif, 
a promising hacker and an incredibly good stalker, 
 used intensively the usenet repositories in order to reconstruct the 'history' of the spammer 
Archangel. Mind you: the whole Archangel saga was pretty boring (a typical case of 'flogging 
a dead horse' on usenet: taking topics that have been done to death and rehashing them), and 
DEFINITELY not worth investigating <i>per se</i> yet Balif's pages 
represented  an effective example of  a thorough stalking work.</i>
<p>
BTW, if you want to investigate an earlier stalking project, here you go  
<a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?client=opera&rls=en&q=Archangel+balif&sourceid=opera&ie=UTF-8&oe=utf-8&um=1&sa=N&tab=wg">with an older search</a>, 

where, 
 with Brian's and "electel balif's plot" (among other things), you can also see what a good 
stalker gets out of a picture found on the web!

Some other examples: if you are interested in stalking you'll always get quite interesting info 
from the 'antispammers' fronts:<bR><hr width=22%></center>

<a href="http://dspam.nuclearelephant.com/">http://dspam.nuclearelephant.com/</a> DSPAM (open source!)<br>
DSPAM is an adaptive filter which means it is capable of learning and adapting to each user's email. 
Instead of working off of a list of "rules" to identify spam, DSPAM's probabilistic engine examines 
the content of each message and learns what type of content the user deems as spam (or nonspam). This 
approach to machine-learning provides much higher levels of accuracy than commercial "hodge-podge" solutions, 
and with minimal resources.

For a reverser, stalking can as much great fun as reversing software protections.<p>Next time you receive some 
spamming email DO NOT throw it away. Be cool, and try some of the tricks/techniques described 
above to stalk the spammer. If you have time you may even try the 'go for it' 
trick: most spammers, 
even among the most capable forging dudes, are infact trying to SELL you something, 
aren't they? There dwells the real 
weak point of these assholes. Somewhere, at a given moment  
they <u>have to give you</u> either a real address or a real telephone 
number or whatever in order for you to send them your money.<p>
Fishing spammers can be real fun therefore, especially if you have time, patience, flair and a 
little 
dose of social engineering capabilities.<p>
Once you have them you can administer your favoured punishment, from denouncing them to their 
upstream ISPs supplying service (not always useful) to slowbomb them (until they 
change real address) with 
 faked clients requests and bogus orders for whatever product 
they sell (very funny and frustrating for 
them). This is also IMHO the best method to deal with pyramid schemes: just let a dozen 
postmaster@[127.0.0.1] or whatever enter the scheme eh eh.<p>
A word of advice: don't choose too dangerous gamebirds at the beginning: real nasty people can 
be quite dangerous on the net. It is one thing to stalk a peaceful experienced troller, it is a completely 
different thing to stalk a ring of high-level protected commercial paedophiles. Learn 
your stalking, luring and logical reversing 
ABCs first and don't go around shooting yourself in your feet.
