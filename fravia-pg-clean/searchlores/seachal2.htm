Spelunking boldly 
in the dark world of copyrights.<br>Suggestion: you don't need to aim global... subsidiarity search! find the data for 
-say- Sweden and Spain and you'll be able to extrapolate somehow... even if many, or even almost all parameters do actually 
differ elsewhere...

ramblings. Towards the end of the essay you'll find a page with a series of pointers to current legislation initiatives and 
how to 'read' them. Ok, let's use this thema for a promising 
stalking' lab: WHO EXACTLY DID GO OUT OF HIS WAY IN ORDER TO AVOID serious mad-cow (BSE) enquires in Europe?: 
lobbysts? Who? Producers? Who? Bureaucrats? Who? Euro-Parlamentarians? Who? Members of the COREPER? Who? (<u>Names

Spelunking boldly 
in the dark world of real polytical power and vermineous lobbies.<br>
Suggestion: EP-Minutes; publications of the 'enemies' of your targets (in this case environmentalists and 'greens') and, last but not least, a stab at the almost "media-hidden" COREPER club 
of the 15 powerful 'gray men' (who gave them those powers? When? Who controls them?) who are 
publicity-shy  (quite effectively) and did (and of course will)  delight all sort of nutty 
"conspiration theorists" around the world. These 15 power-brokers are nevertheless worth a full-fledged investigation <i>per se</i>&nbsp;:-)<br>

<hr></fonT><i>Some tips before leaping into it</i>:<ol><lI>
How easy (or difficult) was it to figure out the correct approach? </li><li>
Was the  formulation adequate to help you plan your search?</li><li> 
Which search-approaches and strategies did you choose?</lI><li>
Did you use any "classical" search engine? If so which ones?</li><li>
Did you use any "special" search engine? If so which ones?</li><li>
How many results did you retrieve?  </li><li>
What proportion of the results were relevant to your perceived information requirements?   </li><li>
How current were the results? How many 404s?        </li><li>
Was the amount of detail displayed with the results enough to allow you tho evaluate?  </li><li>
Was the order in which the results were displayed evident or apparently illogical?  </li><li>
What other features contribute to (or detract from) the utility of the tools and approaches you choosed? </li><lI>
Did you time your query?
</lI></ol>
<i>Eh, of course you don't need to answer all the questions above. The purpose of these 
labs is to let you understand how important it is to be more "systematic" when searching the web. You may 
hop, you may leap, you may be a grasshopper or an ant... the only decisive 
factor is the success 
of your query and the time you had to employ: you got the targets you were searching for 
quickly? You won.
