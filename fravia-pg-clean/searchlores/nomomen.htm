<IMG align=left valign=top width=9 height=40 SRC="images/dot_green.gif">
Nothing more than the web, in this new Millennium, underlines the 
old truth about 
<i>nomen est omen</i>. I could hardly find a more telling demonstration of the deep link 
between old-medieval sources research and today-web understanding (and researching) than the 
predominance of names on the web.<br>
<br>Just to make a simple 
example: think at all the "querelles" about and around Internic, with people 
 buying -and hoarding- domainnames 
for  commercial purposes: if I would have bought a free townname domain like, say
 <font color=blue>Altdorf.com</font> when I first published this section,  
soon or later (probably not very soon, seen the slowness and 
incompetence shown in every web-related matter 
by all european 
local administrations&nbsp;:-) the swiss city of Altdorf would have had 
to pay me in order to 
get the domain back.<br>
And this specific name (and a zillion other) where in fact bought 
by third parties later: if you check the following 
<a href="http://www.altdorf.com">link</a>, you will see how some 
clown (in 2005 "ultimate search inc" in Hong Kong, sic!) bought 
this domain using it for commercial purposes.<br>
<br>
Note that now (January 2008) whois will give you 
only the <a href="http://www.moniker.com/domains/domain-privacy.jsp">trash
paid anonimity service</a> covering the real owners. 
<br>
So let's check together this specific domain-name, which could be useful for those 
that still don't know how to do it (of course using <a href="linux.htm">GNU/Linux</a>, searchers shouldn't use 
toy operating systems à la windows):

Back to the point... you could have easily bought, a few years ago, many domainnames corresponding 
to existing european
regions... try now the region names of whatever country you might think of 
adding the suffix 
<font color=blue>*.com</font> and you'll seldom find a "legitimate" domain: 
it's mostly commercial crap, waiting for unwashed to blunder inside the trap. Here "schleswig" as 
a typical example 
where -lo and behold- we find -once again- our very "altdorf" clowns&nbsp;:-)<br>
<a href="http://www.schleswig.com/">http://www.schleswig.com/</a><br>The legit domain is instead  
(the almost impossible to type correctly)  
<a href="http://www.schleswig-holstein.de/">http://www.schleswig-holstein.de/</a>.

<bR>This "triumph of the bogus com sites" situation -once you reverse it- can be used to our advantage.<br>  
In fact -as all searchers know- simply adding the 
 <font color=blue>-".com"</font> [minus com sites] parameter 
will automagically ameliorate  
most queries' results&nbsp;:-)
<br><br><br>

<IMG align=left valign=top width=9 height=40 SRC="images/dot_green.gif">
Domainnames are cheap, and you could buy yourself a dozen every year 
just for fun. 
<br>People do that all the time, as you may check using 
<a href="http://www.netcraft.com">netcraft</a> (which is useful also 
for more general searching 
purposes, as explained elsewhere on <a href="http://www.searchlores.org">searchlores</a>). <br><br>
Actually when you search for internic itself 
you'll immediately bump into the 'name' problem once again: dozens of commercial 
clowns have set up 
bogus "internic" sites, each one with 
a name slightly <font color=blue>similar</font> to internic, in order to 
cash money from the unwashed of this planet, 
unable to search and thus unable to buy directly themselves their own domains from 
the real internic.<br><br>

Here you can gaze in awe yourself, using the incredibly useful netcraft, 
at the high towers of names...  
discover how many people have already registered, say, 
<a href="http://searchdns.netcraft.com/?restriction=site+contains&host=altdorf&lookup=wait..&position=limited">altdorf</a> 
or <font color=blue>internic</font>, often compelling legitimate owners -ICANN in the
last case- to buy a bunch of domains just in case.<br>

<IMG align=left valign=top width=9 height=40 SRC="images/dot_green.gif">
Think -moreover- at all the difficulties you will have, when searching, 
if you don't know the NAMES of the querries. 
Think reversely at how easy it is to find any application or text
on the 
web, using search engines and/or bots and/or ftp-search servers, 
once you know (or imagine and <a href="magicfi.htm">guess</a>&nbsp;:-) THE 
EXACT NAMES given to the files or zipped archives you are looking for.<br>
You'll often have to try it for yourself. You'll need to understand the 8.3 old dos convention. 
Try to access 'not found' pages, 
or pages you suppose should be there, alternating lower and uppercase (significant for 
GNU/Linux severs), or 
trying the suffixes 
*.htm, *.html, *.shtml. 
<br>Try <font color=blue>jpg</font> and <font color=blue>gif</font> as 
suffixes for your target EXECUTABLES, try <font color=blue>doc</font>, <font color=blue>pdf</font> or 
<font color=blue>txt</font> as suffixes for your target PICTURES or mp3.<bR>Try all the bazoo of the 
archived formats: rar, zip, ace, arj, 7z, tar, lpm, lha, bz2, deb, iso...</br><br>
Many more interesting approaches can be found on the <a href="rabbits.htm">'webbits'</a> section.

<br><br>
 Do you actually know what all 
these format names REALLY mean? Did you ever have a look at the format of -say- 
a jpg image? Do it. Hexedit (or rather "khexedit") it.<br><br>
Searchers MUST be able to recognize -say- a gif or a jpg image just looking at the code of an unamed file. 
<br><br>
Another important approach is to  
 <font color=blue>enlarge</font> <a href="synecdoc.htm">synecdochically</a> 
the possible NAMES of a target you are searching. 
<br>
Note moreover that some filenames are being changed all the 
time, and that this will happen routinely for the names of the most interesting targets you may seek&nbsp;:-)
<br><br>
While it is true that you can search for something even WITHOUT knowing it's exact name (as explained below, you'll find more 
in the <a href="images.htm">searching 
images</a> section), 
it is worth OVERESTIMATING the importance of names.

It is in fact <font color=blue>impossible to overestimate the importance of names on the web</font>. 
Let's take a simple example: the 
<SPAN STYLE="color: black; background: yellow">robot.txt</span> file, that is used to tell search engines 
which directories and files they <font color=blue>should 
not</font> index on a specific site. Thus anything that has been put inside a 'robots.txt' file 
will not be found by your searchqueries, provided the <a href="main.htm">search engines</a> 
and <a href="bots.htm">bots</a> 
you are using behave.<bR>
Yet this file is just a list of names. And you can access 
this file easily, looking for it in the main directory of your 
target site, entering per hand the site URL following this pattern:<br>
<SPAN STYLE="color: black; background: yellow">http://www.targetsite.com/robots.txt</span><br>
Thus, once you have checked this txt file and seen the names, you  could  
 type these addresses directly into your browser and access all these various "non public" subdirectories 
and pages.<hr width=66%>
<IMG align=left valign=top width=9 height=40 SRC="images/dot_green.gif">
Another classical "nomen est omen" problem is encountered <font color=blue>when you search 
for programs</font>.
Let's take Wdasm for instance as an example, this is a nice "speedy" -if rather old- disassembler for windows 
written by Peter Urbanik, (Hi Peter!),  that has helped whole generations of both wannabie and 
capable crackers. This program anyway was not known to be on the net under the nameform 
"<font color=blue>wdasm</font>" and its stemmings (wdasm89, wdasm.zip wdasmdis.exe etcetera), 
yet you'll probably fish it (through ftp servers, local/regional fishing and/or 
usenet or agoras searchers) in its 
<font color=blue>w32dsm</font> "nomenestomen incarnation"... 
therefore anyone knowing this name... it is as simple (and "magic") as that.<br><br>
<IMG align=left valign=top width=9 height=40 SRC="images/dot_green.gif">You begin to understand what I mean, 
don't you?<br>What I mean is 
that ANY program or game or image or text, or book, or sound, or film is ALREADY somewhere on the web, any 
possible 
<a href="targets.htm">target</a> is there, somewhere, often enough
you just need to know its name 
to fish it out.<br>

<IMG align=left valign=top width=9 height=40 SRC="images/dot_green.gif">But names (well... words) 
are also powerful WEAPONS. 
<br>

As the <a href="realicra/realicra.htm">reality cracking</a> section of my site tries to demonstrate, 
 a correct use of TERMS when cracking 
reality, can help quite a lot (the very term "reality cracking" is devised to be quite catchy
 <i>eo ipso</i>).<br>Rhetoric is a very neglected yet incredibly powerful 
science (these two aspects being most probably nowadays correlated&nbsp;:-)<br>Whomever reads (and heads) 
his "Lausberg" will soon be able to destroy any advertiser in sight!<br> As an example let's take 
MacDonald. The experience demonstrates that simply explaining to the unwashed  
how awful (and dangerous) 
is the food there, will not break the "peer pressure of perceived coolness" that especially 
young zombies are frequently victim of. So what is necessary is to 'break', or to 'crack' 
their PERCEPTION, throwing against their teeths a "truth revealing" catching phrase that will forever destroy the 
plastic wrappings i.e. the 'bounds' of their consumistic slavery.<br>
This is extremely easy if you simply 
build a powerful (and sharp) rhetorical statement.<br><br><table border=1 align=center>

&nbsp;Eating at MacDonald is just <font color=blue>reverse shitting</font>&nbsp;</font>

I won't go here into the various rethorical tricks hidden inside the phrase you have just read. <br>
There is a <a href="exegesis.htm">section 
of my site</a> that (tries to) deal with this stuff. Let us just state (and hope) that 
such approaches could "illuminate" people for their own good.<br><br>
Anyway the real point is: never underestimate the amazing power of words.
<br>A capable linguist is 
as powerful (and as dangerous) as a capable advertisement 'creative' (these clowns being just evil 
dark forces whereas we reversers are of course sons of the light&nbsp;:-)<br>
<br>Fact is, that few of those that have
 heard or read the above 'reverse shitting'  
definition will hencefort be able to feel once more - when 
eating a BigMac - their advertisement induced 
'coolness'... See? Using a couple of well-chosen terms we have compensated (and destroyed) the power of their 
million-euro heavy advertisement 
propaganda, isn't this fun?&nbsp;:-)

  Gudmund Schuette's <i>Our forefathers</i> ('The Gothonic 
nations'), Cambridge, Unipress, 1933 (especially vol.II) read it and be prepared to gasp in awe.
</li>
<li>to keep rolling (in German):<br>
M.Schoenefeld, <i>Woerterbuch der altgermanischen Personen- und Voelkernamen</i>, 
Tilburg 1910, reprint Heidelberg 1965, his 'etymologischer index' is almost unsurpassed, note his 
assertion: "<i>Zu den unvollkommensten Erzeugnissen der Menschen gehoeren unstreitig die Woerterbuecher</i>" 
</lI>
<li>dulcis in fundo:<br>
Ernst Foerstermann, <i>Altdeutsches Namenbuch</i>, Bonn 1900, reprint Muenchen 1966, 
this is a book that IMHO anyone researching to-day web names and onomastic matters should carefully 
and seriously study in order to learn some metodology... "Bienenfleissig was Foerstermann"...

<IMG align=left valign=top width=9 height=40 SRC="images/dot_green.gif">Do not ne surprised:  
this linguistic, rhetoric AND web-related problematic is quite intertwined and relevant for 
all sort of searches, 
yet there are different ways to approach it.<br>
Reading the essays and lore you'll find here (and elsewhere on the web) 
you'll be again and again confronted with the old <i>nomen 
est omen</i> truth, and you'll find both paths that will allow you to ignore it  and 
ways to harness its power for your own aims.
