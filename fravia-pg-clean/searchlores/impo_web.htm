   <FONT SIZE=+2>(¯`·.¸ The importance of Webrings for combing purposes" ¸.·´¯)

<i>Lorenzo sent me this info some time ago, and, indeed, 
it is worth explaining more in depth how webrings can be 
useful for combing purposes.<br>As Lorenzo writes:</i> "<font color=blue>
This leaves webrings to motivated people, likely to offer good contents (if not, 
they wouldn't put themselves on display) and likely to cluster sites in the appropriate 
rings for their topics (often there are mailing lists etc. behind a 
webring)</font>"<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enjoy!

Fravia+,<br>
A resource that is cited in your page about "combing" but not very well described is
www.webring.org (or www.webring.com); I use it often in my searches with usually good
results.<br><br>
A webring is a set of sites of similar topic, linked in a ring so that you could (in
principle) navigate through all of them all the way back to the starting site; you put in
your pages some special fragments, and you are linked (to the list of all sites and to +1,
+5, -1, -5 and random sites in the ring).<br><br>
Webring.org is a directory and server for this kind of structure (you register the webring
you set up with them, giving a title and textual description).<br><br>
Obviously you don't need them to build a webring, but this site allows searching for your
otherwise less visible ring.<br><br>
Webring.org offers a simple keyword search form that gives you a list of webrings; their
name and description and the number of their sites is shown and for each webring there is a
page with a site list.<br><br>
They also offer a thematic directory, listing all rings in big pages; you can use the search
form within one of these directory branches (not commonly useful: if you need a specific
keyword you don't want to miss results in other sections).<br><br>
After you have found a list of relevant webrings, you must select some and inspect the list
of their sites. How do you choose?<br><br>
Some rings have hundreds of sites, some one or two. The population shouldn't usually be
considered when selecting promising rings, because a single site can give you all the links
and contents you need, while a random (well, not so random) sampling of the sites of a huge
ring will cover the important contents and links (which are obviously redundant if there are
so many sites).<br><br>
You should look at the titles and descriptions of the rings, like you do with the site lists
from a search engine; but in this case titles and description are always freely selected by
the ring maintainer as a presentation and manifesto. Would you prefer seeking pornography in
the "#1 XXX ring" with "thousands of FREE working thumbnails" or in the "<insert perversion>
Association of <insert place> webring" with "the home pages of Association members" ?
Now you have the site list of a ring of relevant topic you have found (of course you should
also check the rings an interesting site you have already found belongs to, by jumping to
their site list) and you must inspect sites; this isn't much different than choosing from a
search engine results page.<br><br>
Be warned that many (even more than half) of the links in the rings you inspect will be
dead. It's a law of nature and it doesn't mean that the other sites aren't updated; often
the site corresponding to a dead link exists but has moved (and is referenced correctly in
the regular links of other sites).<br><br>
You shouldn't bother following the links along the rings, but always open sites in new
windows from the ring site list; the two great benefits of this procedure are that you can
easily discard dead links without useless waiting, and that you can filter sites by looking,
again, at their names and descriptions instead of jumping blindly. Be warned that in my
experience the probability of a browser crash is highly correlated with the number of open
windows.<br><br>
What searches are webrings useful for, and why?<br><br>
If you are interested in a topic that someone might write a specialized page about, chances
are that a few of these people might bother to setup a webring to supplement the normal
links on their site. If you find the ring you find their pages and the pages they link to,
with the obvious very high S/N ratio (you can find only shallow and redundant, but on topic,
pages).<br><br>
Lamers (defined generically as people whose sites you don't want to find) tend to be
uninterested in webrings, or to be uninvited (remember that rings have a maintainer), or to
segregate in their own rings (for example, I saw today in the "Sexuality" section some rings
with typical worthless porn titles mixed with genuine looking rings by "amateurs" and
associations).<br><br>
This leaves webrings to motivated people, likely to offer good contents (if not, they
wouldn't put themselves on display) and likely to cluster sites in the appropriate rings for
their topics (often there are mailing lists etc. behind a webring).<br><br>
Sites unlikely to be found on a webring are those of corporate, academic or government
institutions (too official and egotistical to link with amateurs or between each other) or
those on high-tech topics; yesterday I had only 4 (four) unpromising hits for "Java Swing".<br><br>
I recommend webrings for general and detailed information about the small topics that can be
someone's hobbies and special interests; not for specific people and sites (they aren't
visible in ring descriptions, although you should find them easily from ring sites), nor for
specific files and data you have pinpointed (which might be in the sites you find, but you
don't know exactly where).<br><br>
Some examples of what I successfully searched through webrings:<br>
-The "4d Sports Driving" (aka "Stunts") PC videogame and related software. I easily found a
thriving webring and I got a few slightly different versions of the game, all known level
and resource editing software, many tracks and demos, pages of tips and tricks, etc. in one
or two hours (mostly download time and delays restarting after IE3 crashed).<br>
-The "Roborally" boardgame from Wizards Of The Coast, with a similar outcome in information,
game modifications and software.<bR>
-Documentation about the "Street Fighter" series of coin-op videogames (strategy, history,
variants, etc.)<bR>
-Some popular roleplaying games (adventures and settings, suggested rule modifications,
general discussions, advice and information). This is a particularly interesting case,
because I didn't want to find everything known by man but only a few good sites with
something worth reading and adopting; it was a simple task because site and ring
descriptions are very informative and allow an easy choice.<bR>
-Freely available fonts; in an early stage I discovered important authors and collections
this way, but today I've reached saturation and I only check periodically the main sites for
new releases.<br>
