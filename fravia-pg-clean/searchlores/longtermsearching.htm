Time and again, seekers realize  that many fellow humans don't even know how to use the exclusion operator on google -
this usually leaves us feeling
hollow, sick, and ashamed that we  inhabit the same
planet  (let alone that we belong to the same species) as such scum&nbsp;:-) Time to throw some  knowledgeballs down the webhills!</i>

 The following 'tips' are intended mostly for LONGTERM searching. If you  embark in 
 a shortterm searching project, be aware that some of the searching techniques <a href="tips.htm">will be different</a>. Ditto for 
 "<a href="deepweb_searching.htm">deep web</a>" searching purposes.

I think  we should slowly try to 'structure & organize' a little our searching Academia. Many, during my <a href="mines.htm">lectures</a>, 
keep telling me that some of the techniques we explain are "waay too complicated for their needs", they want to know what 
I would do "in practice" when searching for this 
or that specific target.<br> 
The answer is of course that first of all your searching approach  
depends on your <a href="targets.htm">targets</a>, second, that your needs shouldn't be too modest (finding at once any book, 
any music and any software you want is the minimum to start with) and that -besides- there's nothing complicated at all in our techniques, since
the web was -from the beginning- <font color=blue>MADE</font> for sharing&nbsp;:-)<br> 
<br>On the contrary, our searching and seeking techniques usually do appear 
rather simple -even banal- <font color=blue>once explained</font> and understood (In fact 
<font color=blue>a posteriori</font> most things are quite banal, duh).
<br><br> Yet the request for more "systematic" explanations remains legitimate. 
So I will do my best to explain our approaches a little more, and I will begin with 
some  
 points I believe searchers should take account of,  when embarking on their "<font color=blue>long term searches</font>". Note that 
this is of course an essay <i>in fieri</i>: other seekers' contributions are urgently needed. Note also that  most  
advice applies for any kind of search, not only web-related searches.<br><br>
What is a <font color=blue>long term search</font>?<br>
There is a huge difference between the "usual" "on the fly" searches (say when you want a 
specific book, see the <a href="tips.htm">shortterm 
searching tips</a>) 
and your own (usually few) "<font color=blue>long term</font>" "thematic" searches.
 These are the two/three "searching passions" that anyone has in a given year (or given life): those targets that 
 one most cherishes, maybe for work purposes, maybe (better imho) for his/her pleasure and for the knowledge. 
 <br>While for the usual "everyday" searches 
  <font color=blue>if you do not 
 find what you are looking for in 15 minutes it probably 
 means that your search strategy is wrong</font>,  for any long term search, the strategies themselves will change, 
 evolve and be refined along the process. Hence for a long term search 
 a week is not enough, a month is not enough, 
 a year is not enough. For my own searches I fear that my life won't be enough.
 <br><br>For long term searches 
 the old truth that <font color=blue>searching is a process</font> applies in spades. <br>In fact 
  <font color=blue>you need to know something to find out something more</font>: this means that for those 
  targets you really cherish <font color=blue>you will have to become an expert</font>, both 
  for searching and for <a href="evalessa.htm">evaluation</a> purposes. <br>
  Anyway the most important thing is to <font color=blue>prepare</font> -at least a little- your 
  long term searches: <i>Estote parati</i>!

<hr width=66% align=left><font size=+2>
1. Develop your search strategy: <font color=blue>prepare a written plan</font>
</font><br><br>
This is VERY important. A simple five minutes long "brainstorming" before beginning 
your search, <font color=blue>writing down</font> your  scope and a preliminary list of keywords will pay jackpots 
whenever you will risk to run amok and then get lost inside the dark web-woods.<br>
Break the query down into its
components, <font color=blue>record</font> the various terms (or concepts) and their
definitions and prepare a first small list of synonims and/or <a href="http://humanities.byu.edu/rhetoric/Figures/S/synecdoche.htm">synecdoches</a>. <br>
The <a href="synecdoc.htm">synecdochical searching method</a> may (may) help
when  some components  are too difficult to describe linguistically and cannot therefore be searched effectively.
<br>
For instance, imagine you'r searching for ways and techniques to understand 
which is the real mother tongue of a  writer of an  English web-snippet or email (there's <a href="lanpat.htm">an old essay 
on my site about this</a>).
This is a concept so vague and complex that it cannot be
captured with a specific set of terms. In such cases you will have to try "to spiral" around your signal, finding querystrings along the way 
and sharpening them while you go. Use clear and specific terms at the beginning of your search process,  you'll refine later your query, again and again.
<br>However you should always try your best to
prepare a  written list and a quiver full of sharp querystrings 
<font color=blue>before even beginning your search</font>, even if we all know how 
the <font color=blue>very definition of the topic</font>  will change gradually   in
the course of the search process.

<a name="prune"></a>
<br><br>
<hr width=66% align=left><font size=+2>
2. Prioritize queryterms and concepts: determine whether the feathers in your arrows are really 
necessary or are just optional criteria. <font color=blue>Prune your query</font>!
</font><br><br>Now that you have that list of terms, you need to put some order into it.<br>
You should specify not only your  scope, but also the limits of your search (careful when limiting to specific document types!). 
You should list as many concepts <font color=blue>that should not be included</font> as possible, and limit your query, if necessary, by 
publication date (using any good <a href="daterange.htm">daterange</a> utility). Be careful with date limits as well: 
 systematic searches should try to gather all relevant material
regardless of date.<br>So the most effective "limiting" approach will mostly be term-related, and based on the exclusion of some specific 
operators. For instance, for <a href="google.htm">google</a>: <font color=blue>-intitle:</font>, <font color=blue>-allintitle:</font>, <font color=blue>-inurl:</font>, 
<font color=blue>-allinurl:</font>, <font color=blue>-allintext:</font>, <font color=blue>-inanchor:</font> and so on. For <a href="inktomi.html">yahoo</a>, 
<font color=blue>-path:</font>, <font color=blue>-inurl:</font> and so on.<br>
Here a classical (short term and book related) "four-pruned" example:<br>
<a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=%22title%3Aindex+title%3Aof%22+-originurlextension%3Ahtm+-originurlextension%3Ahtml+-papers+-copyright+%2BOreilly&prssweb=Search&ei=UTF-8&fr=sfp&n=100&fl=0&x=wrt">"title:index title:of" -originurlextension:htm -originurlextension:html -papers -copyright +Oreilly</a>
<br>
A gardener prunes the branches of his trees to
contain their growth to the proper scale of the garden. <font color=blue>Prune your queries</font>!
<br>
Search term selection and usage are as
 important as the selection and usage of operators or booleans, and maybe even more: 
in fact simply increasing the complexity of a given query <font color=blue>
adding advanced operators</font> has  usually a less remarkable effect on your query results.
To make a simple example, while adding to your querystrings the operator 
 <font color=blue>-"site:com"</font>   will often times improve your search (eliminating 
 all "<font color=blue>.com</font>" sites: good riddance&nbsp;:-), a careful 
 choice of a new search term (related to your specific query) will probably "cut" the web to your signal waay better, 
 pushing your target silhouette much more clearly against  the background noise of the commercial (crap) web.
<br>
Therefore strong attention must be paid to all issues
related to <font color=blue>the selection and use of search terms</font>, clearly 
the selection of search terms matters quite a lot, and should be well thought (and evaluated
carefully) when looking for the best possible search
results. If you are not pleased
with your SERPs, even some small swapping and/or change may lead to a significantly
different (and potentially better) outcome. You'll  of course get relevance differences  through 
the use of complex operators as well, but the results may not always be worth the time invested.
<br>
A graphical approach may be very useful in this context: a simple column structure (on the left the concepts, on the right the terms), 
will help you as a first quick "frame reference", while 
 some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_diagram">Euler diagrams</a>  will allow you 
to quickly grasp the "form" and the "color" of you query.<br>The terms should also depend on your 
<font color=blue>recall  needs</font> (recall is the percentage of all relevant documents available
that is retrieved by your query). For high recall results, it is often necessary
to include terms that will -alas- capture many unwanted items in
order to fetch a few relevant ones. 
<br>To gather more (relevant) terms you
 may also try to use  a couple of <font color=blue>graphical and clustering</font> search engines (For instance <a href="main.htm#mapa">Kart00, 
Touch, 
Ujiko, 
Dicy or
Mooter</a>). These will widen the "image" of your query. In fact you should now begin to smell your "scent" even before beginning!

<a name="feel"></a>
<br><br>
<hr width=66% align=left><font size=+2>
3. Run preliminary searches in order to "<font color=blue>feel the searchscape</font>"
</font><br><br>
Use at least three among the <a href="main.htm">main</a> search engines. Check the results, you will 
soon notice that they do not overlap very much. Check if your "quiver" of queries is rich enough or if 
you need more arrows to begin with. <br>
Remember, however, that 
expanding a search including
broader and/or narrower concepts 
will (mostly) <font color=blue>increase the number of results</font>. 
There's a trade off you must be aware of: in some cases this will be 
necessary in order to fetch all relevant documents, in other
cases this may mean that you will have many irrelevant
results.<br>
It is often best to begin with those querystrings 
(collection of terms) that are the most specific, most important and/or <font color=blue>the least
frequently occurring</font>.

<br>Not all concepts identified in the search plan need to
be included in all searches. When you increase the number of terms required in 
your
target documents, the number of documents retrieved
by your queries will of course decrease. Your imagination in choosing and/or swapping the 
query terms when cross-searching, and your capacity to adapt the choice of terms to the 
fields of data you will be mowing (the web at large? A specific database? A on-line library?) will often 
mean success or failure. Note that -as a rule of thumb- if you'r searching FULL CORPORA of texts you should  
include a lot of terms and be as specific as you manage (without tilting the query of course), while if you'r 
searching among TITLES (say a <a href="journals.htm">Journal</a> titles-database) you should be much more 
careful when adding feathers to your search-arrows: <font color=blue>the number of
terms included in a query should in general be proportional
to the amount of data being searched</font>.
<br>
During this phase the seeker is still just 'shooting arrows': testing different terminological combinations.
Basically you run a search, examine the overall patterns in the
SERPs,  study closely the several highly relevant
results, and then reformulate the search to improve its effectiveness.
<br><font color=blue>Just one change at a time!</font> Then test
it, and add something more only when happy with the results. If you make
several changes at once to your querystring it will be difficult to assess the impact of each
individual change, duh.


<br>
We are still inside the iterative, cyclical,
trial and error phase of the seeking process, but you 
should now begin to smell the "scent" of your quarry. You should now hear the signal <font color=blue>loud</font> 
among the noise.
The "conceptual terms swapping" approach should now be finished. Should you have to change it during the following phases, you 
will need to re-run your preliminary searches as well. Enough words playing. Now it's time to switch over to some "operational" techniques.


<a name="comb"></a>
<br><br>
<hr width=66% align=left><font size=+2>
4. Let's now wade into the morasses. <font color=blue>Comb the deep deep web</font> 
</font><br><br>
First of all we will search through <a href="combing.htm">combing</a>: we will search people that have searched and people in the know.
<br>
For instance (but of course it depends on your <a href="targets.htm">target</a>) we find all electronic literature databases 
relevant to
the topic, we will find as many relevant messageboards and key <a href="journals.htm">journals</a> as we can, and find all related books we will manage to fetch.<br>
One possible way to do this, is to investigate the various reference lists 
you  find <font color=blue>and then search</font> for the quoted references you have found inside your SERPs.
<br>
Chances are that if a <a href="journals.htm">journal</a> denies you access to its articles, for some petty commercial reasons, 
those very articles <a href="Helsinki_.htm#sciart">will still exist in other copies 
around the web</a>: the web -remember- was made for sharing. 
If you don't find your target on the wild, you'll go back to 
the database that keeps it captive and either <a href="password.htm">find some entrance</a> or <a href="magicfi.htm">guess some entrance</a>
or, eventually, gosh, even almost <a href="tools.htm#ccg">pay</a> for it.<br>
Slowly, a pattern of <a href="journals.htm">journals</a>, messageboards, databases and experts will emerge. The scent will be very strong.
Still <a href="luring.htm">social engineering</a>  
can be extremely useful when you get 'stuck' and are not able to find a given book: 
get in touch and consult experts doing research in your target topic
area. Most of the time they will be ready and glad to help you. As a rule of thumb, experts and writers are extremely annoyed 
that nobody cares for their knowledge/books and will mostly bend backwards in order to help the few that seem to be interested.
<br>
Successful Web searches rest on a
combination of experience and domain knowledge. To be successful in information retrieval
one must be (or get) knowledgeable
about the search topic.
<br>
Little by little you will <font color=blue>and must</font>  become familiar with your target field and be capable to identify, <a href="evaluate.htm">evaluate and assess</a>
your target's experts, messageboards, webrings, articles, 
reviews and books. The <a href="evaluate.htm">evaluation part</a> is a most important part of this search process.
<br>But evaluating means evaluating USING YOUR OWN SOUND PARAMETERS, not somebody else's ones.
<br>
It is also important
to remain responsive to all new information that emerges during the
search, and not just fetch the type of information
you expected to find before beginning your query. You should try to maximize any <font color=blue>feedback potential</font> 
examining your SERPs with a synthetically oriented,  completely <font color=blue>open</font> approach.<br> 
Always question "authority" and don't ever accept 
the "official" searchscape if your results do appear to contradict it. Remember that you know what you 
are doing <font color=blue>and how to search deeper and further</font>, while chances are that 
those you found <font color=blue>do not know zilch</font> about how to search the web. This brings us to the next point.


<a name="grey"></a>
<br><br>
<hr width=66% align=left><font size=+2>
5. Identify relevant unpublished
or not widely distributed literature and sources (<font color=blue>mow the "grey areas"</font>)
</font><br><br>
This is more important than many (would be & self called) experts would like to admit. Nowadays journals' articles and books are often 
just concoctions of material ripped from the web. There is 
a plethora of books about "google searching techniques" and "google hacking" all around the web (and also in any bookshop, but there
they seem even <u>to demand money for them</u>, go figure&nbsp;:-)<br>
Some  of these books are so full of 
evident 
mistakes and of stolen -but not understood- snippets that, seriously, with a bit of urine and a big ball of clay, any good seeker 
could completely recreate their (soi-disant) "authors".



<br> Plagiarism (and plagiarism-proofing) has now reached paroxysmal  dimensions. 
While seekers 
can (and often do) counter this, almost no one else is able to do it. 
There are even agencies that let themselves being paid "to search for plagiarisms" (through google, 
nonetheless&nbsp;:-)<br>This is ludicrous. I  believe that a sound
thrashing followed by inadequate medical attention is the way to
deal with people willing to pay for such "services" instead of checking on their own if someone did or did not made use of plagiarism.<br>
Fact is, that <font color=blue>the grey areas of the web</font> (conference papers and proceedings, unpublished dissertations 
on relevant topics, 
"unofficial" messageboards, IRC channels, and even -gosh- 
not widely know <a href="blog.htm">blogs</a>)
 offer most of the time top-notch information. <br>That's one of the reasons <font color=blue>it could be quite 
 dangerous to limit searches to pdf or doc files</font>: a lot of information is published in just ole plain html (like 
 this very file you'r reading&nbsp;:-)
 <br>
As  all searchers realize -soon or later- there's <u>a lot to learn</u> from people that are completely or partly outside the 
'official' academic salons. Of course, once again, your <a href="evaluate.htm">evaluation</a> sklls are of critical 
(in all senses of the word) importance.
<br>
Moreover there are "<font color=blue>web tides</font>": moments when suddendly 
there are encounters between the "official" academic fauna and the many grey hats that abound on the web. 
<font color=blue>The waves roll slowly on the Web</font>. 
On the Internet seekers can frequently observe micro-communities, 
working along similar paths and with interests in similar fields, 
that ignore reciprocally their existence for an inexplicable long time. 
This has of course to do with both the vastness of the web and the fact that people do not know how to search.


<a name="appro"></a>
<br><br>
<hr width=66% align=left><font size=+2>
6. Review the written plan regularly to incorporate new discoveries. <font color=blue>Try different approaches</font> just in case</font><br><br>
Searching is a PROCESS. It is of paramount importance that 
you constantly  update your frames of reference using the material you have found.
Possible promising alternative approaches should be listed as well (for a rainy day).
<br>
Also, for "very long" long-term searches, remember, when reviewing results, to  checklist
the sources searched and the approaches you used, to prevent wasting time in duplicating efforts.<br>
A good idea is to "re-do" your search -just in case- <font color=blue>without using google at all</font>. 
This will force you to follow completely different paths, 
since the <a href="main.htm">main</a> search engines don't overlap that much.<br>
Another possibility is to try to use different approaches, like <a href="ftp.htm">ftp searches</a>, <a href="usenet.htm">usenet</a> &
<a href="blog.htm">blogs searches</a>, <a href="irc.htm">irc searches</a>, <a href="trolls.htm">trolling</a> and all the other many 
seekers' paraphernalia in order to try to get to your target "from behind".   <br>
Here's a simple trick: once every -say- three months try your longterm search queries NOT ON GOOGLE but on <a href="quickforms.htm">A9</a>, or on 
<a href="quickforms.htm">exalead</a>, or even on a <a href="compound.htm">meta</a> search engine like 
<a href="quickforms.htm">seekz</a>... yep, indeed, they don't overlap that much, yep, of course, I knew you would have enjoyed it&nbsp;:-)

<a name="lang"></a>
<br><br>
<hr width=66% align=left><font size=+2>
7. Re-run your query using <font color=blue>different languages</font>
</font><br><br>
This <a href="regional.htm">regional</a> approach is often underestimated. There's a widespread belief that 
if something is important enough, it will exist in English as well. This is not only untrue, but quite 
far off the mark. Especially many language-impaired English-speaking friends discover with amazement the wealth 
of results available in -say- German, French, Spanish, Russian, Japanese, Korean, Italian, Hindi and Chinese (just to name a few  
important languages... I could continue this list). There are many <a href="dictiona.htm">translation</a> 
<a href="eurosearch.htm">tools</a> available on the web, 
even for <a target=_top href="http://www.rikai.com/perl/Home.pl">Japanese</a>:-)<br>It should 
be noted <i>en passant</i> that
 knowing -at least passively- some foreign languages is, for Web-seekers, almost a sine qua non.<br>
 Never underestimate the importance of going regional with your long term queries. The wealth of results that 
local, country specific and relatively "obscure" search engines may give -for some targets- can really be 
 impressive, and will often make all the difference between an average  performance and a excellent search .



<a name="reco"></a>
<br><br>
<hr width=66% align=left><font size=+2>
8. <font color=blue>Keep records</font> of all your search activities
</font><br><br>Systematic record keeping is OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE when searching. The classical mistake 
of almost all newbie seekers is to 'forget' to keep records during their long-term searches.<br>
For this purpose I suggest you simply use the NOTE function in <a href="tuttiope.htm">Opera</a>, just highlight the target 
text you are interested in, 
rightclick, and then chose <font color=blue>copy to note</font> (or use the keyboard shortcuts, either
 CTRL+SHIFT+C or CTRL+ALT+E depending from the version of Opera you'r using): 
the URL of the page you'r viewing at that moment *and the date* will be automatically stored in your note 
*together with the highlighted text*.<br>
You should create ad hoc <font color=blue>note folders</font> (for instance 
"<font color=blue>research_on_canaletto_29SEP2005</font>") and, at the 
end of your search, before switching the box off and go to sleep, just move all your 
related notes inside the correct folders. Opera's Notes are just text format, very easy to edit, 
cat, search or prune.<br>
Alternatively use something else, even a pen and a sheet of paper will do. DO NOT rely on your memory alone (or on your 
extraordinary seeking capabilities to re-find at once what you may have lost&nbsp;:-)<br>
If you do, you will regret it. Sooner 
than you believe.


<a name="mista"></a>

9. How do you know if your search is/was effective or not? <font color=blue>Check your mistakes</font>
</font><br><br>
Well the short answer is: you will know, because you will "feel" it&nbsp;:-)<br>
The long answer is -instead- that you will never know for sure. 
The effectiveness of a given search is generally measured in terms of
<font color=blue>precision</font> (how many retrieved documents are relevant to your query? 100%? 50%? 10%?)
and <font color=blue>recall</font> (how many <font color=blue>of all</font> the theoretically available <font color=blue>relevant</font> documents have been
 retrieved through your specific query?  100%? 50%? 10%?). Alas! Both parameters, and especially the second one, recall,
 are IMPOSSIBLE to gauge on the wide web, because it is impossible 
to check -manually or automatically- all existing targets documents in order to
determine how many are relevant. But you can gauge them on specific web-subsets, say a given (small) database.
<br>
Poor seekers believe the relationship between
precision and recall to be <font color=blue>always a trade off</font>: more precision means less recall and vice versa. <br>
In fact this very much  depends on your <a href="https://searchlores.nickifaulk.com/targets">target</a> and on the 'form' of your queries.
Usually the trade off is very strong during the first phase of a query, but while refining and swapping terms, later on,
you may be able -if you know what you do- to increase
both precision and recall.<br>
Another possibility is to use FRIENDS. Each seeker seeks in a different way. Each human being sees  different (sets of) 
patterns when investigating the same amount of data. Conducting multiple human investigations on the same target will bring 
a considerable amount of "freshness" to your original query. Individual approaches may completely 
determine the output of the search, often more than any other factor. Simply consulting with others can help you to obtain 
 new valuable arrows and improve your overall results. Of course the web is the ideal medium  for this.<br>
 Checking for possible mistakes INSIDE your queries (or gaps) may also be useful in order to make
  your search much more effective.
 <br>
 There are many common errors:
Spelling errors, terminological & conceptual errors (forgetting important terms), 
boolean (AND and OR) errors, definition 'scope' errors, combing errors (forgetting important resources), 
reviewing errors, 
evaluation errors, forgetting truncation possibilities, insufficient 'regionalization' of the query, and so on.
Don't be too snotty when assessing your own queries. Chances are you DID forget something&nbsp;:-)

Estote parati!
