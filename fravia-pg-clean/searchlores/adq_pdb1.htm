Some (inexpert) searchers may not immediately see the connection between 
the matters investigated here and our web-searching activities.
Rest assured, however, that if you take the time to understand and try 
out some (or, even better, all) of the hints you'll find here you'll have 
added a couple of powerful (and sharp) arrows to your seeker's quiver.   
Andrew has published this work @ sourceforge as well.

<hr width=44%>
</CENTER>

    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>This document describes a source of information leakage discovered during 
      research into Microsoft's Program DataBase (PDB) debugging information files.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>This project originally started as an investigation into Microsoft's Program 
      DataBase (PDB) debugging information files. I started off looking at the <a href="http://www.winehq.org">
        WINE</a> implementation of the DbgHelp APIs, but quickly found that Microsoft 
      had introduced a new, incompatable, format with Visual Studio.NET. Whilst 
      researching this new format, I found the Debug Information Accessor (DIA) SDK 
      2.0 which was handily provided with Visual Studio.NET.</p>
    <p>This provided a great deal of functionality, much more than the old DbgHelp 
      APIs. Unfortunately, however, it also had a COM interface that was quite hard 
      to use. To ameliorate this, I started writing DiaLib, a C++ wrapper around the 
      COM interface.</p>
    <p>To test this library, I wrote PdbDump, which is a simple tool to dump out the 
      contents of PDB files.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>PDB Private Information</h3>
    <p>I had assumed, like most people, that PDB files contained just a simple list 
      of function names and addresses; this is all that the old DbgHelp API exposed. 
      However, while developing DiaLib, I noticed that on <em>certain</em> PDB files, 
      PdbDump was outputting a lot more information than I had expected. This 
      included C++ class prototypes, full enumeration definitions, local function 
      variables, and much more.</p>
    <p>Later I noticed that if I linked a debug version of a program against .LIB 
      files (or .OBJ files), the generated PDB file would contain private information 
      from the third party .LIB file <em>as well as </em>my own code.</p>
    <p>This information is akin to the metadata in CLR or Java programs. It provides 
      information on data structures, function prototypes, and certain variables in 
      the compiled code. It does <strong>not </strong>contain any of the original 
      sourcecode. So while it doesn't provide people with details of private 
      algorithms, it does provide them with a lot more private information than 
      expected.</p>
    <p>This situation is obviously not ideal if you are releasing a commerical 
      library.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>PDB Private Information in .OBJ/.LIB Files</h3>
    <p>This is a more complex issue, and is best described with the help of an 
<a href="zipped/demopdbproject.zip">
        example</a>. This contains a sample VS.NET C++ project containing a static 
      library and an executable which uses that library.</p>
    <p>The static library contains a public function, a private function, and a 
      private structure definition. If you compile the projects as is (Debug or 
      Release targets), and run pdbdump on the resulting <code>testexe.pdb</code> file, 
      you will find the following somewhere in the output (edited to remove 
      irrelevancies):</p>
    <pre>
struct privatestruct1 {
  // non-static data --------------------------------
  /*&lt;thisrel this0x0+&gt;*/ /*|0x4|*/ int a;
  /*&lt;thisrel this0x4+&gt;*/ /*|0x4|*/ int c;
  /*&lt;thisrel this0x8+&gt;*/ /*|0x4|*/ char* banana;
};
// &lt;size 0xc&gt;

char* __cdecl aPublicFunction(/*&lt;regrel ebp0x8+&gt;*/ /*|0x4|*/ char* banana);
// &lt;rva 0x11a60&gt;
// &lt;size 0x57&gt;
// &lt;staticlocal &lt;rva 0x11aaf*&gt;*/ /*|0x0|*/ ... &gt; 
// &lt;staticlocal &lt;rva 0x11aa3*&gt;*/ /*|0x0|*/ ... &gt; 
// &lt;staticlocal &lt;rva 0x11a9b*&gt;*/ /*|0x0|*/ ... &gt; 
// &lt;staticlocal &lt;rva 0x284e0*&gt;*/ /*|0x4|*/ int hello&gt;
// &lt;local &lt;regrel ebp-0x10*&gt;*/ /*|0xc|*/ struct privatestruct1 struct1&gt;

char* __cdecl aPrivateFunction(/*&lt;regrel ebp0x8+&gt;*/ /*|0x4|*/ struct privatestruct1* privateStructArg);
</pre>
    <p>As you can see, a considerable amount of information has leaked out of the 
      static library. The private structure definition is visible, and even the 
      static variable in aPublicFunction() is exposed. PdbDump does not output line 
      number information, but it is likely that this is present as well.</p>
    <p>
      The problem with .LIB files is that there are no visible PDB files present, yet 
      somehow this information still leaks. If you dump the .LIB file with <code>ar t 
        testlibrary.lib</code> (yes, .LIB files are just AR archives :), the only 
      object visible is <code>object1.obj</code>. Therefore, the PDB information must 
      be stored inside .OBJ files.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Stripping Private Information</h3>
    <p>To remove this private information from PDB files, you must use the <code>/PDBSTRIPPED</code>
      flag on Microsoft's compiler. This will reduce the PDB file to just function 
      names.</p>
    <p>
      Static .OBJ or .LIB files. You can remove the information from these by 
      disabling debug information generation completely when compiling the <strong>source
      </strong>files for the library. It should be noted that Visual Studio sets 
      the debugging status to "Program Database for Edit &amp; Continue (/ZI)" if you 
      create a library project using its wizard. I have not been able to find a 
      switch equivalent to <code>/PDBSTRIPPED</code> for .OBJ/.LIB files.
    </p>
    <p>DLL files do not require any form of stripping as long as any supplied debug 
      information is contained in a PDBSTRIPPED PDB file. However, I believe there 
      are other methods of storing debugging information; I have not investigated 
      these for this problem.</p>
    <p>I would recommend using PdbDump as a tool to check for information leakage in 
      your commercially released PDB files, and also enusuring that no debug 
      information is creeping into released .OBJ/.LIB files.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Future work</h3>
    <p>The next focus of this project will be to write a program to strip the private 
      information from .OBJ/.LIB files (like the <code>/PDBSTRIPPED</code> option). 
      Basic debugging (with function names) should still be possible, but the private 
      information will be removed.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Availability</h3>
    <p>DiaLib and PdbDump are both hosted on sourceforge <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pdbdump">
        here</a>. They are licensed under a BSD-style license.</p>
