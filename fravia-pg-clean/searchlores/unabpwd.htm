Dear friends
<br>I wanted to prepare, as next step, an essay on how to break ANY common username/password combination. This is a trivial deed, using the right tools and techniques, and  - as you very well know - the best 'artists' in this lore, the people we can LEARN from, are porn-sites intruders a la http://forums.asp-dev.co.uk/freepass/ & the germans at dany.
<br>
<br>Seekers need this kind of knowledge in order to access newspapers and library databases as well, duh, therefore I think and believe it would be 'angebracht' to delve in such a lore, using the same programs (but of course DIFFERENT combolists) in order to gain knowledge access.
<br>
<br>I have tried to reach Giglio, but he does not answer any more. So I need help.
<br>
<br>I am going to prepare this (soon or later) alone, if neds be. Unfortunately I will not have that much time in the next months.
<br>Hence: your help would be welcome and useful... preparing essays 'synthtetizing' these 'pornpass' knowledges into useful "how to access databases when you have forgotten your password" essays.
<br>
<br>Work well,
<br>F+

There has been a spreading of router hacking tools inside the usual "grey" channels in recent days (inter alia BGP -Border Gateway Protocol- breaking kits) remember that routers send updates to other routers, moreover they often use default passwords on the cisco routers... hence the relevance to this thread topic. 
<br>Anyone has the time and interest to follow a little what's going on and report, least we will be caught ourselves unaware?

<br>Part 1 – Introduction –
<br>
<br>Me, Why, The motives, The people:
<br>
<br>I would like to begin first with a bit of background on myself. Prior to the last nine months that I have spent password hacking I spent over a year as a Software Reverse Engineer. In that time I gathered a lot of skills, dabbled in complex serial number algorithms and sometimes just laughed at the sheer stupidity of some programmers. I then had a lot of friends ask me to hack passwords for porn sites. Never being one to back down from a challenge I got to reading. The problem that I noticed was the lack of information available on this topic. I read a couple of essays at the old IceFortress site and started experimenting. I soon realised that it is not that difficult after all. 
<br>
<br>I spent the next eight months casually hacking sites for friends, building my skills. I then decided that I could stand no longer these huge pass sites on the net that are all just misleading scams, so I started my own site. Still learning, I discovered:
<br>
<br>1. The amount of work involved in maintaining a password site 
<br>
<br>2. How greedy and rude the majority of people are.
<br>
<br>
<br>In saying that, I then turned my site into an information source for newbie hackers to learn the skills that I am willing to pass on. 
<br>
<br>If you follow the forthcoming lessons carefully, dedicate yourself and most of all have a lot of patience(or a really fast connection), then you will learn something. I hope that will make you capable of getting into all the sites you desire. You will then be able to help others, and the pyramid spreads from there. 
<br>
<br>
<br>I do realise that compared to a lot of other password hackers nine months in the bigger scheme of things is not really that long. However I do feel that I have something to contribute in my writings to follow and I do invite constructive criticism as well as comments and feedback. 
<br>
<br>
<br>I hope that you do enjoy reading these lessons. I will try and cover as much as possible in as much detail as I can so that almost anybody has a shot at understanding what it is that I'm going on about. Now enough blabbering on to the good stuff... :-) These are common terms that I will be using throughout my lessons. It's better that you read them now and as you come across them, refer back to the list. It will make things a lot clearer. 
<br>
<br>
<br>Part 2 – Common Terms
<br>
<br>Brute Force: 
<br>- This is the term give to multiple attempts at breaking a form of protection. For example if I had a lock that had a three digit combination, brute force would be to try every combination from 001 to 999. Eventually I would get the combination. 
<br>
<br>
<br>Wordlist:
<br>- Unfortunately when attempting to hack a site it is just not logical to try every combination. Instead in your travels you will build your own personal wordlist. This wordlist can be simply a huge list of all possible common passwords. Everything from aardvark to zebra. Or it could more likely be a combo list(definition below) in the form mickey:mouse. These are lists of possible passwords that you will use in your brute force attempts.
<br>
<br>Combo List: 
<br>- The majority of hacks that you will make will be from your combo list. This is a list of the form donald:duck. Username and passwords can be separated by a colon ( or a Tab, this varies depending on the program that you are using. More information will be given later in the section on building wordlists. These are the main programs that I use in day to day hacking. Each has advantages and disadvantages, some have been listed below.
<br>
<br>
<br>Part 3 – The tools you need –
<br>
<br>Access Diver v4.00: 
<br>
<br>- In my opinion lacks the functionality of Goldeneye however it has a good security exploiter that I quite often use.
<br>
<br>Ares: 
<br>- Wonderful user friendly interface. Has the ability to detect when a site gives off fake passes. Lacks however a lot of the extra options that programs such as Goldeneye have. Gets better and better with every release. I feel it will become a hacker's choice utility.
<br>
<br>Goldeneye: 
<br>- The main program that I use day to day in my attempts. Can look scary to start with because of all the configurable options but once you become more skilled you will realise that this program has the best functionality. 
<br>
<br>Raptor II: 
<br>- The best word utility you will ever use. Has wonderful sort and management features. Runs brilliantly on my PC. This program is a godsend. 
<br>
<br>Webcracker v4.0: 
<br>- The first hacking program that I ever used. Great Graphical User Interface with only a few options to configure. I recommend for newbies. Just lacks a lot of the extra functions as well. 
<br>
<br>
<br>Part 4 – Link where to get –
<br>
<br>http://www.deny.de (HamSolo: deny.de JUST got back ******, so they don't have hardly ANYTHING set up YET, but they DO still have ALL of their old files, so its only a matter of time until they are back UP to running at full speed.)
<br>
<br>- will provide links to all of the above mentioned tools. As I write these lessons they will take you through password hacking basically stage by stage however I of course recommend that supplementary reading won't hurt. The first topic that I suggest you research is the use of proxys and anonymity on the Internet. This is an extremely important topic. My next lesson will cover basically all you need to know to not get caught.
<br>
<br>http://www.deny.de (HamSolo : See comment above)
<br>
<br>- Text section, basically anything on proxys or anonymity. If it gets too complex then don't worry. It will be explained in my next lesson. The same site also has a good help forum for you to ask questions as well as support for Access Diver and Goldeneye. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Part 5 – Safety and Anonimity – 
<br>
<br>Intro:
<br>
<br>- Some of you might be sitting there saying, "I'm in front of my PC, who the hell is going to find me here?" Well in one sense you are quite right but in another totally wrong. As you surf the Internet, everywhere you go you leave bits of information about yourself and traces of your activities. It is quite easy to gain the IP, quite often the ISP, browser configuration etc… of a person surfing a page. Now especially if your doing things that might be considered illegal in some countries, you don't want to leave all this information behind. This information can easily be used to track you. 
<br>
<br>- This is why during your activities you should take precautions such as those listed below in Part 6 – How to protect yourself - to avoid being caught. To be honest the risk factor is quite low. If you use anonymous proxys(defined below) in your attempts, you are sensible and don't do anything too stupid then the chances of you getting caught are virtually non-existent. Even if you were caught, the chances of you being convicted of computer crime is about as likely as a hooker giving back your money afterwards. It comes down to one thing, this could quite possibly get you into trouble, but as long as you don't do anything stupid and you are careful, you'll be fine.
<br>
<br>
<br>Part 6 – How to protect yourself –
<br>
<br>Introduction:
<br>
<br>- There are quite a lot of essays that have already been written on proxys. I will provide you with the information that you will need however I know that there are always people who want to go a step further. I suggest reading all the essays in the text section of www.deny.de on proxys. Some of them go very in-depth. Knowledge is power, the more knowledge you gather the better hacker you will become. 
<br>
<br>What is a proxy?: 
<br>- Well a proxy is a cache between you and the Internet. That means that you don't directly communicate to the Internet. You communicate through the proxy. If it is an anonymous proxy then the site that you are communicating with cannot recognise you or your ISP, only the proxy. There are huge advantages in using a proxy, during your attempts it is mandatory.
<br>
<br>The errors you will get:
<br>
<br>- A lot of sites nowadays have protections that will forbid(403) your proxy after 'x' amount of attempts. However in programs like Goldeneye you can set 'proxy rotation' that will change the proxy after 'x' attempts. That is, with a list of say 20 anonymous proxys, set the rotation to 100, you can easily move through a wordlist of 2000 words without your attempts being forbidden. 
<br>
<br>- When your attempts are forbidden, it doesn't matter if the pass is correct or incorrect, it automatically calls a forbidden(403). Quite often this goes hand in hand with soon after giving redirections or fake passes where the site accepts any login from your proxy or IP and automatically redirects you, usually straight back to their main page or join page. 
<br>
<br>- By using an anonymous proxy you are both staying anonymous and gain the advantage through your ability to rotate proxys after a certain amount of attempts. Here are a couple of proxy lists that you can use. There are a lot of lists out there, many are outdated and it is quite hard to find good ones that are updated often. A good idea is trying the phrase 'Anonymous proxy list' in a search engine. 
<br>
<br>
<br>Testing proxys:
<br>
<br>- There are quite a number of ****** scripts as well as programs that test the level of anonymity of your proxys. The way that I test mine is through Goldeneye. Import a list of all the proxys that you have gathered then select 'Tools', 'Proxy Tester'. Put the speed bar to the maximum, select 'Towerofbabel' from the script list and click the little globe in the bottom left of the program screen to start testing.
<br>
<br>- This might take some time depending on the proxys and your connection. All secure proxys will come up with a little icon of a lock next to them. These are the ones that you want. Delete all non-secure proxys, you now hopefully have a good list of anonymous proxys to make attempts with. Also if you click the little clock it will sort your proxys by speed. It is a good idea to use the fastest available first.
<br>
<br>
<br>Part 7 – Wordlists –
<br>
<br>Introduction:
<br>
<br>- I hope that everyone learns a lot. In previous lessons I have introduced you to the tools that you will use, explained the basics of staying anonymous as well as some terms that are commonly used. I assume that you have already attempted to hack various sites, most likely without huge success. In this essay we will move deep into the building, maintenance and refinement of highly effective wordlists. You will find that your personal wordlists will prove highly effective as compared to using ones leeched from password sites. Whether you're an absolute newbie following through my lessons or a hacker of some experience, I'm sure that there is something here for everyone in the form of good wordlist habits.
<br>
<br>Clarification of what we are actually attempting to do:
<br>
<br>- Theoretically we are guessing people's login names and passwords. Practically however we are able to make so many attempts in a short period of time that quite often it is relatively easy to 'guess' someone's login and password. The weakness of Basic Authentication on the Internet is that there is no limit to the number of attempts you can make at guessing a login and password. True there are measures now that will forbid(403) your proxy after a certain amount of attempts, however in most cases you are able to make as many attempts as you like. It is because of this weakness and one other that it is relatively easy to guess passwords. The other weakness is at the hand of the user that has signed up for membership to the particular site. Quite often people choose passwords that are easy for them to remember such as 1234, password, cat, dog, qwerty. These make it easy, yet not as easy as my favourite type of passwords, where the login and password join to form a famous person, place or common phrase. For example mickey:mouse, sydney:australia, monica:swallows. One of the lists that you build yourself will contain as many possible combination like this that you can think of. In summary; what we are attempting to achieve is to build well maintained wordlists that will contain enough combinations to get you hits on a lot of sites.
<br>
<br>Leeching:
<br>
<br>- I suggest that the first list you should build is a leech list. The best leeching program currently available is called Bugs Bunny. It comes with a list of password posting sites that it will automatically extract the password combinations from with the click of a button. Once this is finished you will have your first wordlist, save this list to a .txt file called 'Leech List'. Every couple of days or so you should update this list by re- extracting passes using Bugs Bunny. You should also add other password sites to it to increase the variety of passwords extracted. This list can be effective, however you have to realise that basically every hacker in the world has these same passwords in their lists, so the chances that those passwords have already been hacked are increased.
<br>
<br>Combo list:
<br>
<br>This is the list that I spoke briefly about before. This list will contain all the possible combinations that you think people will use for their logins and passwords. The list can be formatted in two ways, with a colon( between login and password or a Tab space. I suggest the use of the colon(. Add to this list continually as you think of new possibilities. Don't be surprised if this list grows to a couple of hundred combinations rather quickly, mine is over 5000. In the end your list will resemble something of the form:
<br>
<br>abraham:lincoln
<br>
<br>martin:luther
<br>
<br>donald:duck
<br>
<br>disney:land
<br>
<br>And so on.
<br>
<br>- Trust me when I say that no combination is too obscure. If you feel that someone out there is using it then chances are they are. Save this list as a .txt file called 'Personal List'. 
<br>
<br>Hit List:
<br>
<br>- This list will become your highly effective and refined 'Hit' list. Every time you crack a password to a site, add the password to this list. Don't be impatient, this list will grow gradually and you will find that for sites where the number of attempts you have is limited as well as on any site this list will be the first you use and will get you the most hits. Don't enter into it passwords of pass sites, only the combinations that you have cracked or passwords that you have received from other people. What this list will become is a list of people's combinations where the same people most probably use that same combination on a variety of sites (often with the same theme, ie: all are 'Teen' sites, etc…) Later on when you become more experienced this can lead to categorisation of lists depending on themes, however for now just focus on what is here.
<br>
<br>Single List:
<br>
<br>- A single list is exactly that, a list of single passwords. You should attempt to build different sized single lists. Personally I have one of around 2000 really common logins and passwords, one of 10,000 fairly common and one of 70,000 passwords which is my 'Mega' single list. It is really up to you how you construct these, with what words and the like. I don't expect you to type out 70,000 words, my list has just grown from a lot of lists that I have joined together over time. There are quite a lot of good wordlists available already on the web, some are listed below: 
<br>
<br>- The use of these lists is rather simple. Imagine for a moment a site that has 5000 members. If this site allows the user to enter the same word for his login and password then on average around 250 passwords will be in the form james:james. Around another 100 will be in the form james:james1. Various other forms will be james:james69, james:semaj james:JAMES etc… Quite a lot of people use variations of their login as their password. If the site allows the entry of the same word as login and password then a very highly effective technique is to run your single lists in this form. That is your single list will run through trying the same word as login and password for all the words in the list. In Goldeneye this is accomplished by choosing 'Options', 'Use Single Lists'. Then you need to click on the two notepads and select the SAME list for each one. In Ares this is accomplished similarly. Also of those 5000 members, at least 10 will use the password 1234. If your combo lists from above don't prove effective then I suggest running a single list as logins and the word 1234 as the password. If this still does not gain you a hit then try other really common passwords like qwerty, asdf, 4321, fuck, sex, cat, dog, pass etc… 
<br>
<br>Maintenance:
<br>
<br>- It is important to attend to your lists regularly. Your leech list needs to be updated frequently. You need to continue to add to your Personal Combo List as well as all the passwords you gain to your single lists and your hits to your Hit List. A very good idea is to swap password lists with other hackers. If you are already friendly with them organise a swap, then everyone benefits because you both extend your wordlists. A very good tool for maintaining your wordlists is called Raptor. Madmax has recently released Raptor II. This program is an extremely fast and reliable tool that you will find yourself using repeatedly to build specific lists for sites as well maintaining your existing lists. Your lists will inevitably contain duplicates of the same password, Raptor II removes these dupes with barely any effort at all. Raptor will sort your lists alphabetically and provide you with numerous options to make alterations to your wordlists such as adding a '1' to the end of the password or '69' etc.... It is best if you explore this program by yourself. For now don't worry about the various AVS or ALS generators that are included. These are bonuses of the wonderful program that I will cover in a future essay.
<br>
<br>Final Words:
<br>
<br>- Now that you have created your lists don't forget that it is essential that you continue to build and maintain them. Every day I have a good habit of spending time working solely on my wordlists. Wordlists are what will get you hits in the end. The better refined and maintained your lists are the better hacker you will become because the more hits you will receive. In the end it comes down to a good imagination and extreme amounts of patience. Keep practicing and soon I will be discussing more techniques and more advanced examples.
<br>
<br>Part 8 – Settings off the tools –
<br>
<br>Introduction: 
<br>
<br>- In this lesson you will be taught the basic use of brute force hacking programs such as Ares, Goldeneye and Webcracker. I am assuming that you have already read my previous two lessons, you have downloaded these programs and that you have a verified list of anonymous proxys ready to go. I will cover basic functions only in this lesson in order to get you started and to help you get the feel of things. As I continue into more complex items I will start to mention other features of these programs and how to use them. You will learn the art of wordlist refinement in my next lesson so in order to test that you have setup the programs correctly and for your experimentation purposes I have included a ready made wordlist of mine. So let's begin.
<br>
<br>Tools: 
<br>
<br>- As I have previously stated, the two most basic programs available are Ares and Webcracker. Ares is simple because it does a lot of the work practically for you. Webcracker is simple because it has very few options to configure. I think that Ares is a good program to begin with however you should try both and then you decide which suits you best.
<br>
<br>
<br>Where to put what: 
<br>
<br>- The member's URL is the URL or address of the entrance to the 'protected' section of the site that you are attempting to gain access to. For now you should stick to Basic Authentication. Basic Authentication is the standard that you will find on the Internet. It is the one that most adult sites use and really the weakest as far as security is concerned. It simply put, is the one where when you click 'members' it pops up a little gray box asking you for a User Name and Password. Other protections like the password entry to Hotmail where you have actual boxes on the html page to enter the data are known as form logins. These are a bit more complicated and will be covered later. Anyway in order to gain access to a site, you need to have a protected URL to enter into the program that you are using. 
<br>
<br>- The simplest way is to go to the site you are about to attempt, right click on the 'members' link. Copy shortcut. Then click on the link to make sure that the box pops up. The reason you need to do this is because some sites when you click this link will simply take you to another page that you have to click on a completely different URL to enter the members area. This was started in order to deter newbie hackers that try the first URL without realising. Every password works for it, they get 1000 hits and wonder "what the hell?" so they move on. Anyway once you have the URL where the box actually pops up, you have completed step 2. You have your proxys from step 1.
<br>
<br>- With every release Ares gets better and better, it does a lot of the work for you and I feel it is one of the best programs that I have used. With future updates I feel that this program will become the top choice of most hackers. 
<br>
<br>- You have your URL and your list of proxys. To enter the proxy list into Ares, click 'Proxy Settings' then the little '+'. Cut and paste your proxy list. Ares has a good verifier as well; you could even have verified your proxys here in step 1. Well with Ares, you have a URL and a proxy, all you need is a wordlist and your ready to go. Under 'User', select 'combo list' then choose your wordlist using the file dialog box below. Under 'Pass' select none. Done. Well now all you have to do is press play and you have started hacking. 
<br>
<br>- Webcracker Webcracker is also easy to setup and has a nice Graphical User Interface. Simply once again paste the member's URL into the program, select your wordlist, 'use combo file.' Now go to 'advanced', select 'use proxy' and enter a single proxy and the port. This is where Webcracker looses its functionality, in its inability to use multiple proxys. Just below the proxy you are able to select the 'number of threads'. This is how many attempts should run simultaneously. On 56kb dialup I recommend no more than 60. Once you have done that, click the 'start' button and your away hacking as well.
<br>
<br>- Goldeneye Currently the most functional brute force program available is Goldeneye. Goldeneye has a lot of options that will be used in later more complex hacking. Some features that for various sites are necessary. To use it, simply paste the member's URL into the text box. Select the wordlist you wish to use. Then click on 'Options', 'Proxy'. Here you are able to add and delete proxys and are also able to select the proxy that you currently want to use. I strongly suggest that you select to 'change proxy on error.' Once all that is setup, simply click the little networking symbol in the top left corner of the program screen and you are away
<br>
<br>Last words off the writer:
<br>
<br>- As you can see these programs are very easy to use. After experimenting with a lot of sites though you will come across many that have various protections that require more than just a proxy and a wordlist. Some require really good or well refined wordlists to get a single hit. The next lesson that I write will cover in full; creation and maintenance of good wordlists. Until then, your homework is to practice and practice some more. Just about everything that I've learnt I have taught myself from pure experimentation. Experimentation doesn't mean being stupid or careless. Just have fun. Next lesson you will learn to refine your wordlists so you'll be getting hits all over the place.
<br>
<br>P.S. Hacking is illegal and if they want, they can catch you. Not even the best proxy can hide you. Like I said earlier. There are logs all over the internet. Remember - don’t do stupid things. I hope that even as a newbie, you know what stupid things are.
<br>
<br>THE END

I'll tell you something loki after reading some of these tutorials, they aren't really saying anything new.  Reading Fravia's site especially the anonimity parts will really prepare you.  Building proper wordlists on specific targets outside porn is a new field.  Its pretty easy to get a list of user names from lets say academic sites, and using wordlist creators to create a list of possible passwords.  I would love to brainstorm with you ideas and even test some of them.

That's exactly what I have in mind, Veliti.
<br>The KNOWLEDGE is in the porn sites busters forums.
<br>The TARGETS should be both more worthy and more easy (bet with you that a book or museum collection will not have incredibly difficoult alfanumeric rotating passwords).
<br>Once found (passwords or backdoors) we will just have to register their subdirectories at major searchengines as 'please addmy site' URLs.
<br>
<br>As you prolly know, to re-name a whole subdirectory structure is something often thought and seldom done.
<br>
<br>I could also add that Jeff's trick (see Giglio's third classroom) for finding username/passwords combinations can ALREDAY NOW work access wonders, eheh

looking back I think it wasn't quiet finished :)
<br>reading these posts gave me another thought...
<br>
<br>the similarity in a couple of the examples given, or, like bob:bob@
<br>and f+ post about a member trick made me wonder hummmmmmmmmm
<br>
<br><a target=_top href="http://www.google.com/search?num=20&hl=en&safe=off&sa=G&q=%22%2Bwww.altniche.%2Bcom/members/%22"> example:</a>
<br>
<br>the key is ANY domaineName /plus whatever they call their memeber/
<br>
<br>now lets pick that fifth google link (cause i tested it and it does work) and the numbers used in it follow the thoughts of this thread---ie: 444777:777444@ ---the user used the same login and pass so it would be easy to rememebr ...
<br>
<br>well that lead me to think about other things I read in this thread about how people probably use the same pass in lots of places so they can remember it easily
<br>
<br>so what happens if we remove the domainename/member
<br>
<br>and use ONLY <a target=_top href="http://444777:777444@">the logpass?</a>
<br>?...:) we get huge lists of userpasses and who knows maybe with the right combo----we might stumble upon ALL the other places/domaines/ gogg has indexed for a single person/people/repeatedlyuseduserpass that they use to log into; even at other different type sites :) would be great to find a library or two :)
<br>no time to query...
<br>
<br>so I ask myself (after reading your great posts) does <a target=_top href="http://www.google.com/search?num=20&hl=en&q=www.altniche.com%2Fmembers%2F+bob"> a bob:bob really exist?</a>

<br>and you know what ? it works ... time to feed my eyes.
<br>It'll be easier for us to find passwords in our domain. They aren't many hackers trying to penetrate the sites, and releasing huge list of l/p. Look at the post date : "14 Nov 2001" &#33; If it was a porn site, this l/p wouldn't have worked.
<br>
<br>I'm exploring the sites ... maybe i'll found interesting backdoors, or the whole password list :)) (i've one list for a university library to release this weekend)

You can fish lists of l/p with simple queries like : +library +username +password
<br>
<br>In fact, some libraries install pages only for users that access to them in the real library. They don't imagine that their webpages can be indexed by Search Engines. In consequence, you can find some gems like this one :

<br>i feel like a datajunky, flow of data emerging from here and there just by prononcing some KEYwords. 
<br>Strange feeling ... and now?download everything,burn bunch of dataCD, and saying : Knowledge is Power &#33;? 
<br>Like a dragon sitting on his treasure, as someone said in the riddle board. but i won't ever read one percent of these. 
<br>i'd like to, yes, in theory, but i don't wanna be a data sponge ;) By proceding like that, we're going to collect 'random' 
<br>DB, from the library community (not so random ...). It even can be done automagically. 
<br>IMHO it'd be possible to set a bot for fishing all passwords that hides in the sea of information formed by searching inside 'pools' of data. These one can be created by querying ragingsearch like i did. The results are then parsed, and (that's the hard part), a script check in pages if there are relevant keys. Each key is stocked with the door url. And each door can be used to query and create pool. And so on ... 
<br>
<br>But then, what are we going to do with all that keys? 
<br>What is really the most interesting : Having hundred keys and the adress of the door or knowing how to lockpick ? :) 
<br>
<br>---------------- 
<br>
<br>What has be done in the last messages of this thread is just collecting data. No target (exclude the initial one). 
<br>But what was fished can be used to : 
<br>
<br>
<br>build maps (index of cracked database, commented, to create a fast jumping station for seekers)
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>build wordlist and combolist for the bruteforcers
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>have an access in order to 'crack open' and release to the public the hidden information (each site can be indexed out or mirrored or backdoored)
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>have examples of passwords in order to reverse the login algo
<br>
<br>
<br>Let's center a bit on what was requested for searchlores : 
<br>"Hence: your help would be welcome and useful... preparing essays 'synthtetizing' these 'pornpass' knowledges into useful "how to access databases when you have forgotten your password" essays."

<br>i feel like a datajunky, flow of data emerging from here and there just by prononcing some KEYwords.
<br>Strange feeling ... and now?download everything,burn bunch of dataCD, and saying : Knowledge is Power &#33;? 
<br>Like a dragon sitting on his treasure, as someone said in the riddle board. but i won't ever read one percent of these.
<br>i'd like to, yes, in theory, but i don't wanna be a data sponge ;) By proceding like that, we're going to collect 'random' DB, from the library community (not so random ...). It even can be done automagically. 
<br>IMHO it'd be possible to set a bot for fishing all passwords that hides in the sea of information formed by searching inside 'pools' of data. These one can be created by querying ragingsearch like i did. The results are then parsed, and (that's the hard part), a script check in pages if there are relevant keys. Each key is stocked with the door url. And each door can be used to query and create pool. And so on ...
<br> 
<br>But then, what are we going to do with all that keys?
<br>What is really the most interesting : Having hundred keys and the adress of the door or knowing how to lockpick ? :) 
<br>
<br><hr>
<br>
<br>What has be done in the last messages of this thread is just collecting data. No target (exclude the initial one). 
<br>But what was fished can be used to :
<br><ul>
<br><li> build maps (index of cracked database, commented, to create a fast jumping station for seekers)</li>
<br><li> build wordlist and combolist for the bruteforcers</li>
<br><li> have an access in order to 'crack open' and release to the public the hidden information (each site can be indexed out or mirrored or backdoored). </li>
<br><li> have examples of passwords in order to reverse the login algo</li>
<br></ul>
<br>
<br>Let's center on what was required for searchlores :
<br><i>"Hence: your help would be welcome and useful... preparing essays 'synthtetizing' these 'pornpass' knowledges into useful "how to access databases when you have forgotten your password" essays."</i>
<br>
<br>At that time, i never had to use bruteforce engine and worldlists (but i have read tutorials, and therefore i could use them if needed). In fact, gaining access to a porn site is far more difficult than accessing online librairies :)

</td><td align=right></td></tr><tr><td><ul>
let's try to resume what was written, into a simple combing 'trick' for accessing databases.
<br><center>--------</center>
<br><ul>
<br><li>Find out the url where is located the login form or, if it uses an .htaccess protection scheme (see at searchlore <a target=_top href="http://www.searchlores.org/passwo22.htm">"~ Authentication & Authorization lore for Apache servers ~"</a> for more on that subject) the protected directory. This is also the first step for bruteforcing a site.</li>
<br><li>Prepare queries using the url and keywords found on the target site, like how they name their variables (username, user name, user-name, user ID, ID ARE different keywords).</li>
<br><li>Launch search engines or scrolls :
<br>
<br>-    use the "link:" option to find sites that POINT to the target (remember that it usually doesn't work with metasearchengines and a lot of classic search engines) 
<br>-    use the plain url to find sites that only print the url (they use the both usually)
<br>-    filter the results with keywords</li>
<br></ul>
<br>This way you'll fish mostly bookmarks where someone has written in PLAIN TEXT his login information. It is frequently the case for libraries, has we have seen earlier. They write all the identification informations on a web page, and thinks it'll be seen only by users of their internal computers. But they forgot the spiders ... :)
<br>
<br>Moreover, when you've grabbed a valid access, if the protection scheme is really weak, using this weakness as keywords can produce wonderfull results : remember the Proquest case.
<br><center>--------</center>
<br>That's all. I think it somehow resumes what was written in my last posts in a simple searching algorithm. A trick.

nice essay &#33;
<br>
<br>now, about the 'crack open' thing. what if we set a page with links like :
<br>http://07SNXJX2C9:WELCOME@www.bellhowell.infolearning.com/proquest 
<br>
<br>and submit it to Search Engines. Will they follow the links and index all the data which is hidden to the nucleus ? What about the robots.txt ?

Hummm .. that's an idea. if we take Proquest as an example, your link won't work. 
<br>Checking the sources where we have find the <a target=_top href="http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?RQT=341">form</a>
<br>(i take the interesting snippet)
<br>
<br>form method="POST" action="/pqdweb" onSubmit=" return Check4Blank();"
<br>input type="hidden" name="RQT" value="301"
<br>input type="hidden" name="TS" value="1011333342"
<br>input type="text" name="UserId"
<br>input type="password" name="Passwd"
<br>
<br>So, now we can build a valid url : 
<br>
<br>http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?RQT=341&UserId=07SNXJX2C9&Passwd=WELCOME
<br>
<br>And it works. 
<br>http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?RQT=341&UserId=[USERNAME HERE]&Passwd=WELCOME is the url we would need to use in order to
<br>bruteforce the site. Using the appropriate tool, the UserId will be changed to all possible combinaison of 10 characters taken in {A..Z;0..9}. that does : (26+10)^10 = 3.656.158.440.062.976 possibilities (if i don't make a mistake). Hmm, i don't know ... is that possible ? :)
<br>  
<br>(what about RQT ? it has a value set at 341, and the form change it to 341 ...
<br>
<br>But :
<br>
<br>http://proquest.umi.com/robots.txt
<br>User-agent: *
<br>Disallow: /
<br>
<br>So, i think a bot won't index it. But maybe i'm wrong, we need to check.

<br>Dunnow how long this cutting road will remain open for us once published, maybe for ever, maybe just for some months. Would be worth having a look at regional search engines. If they perform the same tricks we'll be able to reopen all dragon caves whenever they close them.

We could apply here the trick that DQ already implemented some time ago, with his dynproxy script. He could probably explain better than me, but the trick is to point the search engine to a page of your which will transparently act like if it was your target page. For example, www.2113.ch/phplab/dynproxy.php/pqdweb?RQT=341&UserId=07SNXJX2C9&Passwd=WELCOME would actually fetch http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?RQT=341&UserId=07SNXJX2C9&Passwd=WELCOME and return it to the spider. All relative links would point to your script and so the spider could easily follow them, always passing through your script.
<br>
<br>This way we can easily avoid the robots.txt exclusion and get those page indexed (and cached &#33;&#33;). 
<br>
<br>As far as I know the results of DQ experiments were by far positive.
<br>
<br>You do a wonderful work guys &#33;&#33;

Fortunately I live in the states where internet access is at every University Library for free, thus tracking who exactly I am is not that easy, but the real reason for proxys is that you don't want any automated script on your target site to notice the same ip being rejected 100's of times.  Of course even using a new proxy every lets say three times will get you noticed if you try to accomplish your attack in just one day.  My advice would be to categorize your target based on the estimated number of members, vistors; thus you can use your own common sense in determining how noticable you will be trampling around in their front yard.  Also some of these automated scripts will shoot off fake passwords(will accept your wrong password) in order to track you so slowing down your attempts will also keep you alive for a little longer.

hi loki a wonderful work you are doing (fun isn't it?? :) :)
<br>
<br>just a few extras to add to your already great list... some of these are repeats
<br>as we know some people have user/pass out in the open and the tricks are to create keywords 
<br>to capture them... and one bread crumb leads to another
<br>
<br>I will refrain from hyper links here (sorry)
<br><font color=blue>line broken, rebuild it</font> 
<br>http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:G5G2uBqcAC8C:homework.syosset.k12.ny.us
<br>/onlinedbs/HBTDatabases/+%2Blibrary+%2Busername+%2Bpassword+sirs&hl=en
<br>
<br>it seemed to me while glancing at the returns another idea hit me...
<br>Notice in your sirs returns that the USER begins "NY#####" well while looking 
<br>at this page (at googles above url at the 5th link): <font color=blue>line broken, rebuild it</font> 
<br>http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:G5G2uBqcAC8C:homework.syosset.k12.ny.us
<br>/onlinedbs/HBTDatabases/+%2Blibrary+%2Busername+%2Bpassword+sirs&hl=en
<br>
<br>(more userpasses :) however my point (sorry)
<br>.............at the very last link at CERF it says...New York State standards
<br>N Y......New York? a new York User-Number? would that then mean that california would have CA#####...?
<br>
<br>http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%2Blibrary+%2Busername+%2Bpassword+sirs+CA
<br>
<br>yep&#33; :) ...seems to be a california and a massachuttes number on the first page.... 
<br>now i am having no luck accessing sirs as it kicks me out as recognizing my ip 
<br>(oooppss) but the resources in googles returns have lots more userpasses to other 
<br>places as my bonus :)
<br><font color=blue>line broken, rebuild it</font> 
<br>(http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:5OZy1PfS59kC:web.aacpl.lib.md.us
<br>/bestsites/magazines.htm+%2Blibrary+%2Busername+%2Bpassword+proquest+Welcome&hl=en)
<br>
<br>ahh... so we get proved correct in this above case...this person has the 
<br>same usernamepass at many sites&#33; (I tested one and got thru...
<br>http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?RQT=306&TS=1011372558)
<br>
<br>I see where you got that RQT now at least loki :)
<br>.............http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=+site:proquest.umi.com+RQT%3D
<br>notquiet sure what all that is but looks like 341 gets in...same as above 
<br>one though...heres a different number though; goes to an author search page
<br>http://tpdweb.umi.com/tpweb?RQT=810&TS=1011382089
<br>using the search gave me returns... so seems to work
<br>
<br>so if we now search for the userpass
<br>
<br>and we get some more lists of access-links
<br>http://206.15.40.17/bestsites/databases.htm
<br>
<br>
<br>can someone double check this one for me...
<br>
<br>am I actually gaining access to sirs; or only some subdivision of it?
<br>http://www.nassaulibrary.org/lynbrook/yourhomedata.html  ... click on the 
<br>hyperlink at the bottom of page which includes a user number to sirs ... 
<br>or go direct to <font color=blue>line broken, rebuild it</font> 
<br>http://sks10.sirs.com/cgi-bin/hst-frontpage?CUSTNUM=NY0433&STARTPAGE=
<br>none&RES=Y&WCN=N&LNK=N&REN=N&GOV=N&DIS=N&T=1011379935&C=1879448903
<br>
<br> looks like maybe access to me..?? .the links work anyway...some more url 
<br>words to play with though eh loki? :)
<br>
<br>now that is something to note also... this is the second Library today 
<br>where the user and pass were the NAMES of the Library itself ... this one was 
<br>lynnBrookepl (lynn brooke Public Library) and one above was the Arundel 
<br>Library)... hummm
<br>
<br>barcode library Card numbers... hummmmmm
<br>
<br>so many damned places and users and passes now i can't even seem to begin to begin :)
<br>
<br>just as 'members' was a keyword for p o r n sites
<br>Library (as loki saw) seems to be a great key for schools
<br>
<br>so much to do and so little time
<br>

Looks like its accessing to me, i found a .edu last night that did the same, 
<br>but gave instructions how to do so not just a link. And i think your right 
<br>its all on the username, city/library/college/school, passes are normally simple, 
<br>you search for the usernames below u get the districts using them, so there might 
<br>be a code somewhere, zip mixed with something maybe? I'll look into it more tomorrow.

<br>blablabla@hotmail.com password is ----
<br>then I saw more of them
<br>
<br>yup---- u guessed it ....one of the guys was lazy and used his real account

<br>see roscoe?
<br>not that I tested it but geeeeeeeeeeesh the guy has over 700 porn mails in there whewwww :)

How I found tons of usernames to try on a specific .edu server.<br>
I just got done exploring a great .edu server that only had telnet access.<br>
I used brutus to get in and just guess what kind of information I found :)<br>

I also wanted to create a specific username list for my target.  
So I went and downloaded a program called fast email spider (fesweb.exe v1.09).<br>  
You could find the serial number on the web, but you should buy it. <br>
You can use the spider on Google.  
I used the spider to gather all email addresses of the specific university ie. 
<br>username@YYY.edu <br>Voila! a list of targeted usernames.
