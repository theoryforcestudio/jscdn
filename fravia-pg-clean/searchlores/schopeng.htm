Thirty - Eight Ways to Win an Argument
<br>from Schopenhauer's "The Art of Controversy"<br><br>
<font color=blue><i>...per fas et nefas</i></font>&nbsp;:-)
<br><br></font>(Courtesy of <a href="http://www.searchlores.org">searchlore</a> ~ Back to the <a href="trolls.htm">trolls</a> lore ~ <a href="http://www.rhetorik-netz.de/rhetorik/schopenh.htm">original german text</a>)

</center><hr>
<br><font color=blue size=+2>1</font> Carry your opponent's proposition beyond its natural limits; 
 exaggerate it.<br> The more general your opponent's statement becomes, 
 the more objections you can find against it.<br> The more restricted 
 and narrow your own propositions remain, the easier they are to 
 defend.<br>
  <br><font color=blue size=+2>2</font> Use different meanings of your opponent's words to refute his 
  argument.<br> Example: Person A says, "You do not understand the
  mysteries of Kant's philosophy."<br> Person B replies, "Of, if it's 
  mysteries you're talking about, I'll have nothing to do with them."<br> 
  <br><font color=blue size=+2>3</font> Ignore your opponent's proposition, which was intended to refer 
  to some particular thing.<br> Rather, understand it in some quite different sense, 
  and then refute it.<br> Attack something different than what was asserted.<br> 
  <br><font color=blue size=+2>4</font> Hide your conclusion from your opponent until the end.<br> Mingle 
  your premises here and there in your talk.<br> Get your opponent to 
  agree to them in no definite order.<br> By this circuitous route you 
  conceal your goal until you have reached all the admissions 
  necessary to reach your goal.<br> 
  <br><font color=blue size=+2>5</font> Use your opponent's beliefs against him.<br> If your opponent 
  refuses to accept your premises, use his own premises to your advantage.<br> 
  Example, if the opponent is a member of an organization 
  or a religious sect to which you do not belong, you may employ the
  declared opinions of this group against the opponent.<br> 
  <br><font color=blue size=+2>6</font> Confuse the issue by changing your opponent's words or what he 
  or she seeks to prove.<br> Example: Call something by a different 
  name: "good repute" instead of "honor," "virtue" instead of
  "virginity," "red-blooded" instead of "vertebrates".<br> 
  <br><font color=blue size=+2>7</font> State your proposition and show the truth of it by asking the
  opponent many questions.<br> By asking many wide-reaching questions at 
  once, you may hide what you want to get admitted.<br> Then you quickly 
  propound the argument resulting from the proponent's admissions.<br> 
  <br><font color=blue size=+2>8</font> Make your opponent angry.<br> An angry person is less capable of
  using judgment or perceiving where his or her advantage lies.<br>
  <br><font color=blue size=+2>9</font> Use your opponent's answers to your question to reach different 
  or even opposite conclusions.<br> 
  <br><font color=blue size=+2>10</font> If you opponent answers all your questions negatively and 
  refuses to grant you any points, ask him or her to concede the opposite 
  of your premises.<br> This may confuse the opponent as to 
  which point you actually seek him to concede.<br> 
  <br><font color=blue size=+2>11</font> If the opponent grants you the truth of some of your premises, 
  refrain from asking him or her to agree to your conclusion.<br> Later, 
  introduce your conclusions as a settled and admitted fact.<br> Your 
  opponent and others in attendance may come to believe that your 
  conclusion was admitted.<br> 
  <br><font color=blue size=+2>12</font> If the argument turns upon general ideas with no particular 
  names, you must use language or a metaphor that is favorable to 
  your proposition.<br> Example: What an impartial person would call 
  "public worship" or a "system of religion" is described by an adherent 
  as "piety" or "godliness" and by an opponent as "bigotry" 
  or "superstition."<br> In other words, inset what you intend to prove 
  into the definition of the idea.<br> 
  <br><font color=blue size=+2>13</font> To make your opponent accept a proposition , you must give him 
  an opposite, counter-proposition as well.<br> If the contrast is 
  glaring, the opponent will accept your proposition to avoid being 
  paradoxical.<br> Example: If you want him to admit that a boy must to 
  everything that his father tells him to do, ask him, "whether in 
  all things we must obey or disobey our parents."<br> Or , if a thing 
  is said to occur "often" you are to understand few or many times, 
  the opponent will say "many." <br>It is as though you were to put gray 
  next to black and call it white; or gray next to white and call it 
  black.<br> 
  <br><font color=blue size=+2>14</font> Try to bluff your opponent.<br> If he or she has answered several 
  of your question without the answers turning out in favor of your 
  conclusion, advance your conclusion triumphantly, even if it does 
  not follow.<br> If your opponent is shy or stupid, and you yourself 
  possess a great deal of impudence and a good voice, the technique 
  may succeed.<br> 
  <br><font color=blue size=+2>15</font> If you wish to advance a proposition that is difficult to 
  prove, put it aside for the moment.<br> Instead, submit for your opponent's 
  acceptance or rejection some true proposition, as though 
  you wished to draw your proof from it.<br> Should the opponent reject 
  it because he suspects a trick, you can obtain your triumph by 
  showing how absurd the opponent is to reject an obviously true 
  proposition.<br> Should the opponent accept it, you now have reason on 
  your side for the moment.<br> You can either try to prove your 
  original proposition, as in #14, maintain that your original 
  proposition is proved by what your opponent accepted.<br> For this an 
  extreme degree of impudence is required, but experience shows cases 
  of it succeeding.<br> 
  <br><font color=blue size=+2>16</font> When your opponent puts forth a proposition, find it 
  inconsistent with his or her other statements, beliefs, actions or 
  lack of action.<br> Example: Should your opponent defend suicide, you 
  may at once exclaim, "Why don't you hang yourself?"<br> Should the opponent 
  maintain that his city is an unpleasant place to live, you 
  may say, "Why don't you leave on the first plane?"<br> 
  <br><font color=blue size=+2>17</font> If your opponent presses you with a counter-proof, you will 
  often be able to save yourself by advancing some subtle distinction.<br> 
  Try to find a second meaning or an ambiguous sense 
  for your opponent's idea.<br> 
  <br><font color=blue size=+2>18</font> If your opponent has taken up a line of argument that will end 
  in your defeat, you must not allow him to carry it to its conclusion.<br> 
  Interrupt the dispute, break it off altogether, or 
  lead the opponent to a different subject.<br> 
  <br><font color=blue size=+2>19</font> Should your opponent expressly challenge you to produce any 
  objection to some definite point in his argument, and you have 
  nothing to say, try to make the argument less specific.<br> Example: 
  If you are asked why a particular hypothesis cannot be accepted, 
  you may speak of the fallibility of human knowledge, and give
  various illustrations of it.<br> 
  <br><font color=blue size=+2>20</font> If your opponent has admitted to all or most of your premises, 
  do not ask him or her directly to accept your conclusion.<br> Rather, 
  draw the conclusion yourself as if it too had been admitted.<br> 
  <br><font color=blue size=+2>21</font>  When your opponent uses an argument that is superficial and you see 
  the falsehood, you can refute it by setting forth its superficial 
  character.<br>
  But it is better to meet the opponent with acounter-argument that is just 
  as superficial, and so dispose of him.<br> For 
  it is with victory that you are concerned, not with truth.<br> 
  Example: If the opponent appeals to prejudice, emotion or attacks you 
  personally, return the attack in the same manner.<br> 
  <br><font color=blue size=+2>22</font>  If your opponent asks you to admit something from which the point in 
  dispute will immediately follow, you
  must refuse to do so, declaring that it begs the question.<br> 
  <br><font color=blue size=+2>23</font>  Contradiction and contention irritate a person into exaggerating 
  their statements.<br> By contradicting your
  opponent you may drive him into extending the statement beyond its 
  natural limit.<br> When you then contradict
  the exaggerated form of it, you look as though you had refuted the
  original statement.<br> Contrarily, if your
  opponent tries to extend your own statement further than your intended, 
  redefine your statement's limits and
  say, "That is what I said, no more." <br>
  <br><font color=blue size=+2>24</font>  State a false syllogism.<br> Your opponent makes a proposition, and by 
  false inference and distortion of his
  ideas you force from the proposition other propositions that are not 
  intended and that appear absurd.<br> It then
  appears that opponent's proposition gave rise to these inconsistencies, 
  and so appears to be indirectly refuted.<br>
  <br><font color=blue size=+2>25</font>  If your opponent is making a generalization, find an instance to the
  contrary.<br> Only one valid contradiction
  is needed to overthrow the opponent's proposition.<br> Example: "All 
  ruminants are horned," is a generalization
  that may be upset by the single instance of the camel.<br> 
  <br><font color=blue size=+2>26</font>  A brilliant move is to turn the tables and use your opponent's 
  arguments against himself.<br> Example: Your
  opponent declares: "so and so is a child, you must make an allowance for 
  him."<br> You retort, "Just because he is
  a child, I must correct him; otherwise he will persist in his bad habits."<br> 
  <br><font color=blue size=+2>27</font>  Should your opponent suprise you by becoming particularly angry at an 
  argument, you must urge it with all
  the more zeal.<br> No only will this make your opponent angry, but it will 
  appear that you have put your finger on
  the weak side of his case, and your opponent is more open to attack on 
  this point than you expected.<br> 
  <br><font color=blue size=+2>28</font>  When the audience consists of individuals (or a person) who is not an 
  expert on a subject, you make an
  invalid objection to your opponent who seems to be defeated in the eyes 
  of the audience.<br> This strategy is
  particularly effective if your objection makes your opponent look 
  ridiculous or if the audience laughs.<br> If your
  opponent must make a long, winded and complicated explanation to correct 
  you, the audience will not be
  disposed to listen to him.<br> 
  <br><font color=blue size=+2>29</font>  If you find that you are being beaten, you can create a 
  diversion--that is, you can suddenly begin to talk of
  something else, as though it had a bearing on the matter in dispute.<br> This 
  may be done without presumption if the diversion has some general bearing on the matter.<br> 
  <br><font color=blue size=+2>30</font>  Make an appeal to authority rather than reason.<br> If your opponent 
  respects an authority or an expert,
  quote that authority to further your case.<br> If needed, quote what the
  authority said in some other sense or
  circumstance.<br> Authorities that your opponent fails to understand are 
  those which he generally admires the
  most.<br> You may also, should it be necessary, not only twist your 
  authorities, but actually falsify them, or quote
  something that you have entirely invented yourself.<br> 
  <br><font color=blue size=+2>31</font> If you know that you have no reply to the arguments that your 
  opponent advances, you by a find stroke of
  irony declare yourself to be an incompetent judge.<br> Example: "What you say 
  passes my poor powers of
  comprehension; it may well be all very true, but I can't understand it, 
  and I refrain from any expression of
  opinion on it."<br> In this way you insinuate to the audience, with whom you 
  are in good repute, that what your
  opponent says is nonsense.<br> This technique may be used only when you are 
  quite sure that the audience thinks
  much better of you than your opponent.<br> 
  <br><font color=blue size=+2>32</font> A quick way of getting rid of an opponent's assertion, or of throwing 
  suspicion on it, is by putting it into
  some odious category.<br> Example: You can say, "That is fascism" or 
  "Atheism" or "Superstition."<br> In making an
  objection of this kind you take for granted<br> 1)That the assertion or 
  question is identical with, or at least
  contained in, the category cited; <br>and <br>2)The system referred to has been 
  entirely refuted by the current audience.<br> 
  <br><font color=blue size=+2>33</font> You admit your opponent's premises but deny the conclusion.<br> Example: 
  "That's all very well in theory, but
  it won't work in practice." <br>
  <br><font color=blue size=+2>34</font> When you state a question or an argument, and your opponent gives you 
  no direct answer, or evades it
  with a counter question, or tries to change the subject, it is sure sign 
  you have touched a weak spot,
  sometimes without intending to do so.<br> You have, as it were, reduced your 
  opponent to silence.<br> You must,
  therefore, urge the point all the more, and not let your opponent evade 
  it, even when you do not know where
  the weakness that you have hit upon really lies.<br> 
  <br><font color=blue size=+2>35</font> Instead of working on an opponent's intellect or the rigor of his 
  arguments, work on his motive.<br> If you
  success in making your opponent's opinion, should it prove true, seem 
  distinctly prejudicial to his own interest,
  he will drop it immediately.<br> Example: A clergyman is defending some 
  philosophical dogma.<br> You show him that
  his proposition contradicts a fundamental doctrine of his church.<br> He will 
  abandon the argument.<br> 
  <br><font color=blue size=+2>36</font> You may also puzzle and bewilder your opponent by mere bombast.<br> If 
  your opponent is weak or does
  not wish to appear as if he has no idea what your are talking about, you 
  can easily impose upon him some
  argument that sounds very deep or learned, or that sounds indisputable.<br> 
  <br><font color=blue size=+2>37</font> Should your opponent be in the right but, luckily for you, choose a 
  faulty proof, you can easily refute it and
  then claim that you have refuted the whole position.<br> This is the way in 
  which bad advocates lose good cases.<br>
  If no accurate proof occurs to your opponent, you have won the day.<br> 
  <br><font color=blue size=+2>38</font> Become personal, insulting and rude as soon as you perceive that your 
  opponent has the upper hand.<br> In
  becoming personal you leave the subject altogether, and turn your attack 
  on the person by remarks of an
  offensive and spiteful character.<br> This is a very popular technique, 
  because it takes so little skill to put it into
  effect.<br>
