An <a href="evalessa.htm">evaluating essay</a>, part of the  <a href="evaluate.htm">evaluating results</a> 
lore. <br><hr width=55%><i>Well... what should I say? This is an interesting read for any seeker. 
For sure: this soi-disant 'blogger' is a easy debunking target, 
a real 'sitting duck silhouette' in front of the 'linkfarmscape'. In fact, the title of this 
essay could have been "<font color=blue>Marcus P. Zillman, M.S., A.M.H.A: the snake oil seller</font>", but 
 after all not everything is that bad: some people may really like his videos, they can be funny  and
would probably even be really suitable for kids (if he would promote his
own linkfarms a little bit less).
<br>
<br>Anyway 
  this short essay is 
in fact just a quick note. Yet this tiny messageboard discussion  may result 
 pretty useful for 
 more global  <a href="evaluate.htm">evaluation skills</a> purposes. At the same time -and this is the point of the exercise- 
 this discussion 
 underlines 
 <font color=blue>the sad degeneration of google's defenses</font> against spammers and 
 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_farm">linkfarmers</a>.</i>

<br><br>
On the World Wide Web, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_farm">link farm</a> is any group of web pages that all hyperlink to every other page in the group. Although some link farms can be created by hand, most are created through automated programs and services. 
A link farm is a form of spamming the index of a search engine (sometimes called spamdexing).<br><br>
On the other hand <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_oil">Snake oil</a> 

is  an expression applied metaphorically 
to any product with exaggerated marketing but questionable or unverifiable quality.
<br><br>

Spam and linkfarming are <i>per se</i> pretty OLD beasts roaming the searchscape.  
<br>
 Of course it has always been necessary to counter with <a href="nemo_SEO.htm">clever counter-measures</a>  
 the most obnoxious practices of dubious <a href="links.htm#SE0beasts">SEOs</a>, low-life
 <font color=blue>link sellers</font> (for a particularly pathetic one see www.linkworth.com), 
 referral and blog comment spammer_slimes and 
other assorted clowns.<br> And countering spammers is exactly what serious search engines ARE (and should be) doing all the time. 
Spammers and Link sellers are not only sworn foes of knowledge spreading, and not only 
bandwidth thieves: they are 
enemies of any good functioning search engine. <font color=blue>Their very purpose is to make everyone's searches 
less useful</font>. They are and should be
rightly penalized -or even better kicked out altogether from the result lists (SERPs).
 They MUST be kicked out: no search engine that cares 
to survive would of course want SERPs full of useless sites.<br>
So far so good, but AS A CONSEQUENCE of this anti-spamming behavior of the main search engines, 
spammers are now more and more masking their spam-offer with semi-legitimate content. 
<br><br>We come back to <font color=blue>link farm</font> and <font color=blue>snake oil</font> dilemma:
the problem, for seekers, is when both aspects  appear indissolubly linked together, because it can 
be time consuming to evaluate properly the <a href="terminology.htm#termi_n">noise</a>/<a href="terminology.htm#termi_s">signal</a> ratio of a given target if it is at the same time BOTH a link farm 
and a snake-oil seller podium. 
<br><br>Techniques must be devised to quickly recognize the ‘snake-oilness’ or the ‘link-farmness’  
of some results of our (or our own <a href="bots.htm">bots</a>’) queries. The higher and higher levels of <font color=blue>google 
spamming</font> (as we will now see, this kind of spamming problems 
 seem less pronounced in other search engines), are getting out of control.<br>
 Who, if not seekers can   
develop them? Witness the following discussion.

<br>
um yea, what is it? did you actually take a look at that page, try to find something useful on it? :) 
<br>
<br>i took a route down the "artificial-intelligence-resources.info", eheh the AI-links shows 20q.net at the top of the list :) .. while a cool funky AI application, i was kind of expecting to find some more serious research.
<br>
<br>it seems to me that this mr zillman is trying to fetch pagerank, hits, blogwhatever, directory and all the rest in order to sell his books (which are, regardless of the subject of the page, linked *everywhere*)
<br>
<br>actually it is getting rather interesting, browsing it more, it really looks like the entire site is completely FAKE and GENERATED :) it almost makes me wonder if the guy actually exists :) :) even his personal blog consists of nothing but a) the logo of a website b) a general description of a website, and all posted *exactly* either at 4.05, 4.10 or 4.15 am ... weeeeird :)
<br>
<br>lol check out his videos at http://www.informationdetective.com/ :) section one, searchengines .. he should teach at kindergarten or something :) "let's go to google.com, that's g-o-o-g-l-e .. search engines are powered by ROBOTS, but we will call them Bots, that's right, we drop the R and the O, in order to make it shorter .. blablablabla" well that's just hilarious :) 
<br>
<br>ok maybe this one of his many lists of links is a bit useful:
<br><a target=_top href="http://deepwebresearch.info/">deepwebresearch.info</a> (making a link of this cause i think it's so far the only thing worthdeepwebresearch.info clicking -- ok also the videos are rather funny, a bit like seekers sesame street :) :) )
<br>
<br>..arg i'm now hearing him advise people to go "intuitive", "just type what 
you're looking for in your browser address bar and add .com, .biz, .info 
(because it gives you IN FOR MA TION *brr*), .edu (yea right that would be shakespeare.edu) etc" .. 
go intuitive people&#33; 
<font color=blue>the way i hear him speak indicates that he's talking to an audience that wouldn't know 
the difference between an ad-infested labyrinth of cybersquatters and the info (without the dot) they're actually looking for</font>.

<br>
<br>after some time you get a feeling for 'templated' sites. even more.. 
In fact <font color=blue>I feel like I can tell after a few second if a page/site is "alive" or "dead"</font>. 'Dead' in the sense 
of automatically generated, without any life whatsoever behind it, <font color=blue>no real 
content, no unique information</font>. Nothing to do with "professional versus amateurs"   
or "new versus old" concepts. 
<br>
An old homepage of Mr.XYZ talking about his dog, not updated for years, still feels alive when you see it. 
More than any of those .info sites (<font color=blue>beware of .info. In itself it's a bad signal already</font>)  
<br>
See what I'm trying to point out?

<br>&gt; I feel like I can tell after a few second if a page/site is "alive" or "dead".
<br>
<br>myeah, i have yet to cultivate such a sense. the more straightforward way, which i used this time:
<br>1) you hit the wall of the frontpage. everything looks interesting, but you don't know where 
to click or to start. you get a feeling this might be templated. (so far it could also 
be searchlores.org ;-) 
<br>2) now the simple acid test is: just <font color=blue>try to find something genuinely useful or interesting on the site.</font>.
<br>If you can't, after a few minutes of clicking around, throw the crap away. 
If you did find something interesting, it's most probably "alive" (and even if it isn't, there's still 
interesting stuff there, which can't make it all bad). Now you separated the searchlores from the informationdetective :) 
<br>
<br>Another indicator is simply if they're trying to sell you anything related to or equal to the information you're trying to find. 
If that's the case, go away because they will usually just tell you only part of the information to wet 
your appetite and you have to pay to get everything (unless of course you're 
looking for something which you don't mind paying for)

<br><br>
First of all, <font color=blue>a tag too many "TM" tags</font> all over the place&nbsp;:-) 
<br>Could be intended to blind TM-loving-zombies and know-nothing dudes into a false sense of 
trust: "<i>if everything is trademarked, everything must be perfectly legal, uh?</i>". As we are seeing, 
this is by far not the case with snake oil sellers. Probably the inverse rule is valid nowadays, 
and TM signs should be avoided&nbsp;:-)<br> Another possibility is that they are used to trick google's algos, see below.
<br>
In fact note at least a dozen TM-signs, many on the side frames, one even inside the title tag :-)<br>
More generally: the use of trademarked signs, patent warnings, copyright histeries and legal mumbo-jumbo, 
 to create an 
<font color=blue>appearence</font> of 'legality' is
 always a great big red 'caution' sign. <br>Usually (but by all means not always) people that really 
 produce ideas or concretely spread  knowledge 
 don't use such kind of approach so extensively (if they use such notifications at all). For evaluation purposes this kind of 
 repetitions are a 
tipical "scammer alarm" and/or "commercial useless site" warning.<br><br>
Second, this guy repeats his own "fame and name" much too much. He makes such a song and dance of 
all that crap that it sounds pretty ridicolous already after a few lines. 
<br><br>
<i>Modus operandi</i> he bought a zillion domains (for criss-cross linkfarming purposes) and has 
 posted <u>2979</u> posts on those (seldom used) blogger <a href="http://www.blogger.com/profile/47420">profiles</a>... geesh.

<br><br>The gratuite  autoreferences to his own pamphlets, the postings signed 'Marcus' on the blogs, are so continuous and overpushed that create 
a sort of solipsistic vertigo.
<br><br>Third: What the quack is actually a 
<font color=blue>M.S., A.M.H.A</font>? There's a whole domain <a href="http://www.zillman.info/">http://www.zillman.info/</a> 
that is supposed to explain us 
that, but it actually does not. As already observed by ritz, it's just repetitive blabbering and boasting, 
without nothing concrete, apart the 
linkfarm itself.
<br>
Searching with google, we discover that the snake seller, -not surprisingly- managed to occupy all positions for 
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=opera&rls=en&q=%22M.S+A.M.H.A%22&sourceid=opera&num=100&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8">M.S., 
A.M.H.A</a>. This increases the already pretty strong impression that both  sigles 
(if they are intended as two 
separate ones - as 
the comma after that "M.S." implies)  
are just pulled from thin air like the rest of the text.
<br> MS <u>could</u> 
mean Master of Science, but for all we know could also mean "Mediocre Spammer"&nbsp;:-)<br> Moreover AMHA could be everything:  
from "American Miniature Horse Association" through "Association of Mental Health Advocates" to "Alma Mater Humanitatis Asinorum".


<br><br>
But fourth, and ever more important, there's this sense of "template uselessness" loki spoke about. A fabric 
structure intrinsically made just to autoreference 
itself, like this one, a bot created merely for self-pushing commercial purposes, 
stinks just as what it is: <font color=blue>a dead bug carcass,  forgotten by some s.e. spiders 
in the middle of the web</font>&nbsp;:-)

<br><br>Alas. 
The interesting lesson from all this is a very sad one: if we retry the same search with Yahoo, the spammed results <font color=blue>decrease from 
more than 30.000 to just two</font> (well, six if you wide to <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=%22M.S.%2C+A.M.H.A%22&sm=Yahoo%21+Search&toggle=1&ei=UTF-8&fr=FP-tab-web-t&dups=1">http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=%22M.S.%2C+A.M.H.A%22&sm=Yahoo%21+Search&toggle=1&ei=UTF-8&fr=FP-tab-web-t&dups=1</a>)
 and these two are probably kept mainly for didactical reasons. This means that 
<font color=blue>it is now much too easy to spam google</font>: yahoo filters are 
<a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=%22M.S.%2C+A.M.H.A%22&sm=Yahoo%21+Search&fr=FP-tab-web-t&toggle=1&cop=&ei=UTF-8">MUCH BETTER</a>.
<br><br>
The advice is hence to use Yahoo more nowadays (despite it being    
a dangerous serial killer of good search engines like Alltheweb/Fast) together with <a href="http://search.ask.com:80/web?q=M.S.%2C+A.M.H.A&qsrc=66">ask</a>  (ex-teoma) 
and <a href="http://search.msn.com:80/results.aspx?q=M.S.%2C+A.M.H.A.&FORM=QBHP">MSN</a>, 
(unfortunately both not as good as <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=%22M.S.%2C+A.M.H.A%22&sm=Yahoo%21+Search&fr=FP-tab-web-t&toggle=1&cop=&ei=UTF-8">yahoo</a>, even if not 
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&hs=18r&hl=en&lr=&client=opera&rls=en&q=M.S++A.M.H.A&btnG=Search">as bad as google</a>) and 
the various <a href="inktomi.html">inktomi</a> engines

<b>Whoa</b>&nbsp;<font size=-2>(07/04/06&nbsp;03:52:22)</font>
<br>
Wow; I must admit that I didn't expect a whole essay to be created out of this ;). 
<br>
<br>so, let me try to answer some stuff asked by ritz:
<br>
<br>&gt;"did you actually take a look at that page, try to find something useful on it? &gt;:)"
<br>
<br>actually yes. true, there's a lot of crap. but some interesting things exist as well, and not only in "deep web 
research." (i found some interesting stuff under "research resources", "reference resources" and, interestingly, on 
"information quality resources" [isn't it ironic that for instance the following: 
http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/TeachingLib/Guides/Internet/Evaluate.html -- comes 
from link on the latter?] as well as on a bunch of other pages). so the page passes 
the second ritz' test (imho).
<br>bottom line is: yeah, there's a lot of spammish self-linking and the dude tries to sell some of his crap. 
i am in no way fond of these, we shall say, activities. but the question i want to ask is-- <font color=blue>should 
we dismiss the whole site in its entirety</font>? or maybe trying to separate the crap from the interesting stuff 
on it could be a better idea?

<br>
I'm not sure that your MS AHMA test really does google justice. While it's true that yahoo apparently recognizes AMHA as a spam term, this doesn't really solve the spam problem.
<br>
<br>What I mean is that MS AHMA is a unique signal that's generated by a unique target (our beloved Mr. Zillman) 
<font color=blue>and when using such a query I would actually expect a search engine to point me to all of his sites</font>.
<br>
<br>The other (worse?) thing is the fact that the presence of AHMA on a page doesn't seem to affect yahoo's rating of that page. So "innocent" queries, like <a target=_top href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=%22intuitive+searching%22+resources&prssweb=Search&ei=UTF-8&fr=FP-tab-web-t&x=wrt">"intuitive searching" resources</a> still lead us to Zillman's sites.

<br>
Yep, you'r right.
<br>Yet the question remains: why should we compelled, with google, to add a 
<br>-MS.AHMA
<br>in order to eliminate spam, when Yahoo (apparently) does it automatically?
<br>
<br>And who (but us seekers) can anyway be interested in checking spam-centrico queries on the web?
<br>
<br>If ever, google should present options <u>the other way round</u> (could be quite interesting btw :)
<br>They could add a 'see spam as well' link after 'cache' (that as we have seen almost does not work no more) and 'similar pages' (or even integrate it in the similar pages)
<br>
<br>
<br>Btw: have a look at this:
<br>http://zillman.blogspot.com/rss/zillman.xml
<br>the guy is just a script kid imho, maybe now even beginning to take himself seriously, similar to that 'johnny I hackstuff' kid we already discussed

<br>
<br>Hm.. the point I was trying to make is that yahoo filters Zillman <b>only if the query contains "M.S., A.M.H.A"</b>. So when searching for other stuff (see <a target=_top href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=%22intuitive+searching%22+resources&prssweb=Search&ei=UTF-8&fr=FP-tab-web-t&x=wrt">"intuitive searching" resources</a>) you'll have to add a -MS.AHMA with yahoo as well.
<br>
<br>Btw, I don't think that the two results we get from yahoo in <a target=_top href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=%22M.S.%2C+A.M.H.A%22&sm=Yahoo%21+Search&fr=FP-tab-web-t&toggle=1&cop=&ei=UTF-8">fravia's query</a> are there for didactic purposes. I have a sneaking suspicion that the results are the only two pages on the web that contain the string "M.S., A.M.H.A" and do not link back to Zillman's self referential structure.
