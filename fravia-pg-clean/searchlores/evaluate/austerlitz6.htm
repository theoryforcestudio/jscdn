AUSTERLITZ<br>
THE BATTLE OF THE THREE EMPERORS<br></font>
<br></center>
The northern
 extremity of the battle area is marked by the 700-foot mound 
 of the Santon, overlooking the main highway from Bruenn to Olmutz, which 
 runs immediately to its south. This road runs over two streams, the Goldbach 
 and its tributary the Bosenitzer, flowing south through steep and narrow 
 gorges to join at the village of Puntowitz. 
 <br>
 This hamlet forms a triangle with Lapanz (or
Schlappanitz) and Jirschikowitz (Girschkowitz), enclosing between 
them an area of rising ground known today as the Breiterfeld, climbing to a
height of 850 Feet at its peak, the Zurlan. Nestling behind this height to the 
westward lies the village of Bellowitz. From Puntowitz the Goldbach wends
its solitary way south toward Kobelnitz, Zokolnitz and Tellnitz through a 
gradually broadening valley containing marshy fields, and, at the time of
the battle, a series of small lakes or meres which have since disappeared.
<br> To the west of
the Goldbach lies a long, low ridge and to the east the ground 
climbs steadilily toward the village of Pratzen and the plateau beyond, which 
levels out at a height of between 900 and 1000 feet above sea level. Two 
re-entrants lead from the stream toward the Heights. To the north and east
of this dominating feature lie the villages of Blasowitz and Krzenowitz respectively 
and to the south, the township of Aujest Markt (Augezd). The town of Austerlitz 
lies three miles away to the east of the Pratzen Heights on the banks of the Littawa River.
<br>
After making a detailed inspection of this ground, the Emperor formulated 
his plan of battle. He decided to allow the enemy the unopposed occupation 
of the Pratzen Heights, making the Goldbach and its nearby villages the dividing boundary. 
<br>In order to lure the enemy's main attack in that direction, the right wing of the 
French line would be kept deliberately weak, although Davout's corps should be at hand 
to reinforce it. The bulk of the French army was to be concealed in the dead ground 
behind the Zurlan; at the right moment, this force would be unleashed against the 
Pratzen Heights to break through the enemy's weakened center and fall on his rear. 
Meantime, the
nortehrn flank would be held by the garrison of the Santon supported by a strong force 
of Murat's cavalry. Pivoting on the Pratzen, the enemy would, it was hoped, 
uncover their own line of retreat.

<br><hr><br>

On November 29, the French forces that were already to hand took up their initial positions.
 The defense of the Santon was entrusted to Lannes' corps, consisting of the divisions of 
 Suchet and the younger Cafarelli. Field fortifications were erected around the mound, 
 and a battery of eight guns installed. To the right of the Vth Corps, Murat's reserve 
 cavalry was bivouaced together with a park of twenty-four light field guns. 
 In the dead ground to the south of the main road, the ten battalions of the Imperial 
 Guard and the grenadiers of General Oudinot were stationed alongside forty more guns, 
 and to their rear and left, a space was reserved for Bernadotte's Ist Corps, still on 
 the road to the battlefield. The French right flank was deliberately extended and 
 held by Soult's IVth Corps, the divisions of Vandamme and St. Hilaire being massed 
 in the vicinity of Puntowitz, and Legrand's command being split up into garrisons 
 for the villages of Kobelnitz, Zokolnitz and Tellnitz. In due course, the weakly 
 held southern extremity of the French line would be successively reinforced from 
 the direction of Vienna by the arrival of Davout's cavalry and the following 
 divisions of Friant and Gudin.<br>
So affairs rested until December I when the enemy at length made their appearance 
from the northeast. The first Russian columns occupied the Goldbach Height to the 
north of the road, but by the afternoon the formations of their center and left wing 
were seen to be deploying onto the Pratzen Heights. By evening, 85400 Allied troops 
had reached the field together with 278 guns, and the Tsar and Austrian Emperor 
established their joint headquarters in the village of Krzenowitz. 
A further force of 5000 Russians was also coming up from Olmutz. On the further 
side of the Goldbach rivulet, Napoleon now disposed of 66800 men and 139 cannon; 
Bernadotte's corps' had duly arrived, but there was still no sign of Davout.
<br>
Throughout the afternoon of December I, a hot discussion continued at the 
village of Krzenowitz. Each faction in the Allied headquarters had its own 
proposals to make, and this made the formulation of a final plan a tedious affair. 
The Emperor Francis, prematurely old, depressed and discredited by 
the disasters already suffered by his armies, continued to advise caution. 
So did the wily veteran Kutusov, but his views were not put forward with the 
greatest vigor. The young and talented Tsar at length favored the advice of 
his aides-de-camp, who included Dolgorouki, Lieven, Volkonski and Stroganov, 
and approved the plan put forward by the Austrian chief of staff Weyrother, 
"a veteran of the Viennese offices," who did not share his master's predilection 
for continued temporization and therefore supported the hot-heads who were advocating 
immediate action.
<br><hr><br>

Although the first moves of major units began in the late afternoon, it was not until 1.00 
A.M. the next morning that the Allied commanders were summoned to receive their detailed 
orders. General Langeron recorded the scene for posterity: "When we had all assembled 
General Weyrother arrived, unfolded upon a large table an immense and most accurate map 
of the environs of Briinn and Austerlitz, and read the dispositions to us in a loud tone 
and with a self-satisfied air which indicated a thorough persuasion of his own merit and 
of our incapacity. He was really like a college teacher reading a lesson to young scholars. Kutusov, seated and half asleep when we arrived, at length fell into a sound nap before our departure." Langeron noticed that of all the generals only Doctorov examined the map attentively.2I
The general intention of Weyrother's plan was to turn the French right flank by making 
a crossing in force over the Goldbach between the villages of Tellnitz and Zokolnitz, 
followed by a swing to the north which would envelop the French as they fled for the 
security of Minn. Kienmayer's cavalry would accompany this attack in its initial stages, 
but once a footing over the Goldbach had been achieved, the Austrian was to strike 
westward to sever the Briinn-Vienna road near the town of Gross Raigern and thus 
preclude the possibility of any further reinforcements reaching the French from 
that quarter. A secondary attack would meanwhile be launched against Napoleon's 
left flank down the axis of the Olmutz-Briinn highway with the intention of tying 
down the French forces stationed there during the crucial moves to the south.
The implementation of this plan involved the subdivision of the Allied army 
of 85,400 men into seven parts. No less than 59,300 troops were allocated 
to mount the main attack against the French right under the overall command 
of Buxhowden. Led by Kienmayer's advance guard, General Doctorov's 13,600 
troops of the first column would open the battle by capturing the village 
of Tellnitz before swinging north to join Langeron for a joint-crossing 
over the Goldbach. By that time Langeron's column (11,700) should already
have stormed Zokolnitz with the assistance of Przbysewski's third column  (1o,ooo) 
on his right. Once over the stream, these three forces would unite north of 
the lake near Kobelnitz, and launch a determined attack against the french center, 
who would, by that time, presumably be holding a new front
tching from Puntowitz to Turas. At this stage of the battle, the fourth 
Allied column, consisting of Kollowrath's Austrians and Miloradovitch's Russians 
and totaling 23,900 men, would make a frontal attack against the
"hinge" of the inverted French battleline at Puntowitz after a direct advance
from the Pratzen Heights. Throughout this main attack, Bagration's 13,000
<br><hr><br>

infantry would be pressing the French left and endeavoring to capture the 
Santon while Lichtenstein's 4,600 cavalry linked right and center. In 
reserve behind the center, the Grand Duke Constantine would command the 
8,500 elite troops of the'Russian Imperial Guard to the north of Krzenowitz. 
These measures, it was confidently anticipated, would encompass Napoleon's 
destruction.<br>
However, a combination of dozing generals and 
early morning overconfidence had already led to one major error in the 
planning which was destined to determine the fortunes of December 2. 
The size of the Allied main attack would inevitably denude the center 
of troops and lay this open to attack by the French; only part of Miloradovitch's 
and Kollowrath's columns would be available to defend the area during the crisis
 of the battle, and this fact might well invite a French counterattack. This objection 
 to Weyrother's plan was actually put forward at the conference by General 
 Langeron but the sleepy consensus of opinion was that the danger was more 
 imaginary than real. The Allied high command considered that Napoleon was 
 already more than half beaten. If this was not the case, why had the French 
 not forced action on the Ist, while the Allies were inconvenienced by their 
 approach march? Why had Napoleon relinquished control of the dominating 
 Pratzen without so much as a skirmish? These arguments convinced Weyrother 
 at least that the risk to the weakened center would be negligible; in any case, 
 the Grand Duke Constantine's reserve would be available to deal with any French 
 attack toward the Pratzen. This amounted to a fatal miscalculation, proving the 
 complete efficacy of Napoleon's deliberate deception plan. The bait was swallowed, 
 and the hook firmly embedded; bar mischances, the outcome of Austerlitz 
 was practically decided.<br>
Throughout December I, the French Emperor was kept minutely informed of the enemy's moves. Most of the day was spent inspecting units and ensuring that their weapons were in good order, but in the late afternoon a large enemy movement toward the village of Augezd was reported as Kienmayer; Langeron and Doctorov moved into their appointed places facing the French right. From that moment a jubilant Napoleon was sure that the enemy was', conforming to the required plan. "Before tomorrow evening this army will be
mine," he stated with conviction. One anxiety remained to nag at his 
mind and that was the continued absence of Davout, but he was certain that 
his subordinate would arrive in time to play his part on the right. 
This faith was 
justified, for in the late evening he received news that Davout's leading formation, 	
Friant's division (6,000 strong) had made contact with Legrand's
patrols and would bivouac for the night at Gross Raigern within a few
miles of the Goldbach.
<br><hr><br>

Serving with this formation was, of course, our informant Corporal Blaise, 
and he has left an interesting account of his division's 8o-mile forced march from 
Vienna carried out in the space of fifty hours, which illustrates the type 
of performance the French infantry could achieve:<br><br>
"<font color=blue>We left the village where we were lodging at nine in the 
evening. We marched until two in the morning when we halted in a wood. There 
we lit some fires and slept until five when we returned to the road. All day 
we marched and again camped in the woods; at six o'clock that evening we had 
not even had time to prepare our eagerly-awaited soup when we were informed 
that we should be leaving again at nine. We consequently preferred to fill 
the time until then with sleep; we had been issued with three days' bread 
ration at Vienna before setting out so we didn't go short, but it was all 
we had to eat. Then, leaving our position, we marched on until five A.M. 
when the regiment halted . . . . The colonel, whose interest in our welfare 
had never flagged from the opening of the campaign, now gave us an abundance 
of wine. This rallied our strength and put us in a fit state for continuing 
the march. When the officers considered that the greater part of the men 
had rejoined their companies we set off again, the colonel leaving behind 
an officer to rally the stragglers. At length we reached a village at 
seven in the evening where we camped alongside a division of dragoons . . . . 
I leave it to you to guess whether or not we employed the night for sleep 
after so long a march!</font>"<br><br>
Back on the main battlefield, at 8:3o P.M. the Emperor issued his preliminary 
orders for the following day. Sixty-five thousand troops were to mass behind 
the Santon and in the angle formed by the two streams. On the extreme right, 
Legrand's division of Soult's corps was at all costs to hold back the main 
anticipated Austrian attack until the IIIrd Corps could come up to its aid. 
On the opposite flank, Lannes was charged with the defense of the Santon  and 
its environs, with Murat's cavalry reserve on his right hand. Bernadotte I'st 
Corps was to move up from behind the Santon and re-form between the villages of 
Girschkowitz and Puntowitz, ready to launch an attack against Blasowitz. 
Between them, these three major formations should be sufficient to keep the Allied right 
in play. The main French attack would then be made by two divisions of Soult's corps; 
by 7:3o in the morning, Vandamme's and St. Hilaire's troops were to be formed 
up on the further bank of the Goldbach as if for a move to the flank, but at the given 
signal their task was to storm the Pratzen Heights and break the Allied center. 
The Imperial Guard and Oudinot's grenadiers were to be held in reserve, available 
to strengthen the
southern flank in case of emergency or, more importantly, to exploit the
capture of the Pratzen by a movement designed to envelop the enemy.

<br><hr><br>

To put the men on their mettle, an Order of the Day was issued, part of which ran 
as follows:
<br><br><font color=blue>
The positions which we occupy are formidable, and while the Russians march upon our 
batteries I shall attack their flanks.
Soldiers, I shall in person direct all your battalions; I shall keep out of range 
if, with your accustomed bravery, you carry disorder and confusion into the ranks 
of the enemy; but if the victory is for a moment uncertain, you shall see your 
Emperor expose himself in the front rank ....
Note that no man shall leave the ranks under the pretext 
of carrying off the wounded. Let every man be filled with the thought 
that it is vitally necessary to conquer these paid lackeys of England who 
so strongly hate our nation. . .</font><br><br>
This flamboyant order undoubtedly put a keen edge on the men's courage; they felt 
at one with their commander in chief, and the fact that he took them into his
 confidence raised morale to a new height.<br>
His orders issued, the Emperor dined with his officers, partaking of his favorite 
campaign dish of potatoes fried with onions. He was in his best form, talking 
cheerfully of Egypt and the lure of the East, gossiping about the reported appearance
 of a comet over Paris, surely an omen of victory for the morrow. Following a brief 
 rest, he left the ruined but that constituted his quarters and set out on a further 
 tour of inspection, frequently pausing to stare into the night in an attempt to 
 discern the lie of the enemy's campfires; a reassuring quantity could be spotted 
 around Augezd to the south. A welcome arrival was the weary Marshal Davout, come 
 to report that his cavalry and advance guard would be in position by eight the 
 next morning, closely followed by the rest of his infantry. A relieved Emperor 
 then returned to his bivouac escorted by cheering soldiers in the famous torchlight 
 procession.<br>
The night passed reasonably quietly; there was one skirmish when a patrol of 
Austrian hussars reached the outskirts of Zokolnitz, but they were rapidly repulsed. 
In the early hours of the morning Savary, the chief of the operational staff, returned 
from a forward reconnaissance with tidings that the enemy in the vicinity of Augezd 
were at least a corps in strength. The Emperor was roused to hear these tidings, and 
Marshal Soult was summoned to an , impromptu conference. After a keen study of the
 maps, at 3:oo A.M. the Emperor dictated some slight changes to his original 
 orders, involving a change of emphasis rather than a radical alteration. 
 On account, we may
 
 <br><hr><br>
 surmise, of the enemy's strength to the south, the attack on the Pratzen 
 was shifted slightly to the north to make the most of the anticipated weakening 
 of the Allied right center. Vandamme and St. Hilaire would now attack from 
 Puntowitz. Further orders also allocated an additional 4,000 men to strengthen 
 the right during the critical period preceding the arrival ofDavout's corps in 
 force. The Emperor then returned to his pile of straw while his staff 
 busied themselves issuing the new order.<br>
The first troops were roused at 4:00 A.m., and as they moved to their 
allotted positions it was soon noticed that a thick morning mist had 
developed. This phenomenon caused considerable confusion on the further 
bank of the Goldbach, where the Allied columns were forming up for their 
initial attack, and the confusion proved greatly to the French advantage 
in the first hour of the battle. Nevertheless, at 7:00 A.M., a heavy attack 
developed around y Tellnitz, when Kienmayer's advance guard clashed with 
Legrand's garrison. At first all went well for the French, but a little later 
the bulk of Doctorov's strong column loomed out of the fog and by 8:00 A.M. 
the 1,2oo survivors of the 3rd Regiment of the Line were forced to relinquish 
their hold on the village, their retreat being covered by Davout's <i>chasseurs</i> 
and hussars. Further north, meanwhile, Langeron and Przbysewski were in the act 
of storming Zokolnitz. General Mangeron's handful of <i>Tirailleurs du Po</i> 
repulsed the first attack and were then reinforced by General Merle's 26th Light 
Brigade, bringing the garrison to a strength of I,8oo and six guns. But by 8:30 
A.M. no less than 3o enemy cannon had been brought to bear, and a renewed attack by 
8,000 Allies proved too much for the defense, and so Zokolnitz, in its turn, 
fell into enemy hands. However, away behind Tellnitz, Marshal Davout was 
organizing a counterattack with Heudelet's brigade, which included the footsore 
Corporal Blaise:
<br><br><font color=blue>
Before ordering the attack, Marshal Davout -who did not leave even though  
the bullets were beginning to bother us- recalled to our minds the action at Marianzelle. 
Then General Heudelet put himself at our head and we marched boldly forward in battle 
order until we were halted by a ditch which was too large for us to cross. 
General Heudelet thereupon ordered our colonel to move us over a bridge 
away to our left. This necessary movement was the cause of our undoing, for 
the soldiers were so eager to come to grips with the vaunted
 enemy infantry that they disordered the ranks in spite of <i>les sages avis</i> 
 of our 
officers; and when we tried to re-form our battle order under heavy fire, 
some Austrian hussars, mistaking us for Bavarians in the thick smoke and 
fog which
was a feature of the day, wounded a great many of us and captured 
6o men, including 4 officers.</font><br><br><hr><br>
  By 8:45 A.M., the village was once again in French hands, but the reoccupation was 
 only short-lived. In the confusion of the battle the 108th Regiment had the misfortune 
 to fire upon the 26th Light as it retreated from Zokolnitz, and this event did 
 little to rally the defense. Thus by 9:00 o'clock the enemy was in almost full control 
 of both villages.<br>
Although it might appear that the Allies had secured the first honors of
the day in overall terms, the battle was in fact going well for the French.
	About 8:00 o'clock the rising mists revealed the contours of the Pratzen
	together with the Russian columns moving south "like a torrent"; as
	Napoleon had hoped, the Allied center was becoming steadily weaker
	already 40,000 Allies were massed against the French right, and more were
	on their way. Much now depended on timing the French counterattack for the
correct moment. The divisions of St. Hilaire and Vandamme were on the appointed start 
line over the Goldbach, and their presence was still conveniently disguised from 
the enemy by the lingering fog in the valley. 
To ensure the necessary <i>elan</i>, the men were fortified with an issue of a triple 
spirit
ration.
"How long will it take you to move your divisions to the top of the Pratzen Heights?" 
the Emperor enquired of Soult. "Less than twenty minutes, Sire,
for my troops are hidden at the foot of the valley, hidden by fog and campfire smoke," 
was the reply. "In that case, we will wait a further quarter of an hour. 
Through his spyglass Napoleon was watching the steady movements of two more enemy 
columns (Kollowrath and Miloradovitch) toward the south. When he judged that they 
had moved sufficiently far on their jourey, the Emperor gave the word. Hoarse orders 
were shouted, the drums beat the <i>pas de charge</i> and the two divisions 
Were on their way, the sunlight glinting along the lines of bayonets as the troops 
emerged from the protective mists; it was 9:00 o'clock. On the right, General St. 
Hilaire made rapidly for his objective, the village of Pratzen itself; little 
opposition was encountered, very soon the French had pushed beyond the village 
onto the very
summit of the plateau. On the left, advancing toward the peak of Stahre
Vinobrady, General Vandamme was not quite so fortunate, running into a determined 
enemy force at the village of Girzikowitz which held him up for some little time.
<br>
The Allies were at first astounded by this sudden threat to their center.
Marshal Kutusov and his headquarters, accompanying Miloradovitch's south-bound column, 
suddenly realized the danger as they reached the crest of the
Pratzen en route for Zokolnitz. Halting the troops in his vicinity, Kutusov
hurriedly reversed the direction of their march, but only two battalions
<br><hr><br>


reached the village of Pratzen before the storm broke. This intervention came too 
late to stem the tide of the French advance, and by 9:3o A.M. the Allies were 
reeling back, and the French were well on the way toward becoming masters of 
the Pratzen Heights.
Away to the north, the French left was also in the, process of going into action. 
Hitherto they had hardly exchanged a shot with Bagration's forces, but now Napoleon 
ordered Bernadotte to move on Blasowitz in support of Soult's attack. At first, this 
advance went well, but at 9: 3o A.M. two battalions of the Russian Imperial Guard 
succeeded in recapturing the village. Half an hour later, the entire French left was 
locked in furious combat with the foe. Murat's cavalry and a column under Lannes
 moved forward to pin down Bagration's infantry and Lichtenstein's squadrons of
 cavalry. A swarm of horsemen descended upon Cafarelli's division, but it was beaten 
 off with heavy casualties by Kellermann's Light Cavalry. Blithely accepting odds 
 of ten to one, the French troopers dismounted and poured a withering carbine fire 
 into the enemy ranks. This was followed by a charge, and Lichtenstein's attack 
 lost its impetus. Nevertheless, Lannes was still in trouble, for Bagration's 30 
 cannon continued to take a terrible toll, 40o men of Cafarelli's command being 
 laid low in the space of three minutes, but a brief lull eventually descended 
 on this sector of the field following the charge of the Allied cavalry. However, 
 it was not very long-lived; Bagration was soon launching a new assault against 
 the Santon, but the 17th Regiment of the Line held firm. A little later Lannes 
 restormed Blasowitz at bayonet point, taking Soo prisoners and five guns. Then 
 it was Murat's turn; the opportunity of driving a wedge between Bagration and 
 Kutusov was too good to miss. Three thousand French horsemen started forward, 
 but they were soon opposed by twice their number as Bagration, aware of the French
  design, flung every available squadron into the fray. Forty squadrons attacked the 
  flank of Cafarelli's division as it pressed forward from Blasowitz, but the
  stalwart infantry changed front and beat off three enemy charges until such 
  time as Murat could move up Hautpol's and Nansouty's cuirassiers from reserve.
  These imposing warriors, horsehair plumes tossing and cuirasses gleaming, pounded 
  forward at a full trot on a 400-yard front, sustaining heavy casualties from the 
  enemy fire, to plunge into the left flank of the Allied cavalry. The sound of the 
  impact was heard throughout the field over the din of battle. For five minutes the
   struggle swayed to and fro, but then the Allied horse broke under the pressure. 
   Lichtenstein succeeded in rallying part of his flagging cavalry and counterattacked 
   the French who had scattered in pursuit, but this move was thrown into hopeless 
   disarray by the arrival on

		the scene of the second regiment of French cuirassiers. On the extreme left,
		meanwhile, Lannes' infantry had been plodding doggedly forward against
	Bagration's	divisions. The rate of advance was slow, for the Vth Corps
			contained a high proportion of relatively inexperienced conscripts who had to
	be	kept closely in hand. Nevertheless, these units acquitted themselves
		nobly. In his report General Suchet wrote: "<font color=blue>During the 
		battle the infantry
			underwent artillery fire with the greatest coolness. 
			The Emperor's orders
			were faithfully executed, and, perhaps for the first time since the beginning
		of the war,	the greater part of the wounded dragged themselves to the
			ambulances.</font>" As a result of these combined efforts on the left, Bagration was
			virtually sundered from the remainder of the Allied army by noon, and Lannes
		had carried out his instructions to isolate the enemy right.
			The initial capture of the Pratzen plateau proved only the beginning of the
			battle in the center, and many crises had to be overcome before the French
		possession	of the area was secure. Shortly after 10:00 A.M. St. Hilaire's
			division underwent a heavy ordeal when it was suddenly attacked on the
			right flank by the rear brigade of Langeron's returning column at a moment
			when the French were already hotly engaged with Kollowrath's troops to the
	fore and Kamenskoi's reserves on the left. Attacked simultaneously from three
			sides, the weary French troops began to waver, but St. Hilaire's determination
			and courage rallied the men to meet the crisis. Instead of awaiting the full
			impact of the combined enemy assault, he led his men forward in a desperate
		bayonet charge, and thereby earned a short respite. This gave Soult time to
		rush up the six 12-pounder guns of his corps artillery reserve; the marshal
		came forward in person to supervise their fire. A furious struggle ensued;
			cannon roared and musketry crackled-but great gaps were torn in Langeron's
			lines, and by 11:00 o'clock the worst crisis was past. On St. Hilaire's left,
		General Vandamme was, by this time, hotly engaged with 2,500 troops of
			Kollowrath's command and a further nine battalions under Miloradovitch,
		but by midday the enemy was pulling back on this sector as well. Except
		for their eastern edge, therefore, the Pratzen Heights were securely in Soult's
	possession.<br>
		Away on the French right flank, a bitter struggle of varying fortune had
	been proceeding all morning. After the fall of Tellnitz and Zokolnitz, the
	Emperor	became somewhat anxious about the sector, and shortly after
	9:30 A.m. he detached General Oudinot's grenadiers from the reserve with
	orders to strengthen the southern flank. In the event, however, the situation
in this area rapidly improved once Soult's attack on	the Pratzen became
		operative. A lull descended as the Allied columns on the left awaited orders

<br><hr><br>




in the light of the new situation, and when Kutusov attempted to withdraw part 
of the second and third columns to strengthen his center, the cavalry of the 
IVth Corps played an important role by launching several charges against the 
countermarching Allies, with the result that the move was considerably hampered 
and delayed. During this period, the three routed French regiments were afforded 
time to form a new line to the west of the villages they had lost, and by 10:00 o'clock 
they were reinforced by the arrival of General Friant's weary division (part of 
Davout's corps) from Gross Raigern. These valuable additions to the fighting line 
enabled the struggle for Zokolnitz to be renewed; Brigadier Lochet stormed the 
village with two regiments, capturing two standards and six Russian guns. Leaving 
the 48th Regiment to garrison the regained objective, Lochet led forward the 
IIIth Regiment in a bold attempt to storm the castle of Zokolnitz on the eastern 
bank of the Goldbach. Before he reached his target, however, Langeron launched a 
vicious counterattack against Zokolnitz, virtually wiping out the 48th, and 
Friant had no alternative but to recall the IIIth to meet the new threat. 
For the rest of the morning, 8,000 French infantry and 2,800 cavalry 
fought off 35,000 Allies in an agonizing battle of attrition; although 
the greater part of Zokolnitz passed back yet again into Russian hands, 
the tenacious Lochet never relinquished his hold on the southern edge 
of the town, and the French line held.<br>
By midday, therefore, the battle was going decidedly 
in Napoleon's favor. On the left, Lannes and Murat, with 
some assistance from Bernadotte, had successfully contained and 
isolated Bagration on the Allied right; in the center, Soult was 
in control of the Pratzen in the very midst of the enemy array; 
on the right, Davout had largely stemmed the tide of the Allied 
advance, supported in the rear by Oudinot's grenadiers linking 
the sector with the center. A French victory was practically assured, 
but the extent of the triumph was still in doubt.<br>
The time was approaching for the final breaking of the Allied 
line, and the envelopment and destruction of at least the exposed 
left 
flank. As a preliminary move, Napoleon extricated Bernadotte's 
corps from the battle against Bagration, and moved the imperial 
Guard onto the left bank of the Goldbach to form a powerful mane 
de de'ciriorv. Imperial Headquarters was also moved. onto the Pratzen. 
Deciding that the decisive effort should have as its aim the envelopment 
of Buxhowden's command, Napoleon ordered the entire French center to 
incline to its right. By this time, only one serious obstacle stood 
between the French and success-the serried ranks of the redoubtable 
Russian Imperial Guard, horse and foot, which now moved magnificently


<br><hr><br>
forward from its reserve position to fill the void developing in the Allied center.
Shortly after 1:00 o'clock, the Grand Duke Ferdinand led up four fresh battalions 
of this elite corps to attack the weary and powder-stained troops of General 
Vandamme. Unfortunately for the success of this assault, the 3,000 Russians 
were too eager to come to grips with the French after a morning of 
infuriating inaction, and consequently charged full tilt with the bayonet 
from a distance of 300 yards. By the time they reached their objective, 
therefore, most of the men were seriously out of breath; nevertheless, the 
Russian Guard broke through the forward French line with little difficulty
 and were brought to a halt only by the concentrated fire of the second 
 formations. Its impetus temporarily exhausted, the Russian Guard fell 
 back in good order on Krzenowitz to reform.<br>
At this moment, Vandamme received Napoleon's order to incline to his right, 
but in executing this movement he inevitably exposed his left flank and rear. 
Such an opportunity was not overlooked by the Grand Duke Constantine; 15 squadrons 
of the Guard cavalry at once fell on Vandamme's flank, supported by a 
renewed frontal assault by the Russian grenadiers.<br>
Under very heavy pressure General Vandamme kept his head in admirable 
fashion, and immediately moved two battalions of the 4th Line 
and the 24th Light to cover his exposed flank. The Russian attack 
was so impetuous, records de Segur, "that Vandamme's two battalions 
on the left were overwhelmed! One of them, indeed, after losing its 
eagle and the greater part of its weapons, only got up to flee at full 
speed. This battalion, belonging to the 4th Regiment, almost passed 
over ourselves and Napoleon himself-our attempts to arrest it being 
all in vain. The unfortunate fellows were quite distracted with fear 
and would listen to no one; in reply to our reproaches for thus 
deserting the field of battle and their Emperor they shouted 
mechanically, "<i>Vive l'Empereur!</i>" while fleeing faster than ever.<br>
It was fortunate for the French that no Allied reserves were at hand to 
exploit this success. Napoleon's first reaction was to send forward 
Bessieres with the cavalry of the imperial Guard. The first two 
squadrons were repulsed by the Russian guardsmen, but the second wave 
of the counterattack, three squadrons of horse grenadiers supported 
by batteries of horse artillery, fared considerably better. 
This struggle was now joined by the division of General Drouet, 
detached by Marshal Bernadotte on his own initiative when he saw 
how critical affairs were in the center. The advent of this 
reinforcement stabilized the situation, and Napoleon thereupon 
sent forward his senior aide-de-camp, General Rapp, with two 
squadrons of chasseurs of the Guard
<br><hr><br>
and one of Mamelukes to give the coup de grace. The tired Russians were
		unable to withstand the impact of this new attack, and within ten minutes
		5oo grenadiers were dead and 200 members of the nobly-born Chevalier
		Guard-the Tsar's personal escort-together with their commander, Prince
		Repnine, were taken prisoner. These captives were led back in triumph to
	the Emperor who remarked that: "Many fine ladies of St. Petersburg will
	lament this day." Meanwhile the survivors of the Russian Imperial Guard
	reeled back toward Krzenowitz, hotly pursued by Bernadotte's command.
		With this repulse, the Allied center ceased to exist; it was shortly after 2 :00
		o'clock in the afternoon and the moment of exploitation had come, although
		events had not followed exactly the course Napoleon originally anticipated.
			Napoleon rapidly issued new orders. The occupation of the Pratzen Heights
		was entrusted to Bernadotte; the Guard, Oudinot's grenadiers and Soult's
	battle-weary divisions were to swing south to envelop Buxhowden from
		the north and east, while Davout attacked from the west. By 2:30 P.M.,
		Buxhowden found himself in a decidedly critical situation. His wing of the
		army was now isolated from its fellows, and no orders were forthcoming from
		either Kutusov or the Tsar; Vandamme was soon in occupation of Augezd,
		and Davout's divisions were passing from the defensive to the attack and
		driving remorselessly forward once more toward the villages of Zokolnitz
	and Tellnitz. Too late, the Russian marshal ordered half his force to retreat
		to the east before the French blocked the route, and the remainder to fight
	their way north up the west bank of the Goldbach. Vandamme caught the
	eastbound columns and pinned them down; the forces pressing north were
		soon halted by the combined action of St. Hilaire and Marshal Davout. After
		a long day of attrition and heavy casualties-Corporal Blaise's unit alone
	lost four captains, two lieutenants and 7o men killed, a further dozen officers
		wounded, while the colonel had three horses killed under him -the mood
		of the French troops was predictably grim. General Thiebault of St. Hilaire's
	division records: "Up to the last hour of the battle, we took no prisoners, it
	would not do to run any risk; one could stick at nothing, and thus not a
	single living enemy remained to our rear." Davout's order to his men was
	simply, "Let not one escape."
			By 3 :00 o'clock the Russians were being driven back into the frozen lakes
		and marshes to the south. Przbysewski's division laid down its arms, and half
		Langeron's division also passed into captivity. Buxhowden's column, retreating
		east, was cut in two by Vandamme from Augezd, and only the marshal with the
	head of his column succeeded in escaping toward Austerlitz. General Doctorov,
completely isolated with his back to the lakes, ordered <i>sauve qui peut</i> and his

<br><hr><br>
5,000 men scattered to seek their individual safety. Many tried to escape over the 
frozen lakes, but Napoleon ordered up 25 cannon to bombard the ice, and the effect 
of the cannonballs added to the weight of the heedlessly galloping enemy gun teams 
caused the surface to crack and break, depositing several thousand unfortunates into 
the freezing waters. The French bulletins later claimed that as many as 20,000 
perished in this way, but this figure is undoubtedly a gross exaggeration; only 5,000
 Allied troops were in the vicinity of the lakes at this time, and it is probable 
 that 2,000 were drowned (some authorities put the figure as low as 200.
  However, it is certain that 38 guns and 130 corpses of horses were recovered 
  from the waters of Lake Satschen after the battle.
As defeat developed inexorably into disaster on the Allied center and left, 
Marshal Bagration decided that the time had come to extricate his relatively 
intact wing of the army. The battle to the north had been fierce during the 
early afternoon, and at one point the Russians had almost overwhelmed Suchet's
 recruits on the extreme left before Lannes was able to retrieve the situation
  by attacking Bagration's center and left with the remainder of his corps, but by 3:00
   o'clock, Bagration's retreat was under way, and by 4:30 P.m., all firing 
   had died away on the northern flank. The French were too weary to harry 
   Bagration sufficiently, and within the next 4o hours he succeeded in putting 
   6o kilometers of ground between himself and the battlefield.<br>

At five in the evening, a general cease fire was sounded over the entire 
battlefield. The gruesome task of assessing casualties now began. It appears 
probable that Il,ooo Russians and 4,000 Austrians lay dead on the field, and 
that a further 12,ooo Allied troops were made prisoner, together with 180 guns and 50
 colors and standards. Thus the Austro-Russian army lost some 27,000 casualties-or 
 one third of its original effective strength. The French however, 
 escaped relatively lightly: perhaps 1,305 were killed, a further 6,940 
 wounded, and 573 more captured.
Napoleon had gained his decisive victory, and it duly brought his campaign 
to a triumphant conclusion. The Third Coalition was now on the verge 
of collapse. The day after the battle the Austrian Emperor was to 
seek an armistice while the Tsar and his Russians retreated toward 
Hungary and Poland. News of the great victory in Moravia was to hasten
the death of a heartbroken William Pitt, France's most inveterate foe. 
But all this lay in the . future as a jubilant but exhausted Napoleon 
wrote a brief note to his wife, the Empress Josephine: "<font color=blue>I have beaten 
the Austro-Russian army commanded by the two Emperors. I am a little 
weary. I have camped in the open for eight days and as many freezing nights. Tomorrow I shall be able to rest
 in the castle of Prince Kaunitz, and I should be able to snatch two or three hours sleep there. 
 The Russian army is not only beaten but destroyed. I embrace you. Napoleon.</font>"
