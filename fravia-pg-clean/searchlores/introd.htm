I have opened my <a href="http://www.searchlores.org">www.searchlores.org</a>, 
in Oz, in February 2000. 
Searchlores seems fairly popular: I  receive
on my main site alone an average of (around) a million hits per month, 
without counting the (many) hits on mirrors like <a href="http://www.searchlore.org">www.searchlore.org</a> in the States  
 (note 
the missing "<font color=blue>s</font>" after lore), or 
<a href="http://www.fravia.net">www.fravia.net</a> in Europe, or the <a href="mirrors.htm">other</a> existing ones.
<br><br>  As 
per 2004 some sections of searchlores - as you will notice - are still missing, <i>in fieri</i> or incomplete.<br>This section as well: 
chaotic and incomplete, its purpose should be to give an idea of the variety and richness of our searching techniques. Maybe 
all these introductions are useless, and you would be better served reading some small specific essays, like  the seven 
searching snippets 
"<a href="london/lea2tra.htm" target="_blank">Learning to transform questions into 
          effective queries</a>" that I wrote in 2003.
<br><br>Please note that you will not find any advertisements whatsoever 
on my sites: no banners to click on, no sponsors to promote, nothing. 
I don't need your money: I need your own knowledge, I need your feedback. My only hope is that you will, one beautiful day, 
contribute yourself to the vast wealth of knowledge. 
<br><br>This site
 is continuously 
updated, see <a href="news.htm">the "news" section</a>  
for <i>ad hoc</i> listings.  
 <br><br>
 Some part of this site are getting obsolete, though: you will have to learn how to <a href="evaluate.htm">evaluate</a> 
       the material you find on the web. One relatively 'ancient' section is this very 
        introduction. In 2000 for instance, when searchlores began, <a href="google.htm">google</a> was still in its infancy and the search 
       engine of choice was still <a href="main.htm">altavista</a>.<br> This does not mean that 
       you should now only use            <a href="google.htm">google</a>, <a href="teoma.htm">teoma</a> or
        <a href="fast.htm">fast</a> (considered nowadays the best search engines): Smaller 
        search engines, like <a href="main.htm#Hotbot">hotbot</a>   can reserve interesting surprises, and offer
        the possibility to search <a href="hotbot.htm">through  powerful advanced filters</a>, which let you
pinpoint precisely what you want: domain search,
region search, language search, words to include and words to
exclude and so on.<br></font>

The web is uncharted and deep. At the time of writing this snippet of mine 
there are supposed to 
exist well over 1.500 <u>million</u> indexable pages, expanding  exponentially.
                                                          
 This 
is an underestimation: nobody really knows how many there are. The  "richest" 
search engine covers at the moment  
  only approximately less than a third of 
the existing total (In January 2000 Fast (alltheweb), with 300 millions pages, 
overtook Altavista and its  250 millions pages). The most "rich" search engine at 
the moment covers far less than a third of the existing total: May 2000: 
With 500 million pages the <a href="inktomi/searchtips.html">Inktomi</a> powered 
engines did overtook Altavista (leaving it at 
350 million pages) and Fast. Note that search engines will boast that they 
'selected' a smaller amount of pages, and in reality have visited many 
more (a dual number approach now in vogue to cover search engines 
shortcomings :-) Fact is that their coverage is - even in the best 
and most optimistic hypothesis - meagre.<br>
    As you will see, there are different ways to search the web for nuggets among 
piles of commercial rubbish,  "simple" 
methods but also other, less simple, paths. There are various possible 'strategic' approaches:
<ol><li>You search yourself - <SPAN STYLE="color: black; background: yellow">searching</span>
<ul>
<li>using the main search engines</li>
<li>using newsgroups</li>
<li>using messageboards</li>
<li>using maillists</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You search people that have already searched - luring, trolling, <SPAN STYLE="color: black; background: yellow">combing</span></li>
<li>You follow seekers to where they come from - luring, trolling, <SPAN STYLE="color: black; background: yellow">klebing</span>  </li>
<li>You discover, enter and use "hidden" information databases - seeking, hacking</li>
<li>You write and use YOUR OWN searchbots and let them search for you - 
programming, algo-reversing</li>  
</ol>
Note also that the <SPAN STYLE="color: black; background: yellow">PREPARATION</span> 
phase (topic), the <SPAN STYLE="color: black; background: yellow">EVALUATION</span> 
phase  and the 
<SPAN STYLE="color: black; background: yellow">CONSOLIDATION</span> 
(grepping) phase of each query are quite important "lores" <i>per se</i>.
<hR>
  <IMG align=left valign=top width=9 height=40 SRC="images/dot_green.gif">
You are embarking here on a very long voyage, at the end 
you'll be what I would like to call, lacking a better definition, a good seeker.
As a consequence you will 
probably be able to find <u>anything</u> you may ever being looking for on the web.  

<br>
<bR>
Be warned! This knowledge will <i>inter alia</i> make you quite a dangerous person. 
You'll 
realize this perusing my site, if you didn't know it already. 
This possibility is at the same time 
the very reason for the existence of this site of mine: 
Indeed I'll try to teach and explain you some of the main 
necessary techniques and tricks used by able (and even some "master") seekers 
all over the web, but 
<u>at the same time</u> I'll do my best to (try to) keep you safely on that what I 
believe should be a "knowledge path".<br>
My hope is that  once in possession of this knowledge, you will remain on our side,
helping us spread knowledge for free in a quickly disappearing web of knowledge, 
which has unfortunately been almost stomped to death by a web infested 
by those commercial barbarians that you will now find everywhere, zombies and 
lackeys of the slave-masters who  
use their sharp (and dangerous) horns of <SPAN STYLE="color: black; background: yellow">pushed 
advertisement</span> and <SPAN STYLE="color: black; background: yellow">money</span> 
in order to loot, rape and ultimately destroy all minds seeking knowledge.<br><br>
For these reasons some sections of my site are dedicated to matters that 
I consider quite relevant for any good searcher:<ul>
<lI><font color=blue>[</font><a href="tuttiope.htm">Best browser</a><font color=blue>]</font> (your tool <u>and</u> "weapon") for effective searching purposes (certainly not Microsoft Explorer)</li>
<li>How to eliminate those awful <font color=blue>[</font><a href="remobann.htm">popup banners</a><font color=blue>]</font>  and, more generally, how to nuke, 
fight and <font color=blue>[</font><a href="antiadve.htm">annoy advertisers</a><font color=blue>]</font> (lore, tools, links, techniques)</li>
<li>Some simple <font color=blue>[</font><a href="noanon.htm">anonymity</a><font color=blue>]</font> lore</lI>
<li><font color=blue>[</font><a href="realicra/realicra.htm">Reality cracking</a><font color=blue>]</font> (and -once more- applied anti-advertisement lore)</li>
<lI>Text exegesis (and some applied anti-rhetorical <font color=blue>[</font><a href="realicra/exegesis.htm">semantic</a><font color=blue>]</font> techniques)</li>
<li>How to gather (some snippets of) <font color=blue>[</font><a href="papers.htm">real information</a><font color=blue>]</font></li>
<li>Some simple <font color=blue>[</font><a href="ideale.htm">site busting</a><font color=blue>]</font> lore, which will come handy when you are 
really annoyed 
by commercial spammers and/or porno advertisers and dealers.</lI></uL>
Anyway you are a host: you are <u>not</u> compelled to read or do anything I wish.
 It is up to you and you'll decide. I offer some 
knowledge for free, choose, pick, refuse whatever you 
will.<br>My hope is that 
some of you 
will help and contribute with their own work. I'm aware of the 
fact that there is no guarantee, though, 
never.<bR><bR>

I see it coming... in a few years (actually already now, even if most zombies 
establishments have 
not yet realized it) one of the most important jobs will be, of course, websearcher. 
<br>

We'll have many specialized branches: web-searchers, web-stalkers, web-seekers and so on. Zen and 'feeling' as
well as a very broad 'global' knowledge will be required. 
<bR>
It's a good antidote to the hyperspecialisation that has nearly brought the whole 
silly commercial oriented society we are compelled to live in into a well deserved 
dead end: only large-minded, capable searchers will be able to keep the 'larger' 
over-perspective, and will be able to 
find ANYTHING they need (for free, of course), from Vivaldi's Concerto n.7 in F for four 
violins and cello 
(it's on the Web) through the second edition of the <i>Police Criminelle, Technique 
et Tactique</i> (it's on the Web) to <i>A Western Australian survival kit for writing English</i> (it's 
on the Web).<bR> For the first time in the history of humanity, as long as you have 
web access it DOES NOT MATTER ANYMORE (for knowledge purposes) 
if you are located in a big rich city with huge 
libraries, good universities and a smart cultural life or if you happen 
to live in the middle of nowhere in a very poor country! <SPAN STYLE="color: black; background: yellow">The dream of the lighthouse guardian 
is now reality!</span><br>
EVERYTHING is on the Web for free! I mean: <u>any</u> book, <u>any</u> newspaper, <u>any</u> university 
paper and <u>any</u> image, moreover (soon) 
<u>any</u> sound, <u>any</u> 
music, <u>any</u> film!<br>This means that - amidst 
mountains of useless garbage - <u>ALL ACCUMULATED KNOWLEDGE</u> is on the Web, 
 free for you to discover and enjoy! If you still don't believe it, 
just learn how 
to search, you are in for some surprises!<br><br>So, what is <SPAN STYLE="color: black; background: yellow">a good searcher</span>?
<ul>
<li>A 
<b>good searcher</b> is the kind of guy that can gather 
in a couple of hours all
the material you need to write that nasty University Paper it would have took you 
at least three 
months to put together! (You still have to write that thing, though :-)<br>
<li>A <b>good searcher</b> is the kind of guy that -given half a dozen computers and stable 
internet access- can solve any librarian problem for any  (and wherever located!) 
middle sized town! (it remains to be seen if middle sized towns are really interested 
 in solving 'any librarian problem', though :-)<br>
<li>A <b>good searcher</b> is the kind of guy YOU will need very oft and 
very badly during the next years - that is, 
unless you learn the sublime art of searching yourself! (and that's the purpose 
of 
my site: a small contribution to form the next generation of wizard searchers :-)
<br></ul>
<bR>I sincerely hope  you will be able to gain here some 
very handy knowledge, that I believe  
 you will not easily 
find elsewhere. Anyway, I'm sure that the development of the Web (or at 
least of the  still existing 
'sound'  part of it,  neither commercialised nor brainwashed :-) will more 
and more underline the importance of these activities.<bR>
This whole endeavour is a 'living' workshop, of course, which 
will flourish gathering 
more and more additions from my readers (I sincerely hope that some 
"real" wizard searcher will join my efforts :-)<br>Hope to hear from you, 
and receive contributions from many searchers. Remember: we'll gain a lot  
only if we will be able to build on the shoulders of others, letting them 
build on our ones... if you 
just leech, you lose and we all lose at the same time!<br>

size=+1>


<IMG align=left valign=top width=9 height=70 
SRC="images/dot_green.gif">As you probably already know the various advanced techniques you may 
use in order to search the web amount to a difficult and 
ill-understood art.<br><br>
If you visit the various ad hoc pages for the <a href="google.htm">main.htm</a> search engines, you will
be able to study some of their specific 'quirks'.<br>
Some quirks are 
due to the specific algorithms that the search engines use. Searching is still 
far from being a completely understood science. There is an 'art' aspect (a 'lore' 
aspect IMO) that plays a role, as you'll see more often than not.
<br><br>The imperative of preparing a good advanced query notwithstanding, all 
searchers like to try a few "quick searches" to test a search engine or a 
query idea. This happens continuously on our <a href="links.htm">messageboards</a>. Thus oddities are found.  
 Typing in a few terms into a blank box and seeing what comes up can be great fun, since 
every now and then, sifting through a pile of less relevant material, you may even 
find some truly
interesting results. More often, something appears that makes you wonder
where it came from. These 'odd' results are at times worth investigating <i>per se</i>, 
since they can help you to reverse engineer the algos used by the main search engines.<bR>
<br> Here some quick masks for the three best search engines:

<br>
Note 
that this search engines "reverse engineering" is actively performed by thousands and 
thousands of little commercial bastards, whose only aim is to spam each and 
every search engine with their pathetic  commercial sites for banal profit purposes.<br><br> 
Yet even this kind of verminous activity can be useful for seekers: some of the 
tricks devised by those commercial hooligans, in order to spam 
the search engines, can open for us whole horizonts of new 
and useful techniques that we will use (and spread) in order to <a href="nemo_SEO.htm">ELIMINATE</a> 
those very spamming sites from the web landscape, when 
searching for knowledge. 
<br><br>
In fact we can - and will - use those same tricks REVERSED, in 
order to cut our queries deep through the spam sites and 
catch the little (and often rare) 
gems we are looking for. I'll make an example: 
 the very moment you find in a 
page  <font color=blue>images with single pixel width/height</font> (webbugs)  that are <u>pointing to the 
main index page</u>  
of a given site (an old Architext trick) you know that you have to do with some evil spammers. And you just need to 
filter such crap out 
from your result lists (SERPs) using simple specific filters... <i>Perilli praemium adipiscunt</i>! Eheh&nbsp;:-)
<br><br>
Other oddities that may appear in your SERPs are due to the fact that all search engines have different 
defaults and basic features, and thus their specific working is 
not always intuitive.<bR><br> 
Often these different settings
are  the culprits that cause those unusual, funny or "false" results.<p>
For example, the default for many Web engines is to <font color=blue>OR</font> terms together, then
provide results based on relevancy. This combination produces a retrieval that
has all terms present in the first  hits, and then fewer terms as you move
to the bottom of your SERPs. This explains why, even though your terms were "ORed"
together,  the last hits 
do not even contain all of your search terms. Unless you specifically ask to AND
terms together, do not trust your search retrievals to accurately portray
the number of hits from your search strategy. <p>
Another typical default is automatic truncation on each term. So if your search
is for <font color=blue>web search</font> you will also retrieve documents with the terms
"searching," "searcher," and even "web-spiders" in them.<p>
Another way of explaining "false" results is by determining exactly what the search
engine is searching. Usually, the default is the URL, but sometimes a search
engine retrieves texts where your search terms appear anywhere in the
document. An address might include your search term, but the actual document may
not show your term when retrieved.<br> Also never forget the quicksand nature of the web: 
you may retrieve a page that indeed  
had your term some time ago, 
but that has been updated in the mean time, whereby your term disappeared.<br>
Seekers can also <a href="fu_speci.htm#disapp">retrieve disappeared pages</a>.<br> 
Pay close attention to any Web engine documentation to
clarify just how and what it searches. All "searching mysteries" can be
solved if you have the time and will to do so.

how to find every IMAGE, every SOUND and -especially- every SCRIPT 
or BOOK or SOFTWARE program known to man. As you will learn and 
understand perusing this side, there is no way anybody can put 
something on the web and block you from seeing it, given the 
weaknesses in all security protections actually available. Of 
course you should respect copyrights, yet you will be quite 
surprised by the incredible amount of knowledge and sheer 
information you will be able to gather from those that <u>do 
not</u> respect them.   Keep in mind that a good searcher can 
develop into a very dangerous fellow, if needs be, since no 
knowledge known to man can be hidden from him. This 
notwithstanding, I hope you  will strive to remain on the correct 
path and choose to diffuse knowledge instead of hoarding it. 
Believe me: you'll gain more than anybody else from this approach.

perform the following query:<br><font size=-1>
<font color=blue>[</font><a href="http://www.northernlight.com/nlquery.fcg?cb=0&qr=search+or+not+search&orl=2%3A1">http://www.northernlight.com/nlquery.fcg?cb=0&qr=search+or+not+search&orl=2%3A1</a><font color=blue>]</font>
</fonT><br>This querystring <font color=blue>search or not search</font> gave in 
March 2001 for Northernlight well over 
322 million URLs... and the first positions were quite interesting <i>per se</i>.<br><br>
The same search on Altavista<br>
<font size=-1><font color=blue>[</font><a href="http://www.altavista.com/cgi-bin/query?sc=on&hl=on&q=search+or+not+search&kl=XX&pg=q&Translate=on&text=yes&search=Search">http://www.altavista.com/cgi-bin/query?sc=on&hl=on&q=search+or+not+search&kl=XX&pg=q&Translate=on&text=yes&search=Search</a><font color=blue>]</font>
<br></fonT>gave in 2001 
"only" 224 million URLs, but this depends on the stop words used in Alta. End 2003 the 
results have been 33 mlillions. But if we search for <a href="http://www.altavista.com/web/results?q=a+OR+NOT+a&kgs=0&kls=1&avkw=aapt">a OR NOT a</a> 
on 
Alta now (end 2003) we get 545 millions.<br>As you can see, 
both these engines have now slided into inisgnificance compared with 
big effective engines (the best in 2003) like <A HREF="google.htm">Google</a>,  <A HREF="introd.htm#teoma">Teoma</a> & <A HREF="fast.htm">Fast</a>.
<br><br>
The real problem is WHICH URLs the search engines cover... alas the "largest" search engines 
cover (at best) only a tiny part of the web. Moreover they DO NOT index the most 
interesting parts of the web: they index commercial over educational sites, US 
sites over European sites 
and 'popular' sites (read sites loved by the zombies) over relatively unknown sites. Moreover 
in their commercial 
'race' to the 'we have indexed one billion pages' tag, the biggest search engines have 
recently begun to bloat the indexes, including  
relatively 'useless' pages (say  in those "3 billions" there is a whole 
collection of 2 millions pages with the images of 
2 million different 
galaxies... that should have been more correctly considered a single database count).<br><br>
This said (even if you'll have to learn other searching techniques, as you will see) the 
<a href="main.htm">main</a> search engines are far from being useless! Note for instance 
how inputting a long exact phrase you'll immediately find 
 a specific page "cutting" it out of the "pudding" masse. For instance this very page! 
<br>Try Teoma's search for<br>
<font size=-1><a href="http://s.teoma.com/search?q=%22The+web+is+uncharted+and+deep.+At+the+time+of+writing+this+snippet+of+mine+there+are+supposed+to+exist%22+&qcat=1&qsrc=1&submit.x=31&submit.y=15">"The web is uncharted and deep. At the time of writing this snippet of mine  there are supposed to  exist"</a>
<br></fonT>
Try it also on Google, where you can use the "<font color=blue>I'm feeling lucky</fonT>" option as well...<br><font size=-1>
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=30&meta=hl%3D%26lr%3D&q=%22The+web+is+uncharted+and+deep.+At+the+time+of+writing+this+snippet+of+mine++there+are+supposed+to++exist%22&sa=I%27m+feeling+lucky">The web is uncharted and deep. At the time of writing this snippet of mine  there are supposed to  exist"</a>
</fonT>


<br>Finally, try it on Fast: <font size=-1>
<a href="http://www.alltheweb.com/search?advanced=1&cat=web&cs=iso-8859-1&type=phrase&q=%22The+web+is+uncharted+and+deep.+At+the+time+of+writing+this+snippet+of+mine+there+are+supposed+to+exist%22+&jsact=&l=pref&ics=iso-8859-1&cs=iso-8859-1&wf%5Bn%5D=3&wf%5B0%5D%5Br%5D=%2B&wf%5B0%5D%5Bq%5D=&wf%5B0%5D%5Bw%5D=&wf%5B1%5D%5Br%5D=-&wf%5B1%5D%5Bq%5D=&wf%5B1%5D%5Bw%5D=&wf%5B2%5D%5Br%5D=&wf%5B2%5D%5Bq%5D=&wf%5B2%5D%5Bw%5D=&dincl=&dexcl=&geo=&limip=&doctype=&dfr%5Bd%5D=1&dfr%5Bm%5D=1&dfr%5By%5D=1980&dto%5Bd%5D=19&dto%5Bm%5D=2&dto%5By%5D=2003&size%5Bp%5D=%3D&size%5Bv%5D=&size%5Bx%5D=0&depth%5Bp%5D=%3E&depth%5Bv%5D=&hits=10&nooc=on">The web is uncharted and deep.

</fonT>

and see (and compare!) the results by yourself.<br><br>Yet the Web is a quicksand, and the algos 
are continuously a-changing, so that our techniques must evolve as well. 
As you'll realize perusing my site, there is <u>a lot</u> to learn and re-learn in this field. 
Collective work and the contributions of my readers are the <i>sine qua non</i> to keep abreast.
Our ultimate aim, as always 
is "simply" to spread for free the light of our knowledge  to anyone that cares.

Maybe you have enough. Maybe this looks too complex and awkward... 
Maybe you wish to go away... Well, 
<!-- thanks nicodemus, december 2001 -->
"thank you for visiting my page, and I do hope you learn something, even if it's 
something as simple as learning the short cut
key to open that darn file explorer (<font color=blue>windows key + e</font>) or the one to minimize 
all windows at once (<font color=blue>windows key + m</font>) or the short cut  you can 
use  when closing the window you'r currently using 
(<font color=blue>ALT+F4</font>)".

teaching is easier than learning, learning is harder than forgetting, forgetting is easier than teaching: the
