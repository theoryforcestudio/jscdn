Can "explaining people how to search files that are on the web" be constructed as "illegal" by some nasty clown?<br>
Since I respect even the most stupid laws, this would really annoy me.<br><br> Let's have a look at the basic 
EU-directive on "copyrights" (read 
<font color=blue>patents</font>, please always remember that  
"intellectual property" and "copyrights" are only cheap and rather sarcastic euphemisms for <font color=blue>patents</font>): 
<a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/lex/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2001:167:0010:0019:EN:PDF">Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 
on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society</a> 
(pdf format, to fetch it in html-format just change the <font color=blue>EN</font> 
in this URL 
<a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2001:167:SOM:en:HTML">http://eur-lex.europa.eu/JOHtml.do?uri=OJ:L:2001:167:SOM:<font color=red>en</font>:HTML</a>
 to any other of the 
EU languages in order to read it -clicking at page 10- translated in your own language, 
here the relevant codes: en, fr, de, it, nl, es, el, pt, sv, da and fi; and, for EU-legislation 
drafted <u>after</u> their respective accession, you might use also   
cs, et, lv, lt, hu, mt, pl, sk, sl, ro and bg)(<font color=red>*</font>). 
<br><br>This <font size="3" color="#0000FF">appallingly restrictive</font> EU Directive is clearly a 
law designed only in order to protect the interests of large media organisations (and probably to please our american masters), 
still the "legislators" couldn't exagerate so much 
as to give away their true aims: when "consumers' rights" "threaten the industry future" you cannot 
simply state that you want to screw those very consumers' rights in order to protect your paymasters.<br>Let's see: 
in the introductory explanations (22) we can read: "The objective of proper support for the dissemination of
culture must not be achieved by sacrificing strict protection
of rights or by tolerating illegal forms of distribution
of counterfeited or pirated works". This is interesting, albeit -of course- very wickedly expressed. 
So we note that the real objective to achieve is NOT "strict protection
of rights" or  "tolerating illegal forms of distribution
of counterfeited or pirated works", the <font color=blue>real</font> objective to achieve, as stated in this 
text, is "proper support for the dissemination of
culture", albeit in achieving it we shold -admittedly- not make excessive sacrifices. I can live with this.<br><br>
For the rest, reading the text of the law, we see (art.3) that one should not "make available to the public... 
 [patented] ...works in such a way
that members of the public may access them from a place and
at a time individually chosen by them" and this we do not. We <u>do not</u> make files available, they are already 
available. We just point out that they are available everywhere, and, 
incidentally, this may even help those very bastards patent-holders and their political lackeys 
to track many repositories of patented files... those clowns may infact learn  as well a couple of things about searching. It won't 
matter a zilch of course: as soon as they stop a loophole, we'll 
find another one: the very <a href="images/visible_hidden2.jpg">STRUCTURE</a> 
of the web was made for <font color="#0000FF">sharing</font>, not 
for selling and not for hoarding,  "cum bona pace" of the patent-obsessed paranoids. <br>
Also we note - with proud and sense of accomplishment - that the objective of "proper support for the dissemination 
of culture" can be achieved -inter alia- also through many of the "webbits" you'll find below.<br><br>
Uff! I can breath again.
<br><br>
Such is the advantage of knowledge: <font color=blue>Fac sapias, et liber eris</font>.
<br><br><hr width=44%>
(<font color=red>*</font>)In 2006 a new directive  was drafted: <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32001L0029:EN:HTML">Directive 2006/116/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2006 on the term of protection of copyright and certain related rights (codified version) </a> (here too, just 
change that uppercase <font color=red>EN</font> inside the address bar 
to any other language to obtain it 
in a different linguistic version) "for harmonisation purposes". Here, in order 
to protect 
"the interests of cultural industries", the hard-lobbied EU-legislators have 
criminally extended 
the patent coverage from 50 to 70 years (article 1)... Come to think of it: best thing all readers can do is to scan, publish and upload 
on their own sites <font size="3" color="#0000FF">every month</font> at least one nice book <u>published exactly 71 years ago</u>!
<br>We should probably launch a web-snowball: "<font size="3" color="#0000FF"><u>Proud to publish another patent-liberated text</u>!</font>", with badge, logo and everything&nbsp;:-)

Hey! This section is mostly for advanced seekers, there's shouldn't be any need to explain too much... either you 
do understand everything, and then some, 
just looking at the examples listed below, or you better 
come back here later... or never again.<br>Yet I'll still begin with a short explanation: <i>homines, dum docent, discunt</i>&nbsp;:-)

<font size=+1>I'll use as a first example a mp3-searching webbit. I repeat: <font color=blue>a  mp3-searching</font>, not <font color=blue>a mp3-stealing</font>, webbit. 
Seekers don't care much for the various copyright and patent crap 
obsessions of the powers that be and of their political lackeys and servants 
because seekers -in fact- NEVER STEAL NOTHING. They don't need to: they find, and 
in so doing just point out how easy it is to share and bypass any silly commercial restriction 
on a web MADE in order to share knowledge: our web. The web was made <font color=blue>for sharing, not for hoarding and not for selling</font>.<br><br>
Hence <i>la va sans dire</i> 
that real seekers do not <font color=blue>need to possess</font> copyrighted music (nor anything else), they just 
<a href="farewell.htm">taste the fruits</a> without 
ruining the plants.<br>
We are forced then to conclude that nature in constituting the seeker made it near and dear 
to itself; for so it comes to repel from him all that is injurious and give him free access to all that is serviceable or akin to it.
 As ole Diogenes pointed out long ago: possessions do not make you vulnerable unless you become attached to them&nbsp;:-) 
 <br><a href="farewell.htm">To live in accordance with the 
 web</a> is the Seekers' conception of the good for man.
<br>
<br> The seeker does 
not need to hoard on his hard disks whatever he has found on the web: all the various images, musics, films, books and 
whatsnot that he fetches on the web... he can just taste, use, evaluate and leave there what he finds, without any need to copy it or 
to "possess" it,  
because he knows that nothing can disappear any more: 
<font color=blue>once anything lands on the web, it will always remain there, copycatted in a zillion 
places and available for the eternity to all those that know how to search</font>&nbsp;:-)<br>
But in order to search effectively, in order to quickly find his targets, wading among the commercial morasses 
and the stinking spam lagoons, he needs a quiver of sharp arrows, and his <font color=blue>webbits</font>, as you will now see, are 
among his most useful tools.
<br><br>Enuff, let's begin. 
The structure of the following quite powerful <a href="rabbits.htm#mp33">mp3-webbit</a>, that I some time ago presented at the educated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_Computer_Club">ccc</a> 
crackers in <a href="private.htm">Berlin</a>,  
has some interesting characteristics, that may be used to exemplify general webbits' structures and purposes (of course 
you should know what <a href="Luxembourg_2006.htm#recallprecision">recall & precision</a> mean when searching the web).<br><br>

<ol><li>
The <font color=blue>group or singer</font> name is mandatory. 
</li><li>
Adding your target's <font color=blue>title</font> can help if you encounter too much noise.
</li><li>
The <font color=blue>format variants</font> will guarantee a broader spectrum. If the search engine you are using is heavily censored (as 
it more and more happens) just eliminate the <font color=blue>mp3</font> parameter. Chances are that in the mp3 lists there will be some 
uncensored
ma4 or some ogg file that will allow their retrieval nevertheless.
</li><li>
The <font color=blue>intitle="index of"</font> (or intitle:index.of, which is the same and avoid two keypresses&nbsp;:-) is mandatory, and 
still allow fairly decent results, the spammers notwithstanding. Of course the <font color=blue>intitle:</font> operator is to be used with 
google, check the different operators for the oher search engines, or just use the simple <font color=blue>"index of"</font> string snippet.
</li><li>
The <font color=blue>-metallica</font> (or -beatles, or whatsnot) serves as a <font color=blue>spamkiller</font>, because many clowns still try 
to fish zombies out of the real web uploading huge lists of groups' names. If you'r going for high recall, then re-launch your query with a different 
group acting as spamkiller.
</li><li>
Finally we come to the <font color=blue>LENGTH</font> parameter, which not only guarantees the 
presence of at least some Megabyte heavy mp3, thus cutting away all the irrelervant noise of those 
bogus "index of" spammer sites with "small snippets" of music, but also can be
varied  <i>ad libitum</i> and will thus guarantee you hours of fishing pleasure. You may try for instance all variations
in the range <font color=blue>1.6M - 6.4M</font>. I suggest starting in the band 3.5-4.5 (which is a good signal ratio for mp3s) and 
moving upwards if you'r an optimist and downwards if you are a pessimist.

<font color=blue>Small FAQ</font><br><b>Q: </b>what is the main problem on the web? <b>A: </b>avoiding commercial idiots.<br> 
        <b>Q: </b>when can you be sure that 
        you are not dealing with commercial idiots?  
        <b>A: </b>When you actually find a site that delivers something, instead of only asking for money/karma/patience/bad taste.<br>
        <b>Q: </b>In the case of serials, how do you avoid commercial idiots? <b>A: </b>Using a working serial as a bait, if possible 
        related with your serial search.<br>

           <b>Q: </b>Why do we have so many software versions, serials, numbers, apparent evolution? I mean, why do we have version 2.0.16 and, two weeks later, version 
           2.0.17 of some crap app?<br>
           <b>A: </b>Coz as soon as slow clumsy <a href="protec/protec.htm">protectors devise a protection</a>, 
           nimble beautiful <a href="softreve.htm">crackers</a> find a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&as_qdr=all&q=%22clever+crackers%22&btnG=Google+Search">clever</a> way to defeat it. And seekers find both: the appz and its nemesis.
            <br>
             <b>Q: </b>But most serialz/cracks refer to older versions of the appz. And these are no more on the web: at the moment 
             you can download only the last uncracked version!<br> 
             <b>A: </b>Nope. ALL versions of <font color=blue>ANY</font> app are on the web, the most recent ones 
             (not yet in the shops) and the older 
             ones (even the programmers forgot them). <br>
 Besides, as ole +ORC pointed out many years 
             ago, <font color=blue>PC-MAGAZINES</font> have published year after year all the older versions...  
             and you can buy 20 kilos old PC magazines with their CD-roms for a couple 
             of euro. A treasure of already serialized/cracked <font color=blue>working</font> older appz and some great cracking 'textbooks' 
             at the same time :-)  <br>           
             &Uuml;brigens: if you learn <a href="http://www.searchlores.org">how to search</a> you will find 
             all and any program at once, whenever you want.

             Of course if you do chose the right seeker's path, and if you do switch over to <a href="linux.htm">GNU/Linux</a>  
             (leaving once fro all the nightmarishly expensive, slow and cumbersome windows OS, 
             with all its sniffing and norton craps & firewalls running in the background), you'll NOT need 
             any more to "buy" or "steal" applications or software. As any kids (but alas much too few adults) know: 
             any GNU/Linux distribution comes for free with ALL POSSIBLE APPLICATIONS 
             completely free, as strange as this may sound to those conditioned to believe that you need to "pay" in order 
             to have a good box wth good software.<bR>
              <b>Q: </b>You mean I should switch over to Linux? But my wondrous (insert name of app or game here) won't work 
              in Linux!<br> 
              <b>A: </b>First of all "Linux" does not exist. The real name of the OS is GNU/Linux, this is more important that 
              you migth believe, for reasons that you will understand once grown up.<br>
              You won't really need "your" 
              (insert name of app or game here). And if you'r really an addict, then  you can easily run a virtual windows OS inside 
              Linux, or probably just use the latest release of <a href="http://www.winehq.org/">wine</a> and run the target **inside** 
              GNU/Linux.
              <br>You might also consider to keep a dual boot GNU/Linux and windows in order to play games, but you'll probably 
              realise after a couple of months that that's just a waste of 
              harddisk space.<br>Fact is that to speed up searches <font color="#0000FF">and</font> have real control of your machine 
              <font color="#0000FF">and</font> guarantee a relative 
              amount of anonimity when surfing, windows and macs are "toy" operating systems in comparison.

                       For instance: <a href="http://www.altavista.com/web/results?enc=iso88591&q=anchor%3Asnowflakes&kgs=0&kls=0&avkw=aapt">anchor:snowflakes</a> or

         All the damned porn sites now have incorporated 
         the "index +of" "parent directory" string right into their keyword Traps now - as i guess you've seen <br><br>

Yes,  MP3-Searching in the web ain't no real fun anymore ;) <br><br>


you can bypass SOME of the fake Traps by using just a few more keywords to get to more legitimate indexs<br><br> 
try       <br>
"index +of" "last Modified" "size" "description" descriptive keyword (mp3?)   <br><br>by Jeff, February 2004<br>    

<br><br> You may try as well: 
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&q=%22parent+directory+%22+MP3+-xxx+-html+-htm+-php+-shtml+-opendivx+-md5+-md5sums">http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&q=%22parent+directory+%22+MP3+-xxx+-html+-htm+-php+-shtml+-opendivx+-md5+-md5sums</a>

A simple music searching approach (using as before <font color=blue>m4a</font>s, that are less censored than <font color=blue>mp3</font>s):<br>
<a target=_top href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&q=%28ma4+OR+mp3%29+%22index+of%22+%2Bgarfunkel&btnG=Search">(ma4 OR mp3) "index of" +garfunkel</a>
For instance:<br>
<a target=_top href="http://violentnation.com/fipilele/">http://violentnation.com/fipilele/</a>
<br>
And you'll also land inside this  huge mp3 pasture,  so big that it may crash evena mighty browser (try it with firefox and it will 
probably grind)...
<br>
<a target=_top href="http://24.91.184.80/jserver/files/music/">http://24.91.184.80/jserver/files/music/</a>
<br><br>Also: 
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&client=opera&rls=en&q=intitle%3A%22index+of%2F%22+%22last+modified%22+%22mp3%22+lady+madonna&btnG=Search">intitle:"index of/" "last modified" "mp3" lady madonna</a>, 
<br>
And at Baidu: <a target=_top href="http://www.baidu.com/s?ie=gb2312&bs=ma4+%22Port+80%22&sr=&z=&wd=mp3+%22Port+80%22&ct=0&cl=3&f=8">mp3 "Port 80"</a>
<br>
(for instance: <a target=_top href="http://www.baidu.com/s?ie=gb2312&bs=mp3+%22Port+80%22+dylan&sr=&z=&wd=mp3+%22Port+80%22+eminem&ct=0&cl=3&f=8">mp3 "Port 80" eminem</a>).
<br><br>
A more complex mp3 "klebing" webbit:<br>
<a target=_top href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&as_qdr=all&q=allintext%3A+ma4+OR+mp3+OR+ogg+%22icons%2Fsound2+gif%22&btnG=Search">
allintext: ma4 OR mp3 OR ogg "icons/sound2 gif"</a><br>
See?  Now you'll have to "peel the URL-onions", backwards, towards the correct targets.
 <hr width=44% align=left>
      <br><br>
Whenever you need some specific music, once again, just fetch it from the web at once.<br>
Using a simple string<br>
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hs=kAI&hl=en&lr=&client=opera&rls=en&q=intitle%3A%22index+of%2F%22+%22last+modified%22+%22mp3%22+garfunkel&btnG=Search">intitle:"index of/" "last modified" "mp3" garfunkel</a>

Hey, who doesn't enjoy downloading some crispy, fresh mp3s at home, tired and aching after a 
long day's work? Here a magic, nice querystring, just smash it inside google: 
<br>
<font color=blue>dylan "snd *.mp3 *-*-2005 *:* *.*m" OR "snd *.mp3 *-*-2005 *:* *.*k" OR "snd *.mp3 *-*-2005 *:* *.*"</font><br>
 and obtain the following link: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=ISO-8859-1&q=dylan++%22snd+*.mp3+*-*-2005+*%3A*+*.*m%22+OR+%22snd+*.mp3+*-*-2005+*%3A*+*.*k%22+OR+%22snd+*.mp3+*-*-2005+*%3A*+*.*%22++&btnG=Search">http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=ISO-8859-1&q=dylan++%22snd+*.mp3+*-*-2005+*%3A*+*.*m%22+OR+%22snd+*.mp3+*-*-2005+*%3A*+*.*k%22+OR+%22snd+*.mp3+*-*-2005+*%3A*+*.*%22++&btnG=Search</a> <br>
 Change dylan to garfunkel, mendelssohn, mozart or whatnots. Change 2005 to 2006 for freshness, or to 2004 (or earlier) for 
 a different (but possibly more stale) search.<br><br>

     <bR>
     Here a very simple, extremely short and yet quite useful webbit. You can launch this (or a very similar one) 
     with any good search engine... even 
     with google...<br><a target=_top href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&hl=en&lr=&q=shakira+%224.6m+%2A+snd%22&btnG=Search">shakira 
     	"4.6m * snd"</a><br>"Grown up" humans will probably substitute 
     "<font color="#0000ff">shakira</font>" with -say- "<a target=_top href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&hl=en&lr=&q=bach+%224.6m+%2A+snd%22&btnG=Search">bach</a>"&nbsp;:-)
     <br>
     Note -again- the added "variable" parameter +"4.6m". 
which is quite important in order to reduce noise and spam (again: you can  modulate as much as you fancy: 4.5, 4.6, 6.2 etc.).<br>
I suggest starting in the range 3.5-4.5 (which is a good signal ratio for mp3s) and 
moving upward if you are an optimist and downward if you are a pessimist.
<br><br> 
       <br>Also pretty good, the <font size="+1" color="#0000FF">%s%</font> trick:<br>

"index of" trick, if you just <u>jump to SERP 3 or onward</u> (<i>hic alta, hic salta</i> we 
used to say; nowaday it is <i>in google, check the caboodle</i>. This is another proof of the scarce effectiveness of 
google anti-spam filters)

<br>
A trick  to make google highlight important parts of the summary with careful usage of asteriscs. For example if we're looking for a big (as possible) recording of rain, we'd use the "index of" trick like that:
<br>
<br><a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=25&hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=utf-8&q=%22index%2Bof%2F%22+%22rain.wav%22&btnG=Google+Search">"index+of/" "rain.wav"</a>
<br>
<br>60 results - but... which one to choose? 
<br>Here is a
better way to gather relevant info:
<br>
<br><a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=25&hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=utf-8&q=%22index%2Bof%2F%22+%22rain.wav%2A%2A%2A%2A%2A%2A%22&btnG=Google+Search">"index+of/" "rain.wav******"</a>
<br>

 <font size=+3>Those annoying news with signing in options</font>
 <br><br>
 Can be easily bypassed... as <b><u>Nemo</u></b> points out:
 <br><br>   <font size=+1>  
 Just thought I'd share this with you... While searching for some 
 info on google I stumbled across a NY Times article. But when I opened 
 the article all I got was the sign in box. darn. So I thought, try 
 google cache, but they were clever enough to add a nocache directive. 
 No luck there.     <br><br>

But the google snippet had some real text from the article, so I know 
they are serving google something different than me. trying to make my 
mouth water by getting the pages included in the google index but snatching 
away the cake before I can eat it! <br><br>

What the boys didn't think of though, was the google translation tool. 
Simply translate the page from X to English and voilla you get served 
the cloaked content! I guess NY Times are going to stuff that hole one day, but 
in the mean time it makes research so much easier!
       <br><br>

That's a neat trick! Probably it should also work for other (news) cloakers... hehehe    </font>

<i>
  This trick is of course -simply put- genial. The idiots that want your data --or your money-- to access their articles 
  MUST INDICIZE those very "hidden" articles on the main search engines in the first time, else no lemming will 
  come and smear his data and/or money around. So the complete text must be SEEN by the search engines' bots.
  <br><br>
  Hence they MUST ALLOW access to the search engines' bots. The more search engines, the more bots... the better.    
  <a href="google.htm">Google</a>, <a href="fast.htm">Fast</a>, <a href="main.htm#Yahoo">Yahoo</a>, 
  <a href="teoma.htm">Teoma</a>, you name them.

  many  <a href="rabbits.htm">webbits</a> tricks, you'r as good a reader as google

by Mariuolo, Dec 2007<br><br>
My dear seekers, I know we come from all over the world but let me say a merry christmas 
and happy new year for all of you! BTW, Today I've learned the existence of <a href="http://lix.in/">http://lix.in/</a>: lix . <br>
For example it is useful if you want to hide your fileshare link from stupid people which alert
 rapidshare and megaupload to cancel them or if you want just find material not so still spammed
  with a simple webbit like this: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%22http%3A%2F%2Flix.in%2F%22&btnG=Search">"http://lix.in/"</a>. 
<br>Of course don't use it for super-secret material.

as diferrent versions have different categories: <br>
[Daily Statistics] [Hourly Statistics] [URLs] [Entry] [Exit] [Sites] [Referrers] [Search] [Agents] [Countries] for example 
<br><br>
This gives 75000 results, but many of them are monthly or other stats, so it's maybe better to provide a filter (~50000):

Not all groups use the "enjoy this fine release" sentence. And also, not only scene groups use it. 
                                                                            <br>
+filetype:nfo still works fine ;) (around 1K nfos indexed by google.)

<font size=+1>
Use Yahoo "<a href="http://siteexplorer.search.yahoo.com/search?">sitesearch</a>" onto your target, and scroll to the bottom of the results' list 
to quickly discover -if you are lucky- whole "forgotten" directories, css, java and other scripts, etcetera.<bR>
You must take account of yahoo's  results upper limit (1000 max): 
Sitesearch ranks results according to popularity, and the juicy targets are always at the bottom of such 
rankings, so 
choose sites (or sites' subdirectories) containing around 1000 (or less) pages!

C'mon, don't be shy&nbsp;:-)
